# `.resources/` Generated Reference Guide (DO NOT EDIT CONTENTS)

## 1. Purpose

Holds generated reference copies of site content organized by type & year for analysis and automation.

## 2. Source of Truth

Original editable content lives in `site/content/**`. NEVER modify files hereâ€”they will be overwritten by automation.

## 3. Generated By

Primary scripts under `.powershell/build/` (e.g., `Update-ResourcesFrontMatter.ps1`, classification & related cache builders) populate & refresh these artifacts.

## 4. Typical Uses

- Tooling / automation input.
- Reference for classification or related-content algorithms.
- Historical organization (year/type) for metrics.

## 5. Safe Actions

- Read / parse.
- Diff to understand changes from a script run.

## 6. Unsafe Actions

- Manual edits (lost next run).
- Renames / deletes (breaks assumptions in scripts).

## 7. If Incorrect Data Found

1. Identify original markdown in `site/content/`.
2. Fix front matter or body there.
3. Re-run appropriate PowerShell script to regenerate.

## 8. Principles

- Immutable between generation passes.
- Always trace back to original content for edits.
