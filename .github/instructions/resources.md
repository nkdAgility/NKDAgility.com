# Generated Resources Directory

⚠️ **DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY**

## `.resources/` Directory

- **Purpose**: Contains reference copies of content organized by type and year
- **Generated by**: PowerShell scripts in `.powershell/build/` folder, primarily:
  - `Update-ResourcesFrontMatter.ps1` - Creates individual resource files organized by type (blog, videos, etc.) and year
  - `Update-ClassificationFrontMatter.ps1` - Creates classification files like `classificationPeers.json` and `classificationHierarchy.json`
  - Various other automation scripts
- **Structure**: Files are organized by resource type (blog, videos, etc.) and year
- **Usage**: Reference and analysis purposes only

**If you need to modify content**: Always edit the original files in `site/content/` directory, not the generated copies in `.resources/`.
