# Resource Creation Guidelines

Resources are educational and thought leadership materials aimed at practitioners and clients seeking to learn. This guide covers the structure, standards, and best practices for creating resources across all resource types.

## Resource Types Overview

The `site/content/resources/` directory contains the following resource types:

### Manually Created Resources

These resource types are created and maintained by content authors:

- **`blog/`** - Articles, thought leadership, and educational content organized by year
- **`case-studies/`** - Client success stories and real-world implementation examples
- **`engineering-notes/`** - Technical deep-dives and engineering best practices
- **`guides/`** - Comprehensive how-to guides and reference materials
- **`learning-series/`** - Multi-part educational series on specific topics
- **`newsletters/`** - Periodic updates and curated content collections
- **`podcast/`** - Podcast episodes and related content (e.g., agile-actually/)
- **`principles/`** - (deprecated) Core principles that guide NKD Agility's work
- **`recipes/`** - Step-by-step facilitation guides for workshops and activities
- **`signals/`** - Short-form insights and observations
- **`workshops/`** - Interactive workshop materials and facilitation guides

### Auto-Generated Resources

⚠️ **DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT** these resource types:

- **`videos/youtube/`** - **AUTO-GENERATED** from YouTube API via PowerShell scripts in `.powershell/` folder
  - Each video is stored in a folder named by its YouTube video ID (e.g., `-Mz9cH0uiTQ/`)
  - Contains `index.md`, captions, and metadata JSON files
  - Regenerated periodically to stay in sync with YouTube content
  - If updates are needed, modify the PowerShell generation scripts, not the files directly

## Resource Structure Standards

### File Organization

Each resource type follows a consistent structure:

#### Blog Posts

```
site/content/resources/blog/
├── YYYY/                          # Year folder
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-slug/          # Date-prefixed folder name
│   │   ├── index.md              # Main content file
│   │   ├── image1.jpg            # Related images
│   │   └── image2.png
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-another-post/
└── _index.md                      # Section index page
```

#### Case Studies, Guides, Workshops, etc.

```
site/content/resources/[type]/
├── resource-slug/                 # Resource folder (use descriptive slug)
│   ├── index.md                  # Main content file
│   └── images/                   # Optional images subfolder
├── another-resource/
└── _index.md                      # Section index page
```

#### Videos (YouTube - Auto-Generated)

```
site/content/resources/videos/
├── youtube/                       # ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT
│   ├── [video-id]/               # YouTube video ID as folder name
│   │   ├── index.md              # Generated content
│   │   ├── captions.en.md        # Generated captions
│   │   ├── data.captions.en.srt  # Generated SRT file
│   │   ├── data.captions.json    # Generated caption data
│   │   └── data.json             # YouTube API response
└── _index.md
```

### Section Index Files (`_index.md`)

Every resource type folder must have an `_index.md` file that defines the section. Example structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Agentic Agility: [Resource Type]"
short_title: "[Resource Type]"
description: "Brief description of this resource type and its purpose"
url: "/resources/[resource-type]/"
layout: "section"
resourceType: [resource-type]
resourceIsSection: true
headline:
  title: "a·gen·tic a·gil·i·ty: [formatted title]"
  content: |
    Longer description of the resource type's purpose and value.
---
Overview of all [Resource Type].
```

## Front Matter Requirements

### Required Front Matter Fields (All Resources)

## Content Standards

### Writing Style

Follow the editorial guidelines in `docs/editorial-content-style-guide.md`:

- **Tone**: Authoritative yet approachable, candid, expert, conversational
- **Voice**: Use first person ("I", "we") and second person ("you") to engage readers
- **Sentence Structure**: Short, clear sentences (15-20 words average); active voice
- **Paragraphs**: Keep to 3-5 sentences; one idea per paragraph
- **Formatting**: Use headings (H2, H3), bullet points, bold for emphasis

### Required Content Elements

#### TL;DR Section

Start with a practical summary:

- Highlight key insights
- Focus on actionable takeaways
- Target development managers and practitioners
- 2-4 sentences or bullet points

#### Main Content

- **Opening**: Hook readers with a compelling introduction
- **Body**: Organize with clear headings and logical flow
- **Examples**: Include real-world examples, metaphors, or analogies
- **Conclusion**: Summarize key points and provide next steps

#### Call-to-Action (Optional but Recommended)

- Invite readers to engage (comment, book consultation, enroll in training)
- Keep it natural and helpful, not salesy
- Link to relevant internal resources

### SEO and Metadata

#### Titles

- **Full Title**: Clear, descriptive, includes primary keywords (50-60 characters)
- **Short Title**: Condensed version for navigation (3-7 words)
- Include power words when appropriate (How, Why, Guide, Ultimate, Essential)

#### Descriptions

- 155-160 characters for optimal search result display
- Include primary keywords naturally
- Make it enticing and actionable
- Preview the value readers will gain

#### Keywords and Taxonomy

⚠️ **Note**: `concepts`, `categories`, and `tags` are auto-generated by `Update-HugoFrontMatter.ps1` based on content analysis. Do not manually edit these fields.

- **Categories**: Broad topics (Scrum, DevOps, Product Development) - auto-generated
- **Tags**: Specific concepts (Sprint Planning, Definition of Done, Technical Debt) - auto-generated
- **Concepts**: Framework-level concepts for advanced organization - auto-generated

#### URLs and Slugs

- Use descriptive, keyword-rich slugs
- Keep slugs concise (3-8 words)
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Avoid dates in slugs (dates in folder names are fine)
- Example: `/resources/blog/pragmatism-crushes-dogma-in-the-wild`

### Images and Media

#### Image Guidelines

- Store images in the same folder as `index.md`
- Use descriptive filenames: `definition-of-done-diagram.png`, not `img1.png`
- Optimize for web (JPEG for photos, PNG for diagrams/screenshots)
- Include alt text in markdown: `![Alt text description](image.png)`
- Set a featured preview image in front matter (`preview:` field)

#### Video Embeds

- For YouTube videos created by NKD Agility, reference them as related content
- Use Hugo shortcodes or approved embed methods
- Provide context: why is this video relevant here?

#### Diagrams and Charts

- Prefer branded NKD Agility graphics when available
- Ensure diagrams are clear and readable
- Add captions to explain complex visuals
- Use consistent styling and colors

### Internal Linking

Link to related internal content to:

- Provide additional context
- Keep readers on the site (improves SEO)
- Build a knowledge web across resources

Use Hugo ref shortcodes:

```markdown
[Scrum Guide]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}})
[Definition of Done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}})
```

Link the first occurrence of a concept in each major section.

### External References

When citing external sources:

- Use authoritative sources (Scrum.org, industry reports, academic studies)
- Embed links in descriptive anchor text
- Example: `[15th State of Agile Report](https://url)`, not `[click here](https://url)`
- Maintain a "References" or "Further Reading" section if multiple sources are used

## Creating New Resources

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Determine Resource Type**
   - Choose the appropriate folder: blog, case-studies, guides, etc.
   - Check if it should be in a year subfolder (blog, newsletters) or direct subfolder

2. **Create Resource Folder**

   ```powershell
   # For blog posts
   New-Item -Path "site/content/resources/blog/2025/2025-11-28-my-post-title" -ItemType Directory

   # For other resources
   New-Item -Path "site/content/resources/workshops/my-workshop-name" -ItemType Directory
   ```

3. **Create `index.md` File**
   - Use the appropriate archetype if available
   - Copy front matter from a similar existing resource as a template
   - Fill in all required fields (except auto-generated ones)
   - **DO NOT manually set**: `ItemId`, `ItemType`, `ItemKind`, `ItemContentOrigin`, `ResourceId`, `ResourceType`, `resourceTypes`, `concepts`, `categories`, `tags`, `short_title`, `description`, `tldr`, `slug`, `aliases`, `weight`, `sitemap`, `Watermarks`

4. **Run Front Matter Generation Script**

   ```powershell
   .powershell\build\Update-HugoFrontMatter.ps1
   ```

   - This script automatically generates:
     - `ItemId` - Unique identifier for the resource
     - `ItemType` - Resource type (blog, videos, workshops, etc.)
     - `ItemKind` - Always set to "resource"
     - `ItemContentOrigin` - Content origin (Hybrid, AI, Manual)
     - `ResourceId` - Same as ItemId
     - `ResourceType` - Resource type classification
     - `resourceTypes` - Resource type array
     - `concepts` - Related framework concepts
     - `categories` - Broad topic classifications
     - `tags` - Specific concept tags
     - `short_title` - AI-generated shortened title (max 40 chars)
     - `description` - AI-generated SEO-optimized description
     - `tldr` - AI-generated practical summary for managers
     - `slug` - URL-friendly slug derived from title
     - `aliases` - URL redirects (includes ItemId and slug variations)
     - `weight` - Priority score based on classification (0-1000)
     - `sitemap` - Search engine sitemap configuration
     - `Watermarks` - Timestamps tracking when AI fields were last updated
   - **⚠️ NEVER manually edit these fields** - always regenerate using the script

5. **Write Content**
   - Follow editorial guidelines
   - Include TL;DR section
   - Use clear headings
   - Add images and media as needed
   - Proofread for clarity and correctness

6. **Review Auto-Generated Metadata**
   - After running the script, review the generated fields
   - **Note**: All metadata including weight, sitemap, description, aliases, categories, tags, and concepts are auto-generated by the script in step 4
   - Only manually edit: `title`, `date`, `creator`, `preview` (featured image), and resource-specific fields
   - DO NOT manually edit any fields marked as AUTO-GENERATED

7. **Test Locally**

   ```powershell
   hugo server --source site --config hugo.yaml,hugo.local.yaml
   ```

   - Check the resource displays correctly
   - Verify images load
   - Test all links
   - Review on mobile and desktop views

8. **Regenerate Front Matter Before Committing**
   ```powershell
   .powershell\build\Update-HugoFrontMatter.ps1
   ```

   - Always run this script before committing to ensure all auto-generated fields are up-to-date
9. **Commit and Deploy**
   - Commit to git with a descriptive message
   - Push to repository
   - Preview in staging environment if available
   - Monitor for build errors

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Editing Auto-Generated Content**: Never manually edit files in `videos/youtube/` - modify the generation scripts instead
2. **Manually Editing Auto-Generated Front Matter**: Never manually edit `ItemId`, `ItemType`, `ItemKind`, `ItemContentOrigin`, `ResourceId`, `ResourceType`, `resourceTypes`, `concepts`, `categories`, `tags`, `short_title`, `description`, `tldr`, `slug`, `aliases`, `weight`, `sitemap`, or `Watermarks` fields - always use `.powershell\build\Update-HugoFrontMatter.ps1` to generate these
3. **Inconsistent Taxonomy**: Categories and tags are auto-generated; don't manually add or modify them
4. **Forgetting to Run Front Matter Script**: Not running `Update-HugoFrontMatter.ps1` before committing changes
5. **Missing Aliases**: Always set aliases for important URLs to prevent broken links
6. **Poor SEO**: Don't skip the description field or use generic descriptions
7. **Weak Titles**: Avoid clickbait, but do use compelling, specific titles
8. **No Internal Links**: Missing opportunities to connect related content
9. **Image Optimization**: Uploading huge images that slow page load
10. **Ignoring Editorial Guide**: Content that doesn't match NKD Agility's voice and style
11. **No TL;DR**: Leaving out the practical summary section
