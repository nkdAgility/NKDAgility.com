# Content Management

- All content is written in Markdown format in the `site/content` directory
- Images are stored in subdirectories alongside content files
- The website uses various taxonomies (tags, categories, etc.) defined in `hugo.yaml`
- Always edit original files in `site/content/`, not generated copies in `.resources/` or `.data/`
