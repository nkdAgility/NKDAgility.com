        Thanks for helping improve our course content! This template will help you request syllabus updates using our standardized syllabus system.

        All courses use the **immersive format** with external **syllabus.yaml** files for better maintainability.

        ðŸ“– **Reference**: See [syllabus-system.md](../docs/syllabus-system.md) for detailed documentation on the syllabus system.

        **Note**: Course overview, learning objectives, and target audience should be maintained in the course's front matter. This issue will also update the course front matter with `course_sessions` and `course_length` fields if provided.
