        Thanks for helping improve our course content! This template will help you request syllabus updates using our standardized syllabus system.

        All courses use the **immersive format** with external **syllabus.yaml** files for better maintainability.

        ðŸ“– **Reference**: See [syllabus-system.md](../docs/syllabus-system.md) for detailed documentation on the syllabus system.

        **Note**: Course overview, learning objectives, and target audience should be maintained in the course's front matter. This issue will also update the course front matter with `course_sessions` and `course_length` fields if provided.

        ## Processing Instructions

        ### Issue Processing Workflow:
        - [ ] **Locate Course**: Use the course code to find the course directory in `site/content/capabilities/training-courses/`
        - [ ] **Update Front Matter**: Add/update `course_length` and `course_sessions` fields in the course's `index.md` front matter if provided
        - [ ] **Create/Update Syllabus**: Process the provided YAML content into the course's `syllabus.yaml` file
        - [ ] **Validate Structure**: Ensure YAML syntax is correct and session durations align with total course hours
        - [ ] **Review Assignments**: Verify assignments follow immersive format principles (outcome-focused, adaptable, real-world application)
        - [ ] **Quality Check**: Confirm content meets NKD Agility training standards and aligns with target delivery audiences

        ### Key Validation Points:
        - [ ] **YAML Syntax**: Must be valid and properly formatted
        - [ ] **Duration Alignment**: Session durations should total to course hours unless specified otherwise
        - [ ] **Assignment Quality**: Focus on outcomes rather than specific outputs
        - [ ] **Learning Objectives**: Clear connection between sessions and course goals
        - [ ] **Immersive Format**: Assignments emphasize real-world application and reflection
