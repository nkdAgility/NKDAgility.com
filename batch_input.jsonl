The official guidance around Visual Studio 2010 has been created by the Visual Studio ALM Rangers and is a brew of a bunch of really clever guys experiences working with the tools and customers.\n\n- **Updated 16th February 2011** - Added link to Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects Guidance\n\n---\n\nI will be creating a series of posts on the different guidance options as many people still do not know about them ![Smile](images/Do-you-know-about-the-Visual-Studio-ALM-_D18D-wlEmoticon-smile_2-2-2.png) even though [Willy-Peter Schaub](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub) has done a fantastic job of making sure they get the [recognition](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2009/08/07/vsts-rangers-introducing-the-vsts-rangers-recognition-program.aspx) they deserve. There is a full list of all of the [Rangers Solutions and Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ee358787) on MSDN, but I wanted to add my own point of view to the usefulness of each one. If you don’t know who the rangers are you should have a look at the [Visual Studio ALM Rangers Index](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2010/06/18/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-an-index-to-all-rangers-covered-on-this-blog.aspx) to see the full breadth of where the rangers are.
