      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s episode of Agile Actually, we picked up some whispers on the #agile winds about #productmanagement being obsolete.

      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s edition of #agileactually, Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in #agile for a life coach to present themselves as an #agilecoach to organizations.&#xA;In most cases, an #agilecoach or #agilecosultant will have years of experience as an #agilepractitioner, actively working in an #agileteam, followed by certification and practise as an #agilecoach leading multiple #agileteams in multiple applications.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s controversial that someone with very little #professionalcoaching skills and #agile knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an #agilecoach.</description>

A deep recession that is anticipated to last until the second quarter of 2024.&#xA;So, what does your organization need to focus on to initially survive, and then thrive, through this period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity?</description>

      <description>As a fellow agilist, you’ll know that agility is critical to success in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous 21st-century marketplace.&#xA;Why? Because it empowers us to run experiments, frequently inspect, and regularly adapt. That’s how we navigate complexity. That’s how we create value, despite uncertainty, regardless of the industry or environment we serve.&#xA;How much Tupac have you got? How skilled, competent, and capable are you in navigating the competitive landscape we find ourselves in?</description>

I for one have found it better all around!</description>
