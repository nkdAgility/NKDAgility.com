      <description>In this month&amp;rsquo;s episode of Agile Actually, we picked up some whispers on the #agile winds about #productmanagement being obsolete. The idea that if you have a strong #productowner in #scrum, there is no need for a #productmanager at all.&#xA;To explore this concept, we invited Ralph Jocham - a #productmanager and #productowner expert - to talk about the differences between product ownership and product management and whether these whispers held any truth.</description>

      <description>The world is spinning faster than ever, with more players than ever.&#xA;The introduction of Chat GPT has excited a few people but alarmed many. Sure, Chat GPT is nowhere near as bright as many of the other AI projects in play. Still, it is already showing how mediocre, repeatable work can be designated to AI or automated. This a glimpse of a future where the minimum standard won’t be enough, and you’ll need to dig deeper and deliver high-value work.</description>

      <description>Learning about scrum is important, but growing your capability to deploy and implement scrum effectively is way more important.&#xA;All the theory in the world doesn’t help if your team are grappling with the action elements. Actively doing the work, creating the product implement, integrating customer feedback and data into decision-making for the next product evolution. It often isn’t scrum that is the problem, it is a fundamental lack of knowledge and understanding around the core pillars of Empiricism that under pin scrum.</description>

      <description>While all of our courses are centred around valuable learning outcomes achieved through experiential learning within a classroom environment, they are most often delivered as intense consecutive 2-day or 4-half-day experiences.&#xA;This compresses learning into a short space of time and minimises not only the amount that folks remember but also denies them the ability to try things and come back to the trainer.&#xA;To combat this we have already moved from a 2-full-day format to 4-half-days and added:</description>

From Amazon to Meta, and heaps of smaller organizations across the board.&#xA;In conjunction with this, we’ve also seen a great deal of predictions for a rough 2023 from an economic perspective. A deep recession that is anticipated to last until the second quarter of 2024.&#xA;So, what does your organization need to focus on to initially survive, and then thrive, through this period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity?</description>

Because it empowers us to run experiments, frequently inspect, and regularly adapt. That’s how we navigate complexity. That’s how we create value, despite uncertainty, regardless of the industry or environment we serve.&#xA;How much Tupac have you got?

      <description>Scrum Teams flourish when the Scrum Master and Product Owner accountabilities are well fulfilled. The 3-day Professional Scrum Master and Product Owner (PSMPO) course combines the key learning objectives from both the Scrum.org Professional Scrum Master™ (PSM) and Professional Scrum Product Owner™ (PSPO) courses. Merging PSM and PSPO together enables side-by-side learning in a way that is not possible when Scrum Masters and Product Owners are trained separately. These learners greatly benefit from having a shared understanding for one another and by blending the content, students avoid duplicate foundational content and have more space to focus on learning together.</description>
