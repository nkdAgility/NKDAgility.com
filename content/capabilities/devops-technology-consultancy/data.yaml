    <p>Our DevOps consultants work with organisations to help them get the most
    out of their DevOps strategy and maximise its effectiveness.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We conduct health checks to assess your organisationâ€™s current State of
    DevOps. We meld this discovery with our experience to advise changes to the
    existing ways of working, culture and tooling to achieve the objectives. We
    design training programs to educate teams and help them change. Following
    training, we can coach and mentor during the next evolution as everyone
    works towards achieving the outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

    DevOps Consultancy Approach</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Change is evolutionary, not transformational, and for that you and your
    people need to understand DevOps so that you and your people can continue to
    evolve your organisation.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We use our knowledge and experience in evolutionary change, using the
    DevOps mindset and lean thinking, to help organisations achieve their
    outcomes. We work with leadership to identify the outcomes that they want to
    accomplish and train teams in the agile mindset and lean thinking. For any
    of the outcomes, we will work with you using&nbsp;<a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/">evidence-based
    management</a>&nbsp;techniques to define how we will measure success.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Using an evidence-based mindset, along with this definition of success,
    we will examine the maturity and health of the organisation. This can have
    many different elements and almost always include Innovation Rate,
    On-Product Index, Usage Index, and Installed Version Index, as these key
    measures are known to be lacking in most organisations.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We analyse the data to understand the current state and create and adapt
    any recommendations tailored to the organisation. These recommended changes
    may include processes, practices, tools, organisational dynamics and
    culture. We propose short, quick, incremental changes in the journey to
    achieving successful outcomes. Using an iterative approach allows us the
    flexibility to measure success continually and change direction if
    needed.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Our approaches use the latest DevOps and lean practices to help you
    improve.</p>
