  - "<p>You may have noticed that over the last month or so I have been neglecting my blog (too many personal posts) and my focus on development in general. This has been a temporary setback due mostly to starting a new job and not getting to play with Team Server at the moment (plus I had a knee operation the other week). So for now, I will be trying to focus more on Sharepoint 2007 / MOSS and the feature deficient Sharepoint 2003.</p> <p>My new job entails maintaining a heavily customized Sharepoint 2003 deployment and some other nick knacks, while deploying MOSS for the company I am now with. I am quickly expanding my knowledge of Sharepoint from that additional bit bolted onto Team Foundation Server to a more rounded look at its enterprise deployment and integration with other systems.</p> <p>I will need to migrate and integrate a number of other applications into MOSS including:</p> <ul> <li>Sharepoint Server Portal</li> <li>over 500 team sites in Sharepoint 2003 (Created over time, with no structure...Oh my!)</li> <li>a BI Portal built on Reporting Services and Crystal Reports</li> <li>an extensive intranet that incorporates many Sharepoint like features and an extensive custom workflow system</li> <li>an HR Administration function site</li></ul> <p>This is not an exhaustive list, but those applications that I have either found or been made aware of, and it does not by any measure include the future work already being talked about within the company on workflow and automation.</p> <p>At least I have some help, a nice guy from New Iberia (Hi Michael!) and a Gal from Chicago who are both currently snowed under with the current work on the systems.</p> <p>This should be fun... </p> <p><img src=\"http://www.canaryforum.com/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif\" /></p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS\" rel=\"tag\">MOSS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint\" rel=\"tag\">SharePoint</a>\_</div>"
