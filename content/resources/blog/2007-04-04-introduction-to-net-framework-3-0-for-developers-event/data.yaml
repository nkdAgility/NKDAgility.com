  - "<p>Yesterday I visited the\_Strathclyde University campus to see a half day session from Microsoft's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx\">Mike Taulty</a>.</p>\n<p>It was very informative, and although I have been developing in .NET 3.0 for around three months there were some areas that I was sketchy on. Specifically \"CardSpace\" and its use and benefits. A number of other delegates also had concerns which I also shared. Mike managed to answer them effectively for me, I am not sure about the others, and I can see the use of CardSpace as a single sign on solution that does not require a username or password.</p>\n<p>Mike seams to have a thing for Windows Workflow Foundation as he got carried away with that part of the session and had to skip most of <a title=\"Windows Communication Foundation\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wcf.netfx3.com\">Windows Communication Foundation</a>. I totally agree with him that WF is an excellent piece of work and fills a niche that prior to WF us developers needed to either code ourselves or pay exorbitant costs for a third party product.</p>\n<p>Although I had heard about 60% of the session before, it was well worth while as there were many bits that helped the rest fall into place...</p>\n<p>I was especially interested in a class property manager thingy that is used in workflow. I did not get a chance to enquire of Mike if this can be used by developers independently of WF, but I can see many of the advantages of using it.</p>\n<p>Mike, if you are listening, and can decipher my cryptic description, can you answer this?</p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/.NET\" rel=\"tag\">.NET</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      I have spoken to Mike and explaned what a "Class Property Manager Thingy"
      is and he has helpfully identified the offending material:<br /><br
      />Class Property Manager Thingy = Attached properties<br /><br />Read
      about them here:
      http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/archive/2005/08/25/456024.aspx<br /><br
      />If I can figure out how to get them onto my own classes, then I will let
      you know!
