    going to work at Microsoft… well I am, kind of. I have just started an
    engagement that will see me working as a Technical Product Manager as part

    <p>An Orange badge (or “v dash” because of the v-username format) is an
    external vendor consulting inside of Microsoft. The Director of the VSIP
    team (Tom) has tagged me to help him better leveraging and understand the
    space between <a href="https://vsipprogram.com" target="_blank">Microsoft
    Visual Studio Industry Partners</a> and the Visual Studio product. This is
    an awesome opportunity to personally expand and allow the VSIP team to
    leverage my skills as an ALM Consultant, ALM MVP and ALM Ranger to the
    fullest to, hopefully, benefit both sides of this awesome sandwich.</p>

    Map</strong></p> <p>My key focus will be on:</p> <ul> <li> <h3>Opportunities
    for partners to extend Visual Studio</h3> <p>There are many extensibility
    points in the Visual Studio stack from client to server and back again, but
    not all of them are being leveraged by the field. There are currently over
    180+ VSIP members that are leveraging the benefits of a program designed to
    foster collaboration and growth of an ecosystem around Visual Studio and we
    want to grow that. In addition we need to understand where the partners fir,
    where they are going and what Microsoft can do to support them… a roadmap if
    you will.</p> </li><li> <h3>Opportunities for Visual Studio to be
    extended</h3> <p>There are many gaps in the extensibility that if this or
    that API was just tweaked a little we could get some awesome developer tools
    working. This is where I will be leasing heavily with the Product Teams for
    Visual Studio and Team Foundation Serve to make use that the extensibility
    points that the vendors want to leverage are up to par or even exist at all.
    This will enable Visual Studio to better support the partners and vice a
    versa.</p></li></ul> <p>My first task was defining a new taxonomy to fit out
    partners into as the old one was a little too low level with “ASP.NET” and
    “MVC” on the list. We went with parity to the general “Define”, ‘Develop”
    and “Operate” strategy that will help us better understand where the VSIP
    partners sit and where any gaps are.</p> <p><a

    with Visual Studio</strong></p> <p>I am really exited about this not just as
    an opportunity to work more closely with the Product Team and get involved
    in the cool goings on in the vendor community, but also to grow as a
    consultant and take on new challenges. Over the last year and a half I have
    gone from being a Technical Consultant to a Process Consultant and
    Professional Scrum Trainer, and that is no easy transition&nbsp; while
    maintaining&nbsp; your technical competence. I do feel that some of my low
    level technical skills have dribbled out of my ears to make room for some of
    the other stuff, but hopefully not much.</p> <p>Now adding to that the
    Product Management role which is very different from those that have gone
    before will be the next challenge. Also balancing that on a part time basis
    will be even more fun…</p> <p><strong>Do you integrate with Visual Studio?
    Did it fit into the new taxonomy?</strong></p>
