    <p class="lead">You get an error while upgrading Team Foundation Server 2012
    to Update 1 with a “TF254027: You must correct all errors before you
    continue”, “TF255375: the configuration database that you specified cannot
    be used” and a “TF255430: the database was partially upgraded during a
    failed upgrade”.</p>

    <p>The result of this is that you have an inaccessible environment until it
    is either upgraded successfully or restored to the RTM.</p>

    <p>The only way to figure out what went wrong it to look at the log. You can
    see the little “Open Log” option in the results and there is also an “Open
    Log folder” as part of the “Logs” node in the Administration Console.</p>

    <p>On examining the logs the first thing that I found was a SQL Server
    communication error.</p>

    <p>This would defiantly cause the upgrade to fail and if it happened half
    way through the Upgrade of the Configuration database would defiantly result
    in the messages above. Now, prior to running the upgrade the TFS Upgrade
    Wizard did check that not only could it connect to SQL Server correctly, but
    that the accounts in use had the appropriate permissions to perform the
    update.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure: TF400670: Error encountered when creating connection to
    Analysis Services</strong>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>It looks like this might be the culprit as it is followed by an
    “UpgradeConfigDB: Error” statement. Again it looks like a network glitch
    trying to open a connection to the SQL Server that was hosting Analysis
    Services. With these two errors I would surmise that there might be an
    intermittent network problem that while a running server would be resilient
    to it an upgrade is a much longer transactional process and thus hit the
    issue.</p>

    <p>Following the instructions and&nbsp; restoring the backup and rerunning
    should solve the issue as it is not an issue with the upgrade itself.</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">Solution for TF255430&nbsp;– Restore your data
    from a backup</h3>

    <p>As this really all boils down to the TF255430 then we should follow the
    instructions above as “You must restore your data from a backup to its
    original state to continue”.</p>

    <p>In this case we restored the collection, re-ran the update and all was
    well.</p>

    <p>If you are installing any updates to Team Foundation Server follow these
    simple steps:</p>

    <ol>

    <li><strong>Analyse<br /></strong>Run the Best Practices Analyser to make
    sure that your TFS Server is healthy and highlight any problems that you can
    fix first</li>

    <li><strong>Quiesce <br /></strong>Make your TFS and SharePoint environments
    inaccessible so that the backups are all at the same version</li>

    <li><strong>Backup</strong><br />Backup all data using the Team Foundation
    Server backup tool from the power tools</li>

    <li><strong>Snapshot</strong><br />Make sure that you take a Snapshot of
    both your application tier and data tier at the same time index.</li>

    <li><strong>Update</strong><br />You should make sure that all of the
    components of your Team Foundation Server environment are up to data. That
    means installing ALL Microsoft Updates for both Windows and other
    products.</li>

    <li><strong>Upgrade</strong><br />Then run the upgrade with the knowledge
    that you have done everything possible to make sure things go smoothly.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>These simple steps should mitigate any future issues and should find any
    communication issues as well…</p>
