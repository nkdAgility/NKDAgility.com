  - "<p class=\"lead\">Did you skip reporting and now you want to integrate reporting and analyses services with Team Foundation Server 2013?</p>\n<p>Lets assume for a minute that you did not install Reporting Servers or Analysis Services with your install of Team Foundation Server 2013. I often get asked if you can add it later… and the answer is a resounding yes. This might be the same procedure if you want to have Analysis Services and Reporting Services on separate server for performance or if you just choose not to install it or even if you started with TFS Basic.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image69.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Creating awesome reports</small></p>\n<p>There are only a few steps to get this working:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services and Analysis Services</li>\n<li>Configure SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services</li>\n<li>Enable reporting and analyses services for your Team Foundation Server<ol>\n<li>Enable reporting and analyses services at the Team Project Collection</li>\n<li>Enable reporting and analyses services for your Team Project Collection</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Install SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services and Analysis Services</h2>\n<p>The very first thing to do is to create your Analysis Services and Reporting Services instance for you to link into Team Foundation Server 2013. In this case I am adding them both to my existing instance of SQL Server so lets fire up the SQL Server installer.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image51.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br />Figure: Add features to an existing implementation</p>\n<p>Once you have mounted the ISO and fired off the installer you should select “Install” and then “New SQL Server stand-alone installation or add features to an existing implementation”. We will get to choose later which one we want to do… As you go through the installer it will check for pre-requisites and other shenanigans. I really do wonder why it makes me click next all of the time on screens with no options. It should only stop and tell me when it can’t proceed.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image52.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Select your existing instance</small></p>\n<p>There is no licence required to use SQL Server Standard with Team Foundation Server but you need to make sure that you are in single or dual server move to take advantage of it. If you scale out to have an Analysis, SharePoint or Reporting farm you will need additional licences for all of the products involved. Here we are choosing to add features to the existing instance specified in the pick-list. There will likely only be one option…</p>\n<p>Note: You also can’t add any other databases to the server or you would also require additional licencing. Keep things clean and by the book and you are free and clear.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image53.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Add Analysis and Reporting</small></p>\n<p>Although you only need to add “Analysis Services” and “Reporting Services – Native” I have gone ahead and also added the “Client Tools Connectivity” as I always have the impression that is it required and I would not want to have to subject myself to the SQL Server installer a third time.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image54.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Using the default credentials is recommended</small></p>\n<p>I would always recommend that you use the default credentials where possible as this minimised customisation and points of failure. When you install application under their default credentials they usually use the machine account in Active Directory. This means that they are automatically granted the correct rights. Did you know that the account that is used for SQL Server required additional privileges in Active Directory to manipulate Service Principal Names (SPN). If it does not have that permission then you could be fumbling around for why something does not work for hours…I know I have before. Default rules…</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image55.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Add administrator permissions</small></p>\n<p>For my demo box I am adding all Domain Admins to have administrator permission to Analysis Services by default. This should stop me from being locked out which I have been on occasion.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image56.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Reporting Services configuration options</small></p>\n<p>For some reason I am not able to select “Install and Configure”. I can only assume that this is because I am adding features and not installing afresh, but I have no idea why the restriction is there. Would that the SQL Server team would use the TFS installer. We will need to configure it manually later…</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image57.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: All installed successfully</small></p>\n<p>Now that we have everything installed we need to pick up the pieces from the deficiencies of the SQL Server installer and configure Reporting Services so that we can use it.</p>\n<h2>Configure SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services</h2>\n<p>Configuring SQL Server 2012 Reporting Services is very strait forward. We need to create the site, the web services and a database to hold the data.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image58.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Reporting Services Configuration</small></p>\n<p>First we need to launch the Reporting Services configuration tool which will have been added to your application links list. Just search for it on your Start page.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image59.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Connect to your RS instance</small></p>\n<p>You need to specify what instance you are configuring. Here ewe are connecting to the local server’s default instance.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image60.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Create Web Service</small></p>\n<p>First select the Web Service URL node on the left and click “Apply”…</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image61.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Create the Database</small></p>\n<p>Second click on the ‘Database” node and take all of the defaults. If you have to enter a database name then pick something custom and cryptic… like “ReportingData”.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image62.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Configure Website</small></p>\n<p>And the last thing to do is to select “Report Manager URL” on the left and again click Apply.</p>\n<p>Do you see why I think it is not outside the realm of possibility for the SQL Team to allow auto configuration.</p>\n<p>DONE</p>\n<h2>Enable reporting and analyses services for your Team Foundation Server</h2>\n<p>If all we were doing was installing and configuring Analysis Services and Reporting Services then we would now be done. However we want to have an integrated solution with Team Foundation Server so there eare a few other steps that we need to complete. We need to integrate our new instances into TFS and then enable data services for each of the collections.</p>\n<h3>Enable reporting and analyses services at the Application Tier</h3>\n<p>We need to first tell Team Foundation Server where to store all of that lovely data and reports. So head on over to the Team Foundation Server Administration Console so that we can get started.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image63.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Enable and configure Warehouse</small></p>\n<p>There are 4 things to configure but the first one is a checkbox. Tick the box to “Use Reporting” first and then fill out the details for where you want your data warehouse stored. I would recommend the default of “Tfs_Warehouse”.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image64.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Configure Analysis Services</small></p>\n<p>Now head over to the second tab and enter the database as “Tfs_Analysis” for your analysis services cube. Here you will also want to specify the credentials to be used for the reporting services data sources to connect to. This will add that account to the “TfsDataReader” group.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image65.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Configure Reports</small></p>\n<p>If you fill out the server name, the local server should be already in the pick-list, then you should see the URL’s automatically populated. If you need custom URL’s then you should add them to Reporting Services using the Reporting Services Configuration tools and you will then be able to select them from this drop down list.</p>\n<p>Again enter the credentials that you want to use for reporting, this time TFS will add this to the data sources and the credentials to use.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image66.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Rebuild the Warehouse and Cube</small></p>\n<p>I am fairly sure that a rebuild is automatically kicked off when we configured the setting but just for good measure I hit the “Start Rebuild” button.</p>\n<h3>Enable reporting and analyses services at the Team Project Collection</h3>\n<p>And the last little piece is to enable each of your collections to store data in the reports server. You don’t have to enable every collection but you do have to enable the wans that you want to have data in the cube from.</p>\n<p><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"image\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image67.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" border=\"0\" /><br /><small>Figure: Enable Collection for Reporting</small></p>\n<p>This will configure your collection to look for a folder of the name displayed and for a folder for each of the Team Projects under that. Not as versatile as the SharePoint site configuration but enough to get your data\_ flowing.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately enabling the reporting does not go an add the correct reports to the server. You would need to download the correct reports from the Process Template and import them manually to the location specified above with the addition of the Team Project name. If the power tools for 2013 were available there is a “AddReporting” command line to do this for you.</p>\n<p>Give me a shout if you have any questions or get into trouble…</p>"

      Hi Martin,


      I have run into an issue trying to re-deploy the standard SSRS reports
      after having to rebuild our TFS server from scratch (Dell hardware issue).
      Luckily we didn't lose any data but we lost our reporting services
      reports. I am running into the following error


      Event Description: TF30162: Task "ProcessConfiguration" from Group
      "WorkItemTracking" failed

      Exception Type: Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client.PcwException

      Exception Message: The following element contains an error:
      PortfolioBacklog(Microsoft.FeatureCategory). TF400522: The following value
      is not a valid work item category: Microsoft.FeatureCategory. You must
      specify a valid category.


      I believe that we are seeing this because when you were here in October we
      replace the out-of-the-box PortfolioBacklog of category
      Microsoft.FeatureCategory with a custom category called
      Microsoft.ReleaseCategory. Basically, this took the features backlog and
      allowed us to track our releases via the Kanban board (working out great
      by the way).


      Do you have any ideas about how we can deploy these reports again using
      our current configuration?



      Thanks so much!

      Mick, This is usually due to a mismatch between the process template you
      have selected and the one in place. Because you are, under the covers,
      using the Project Creation Wizard it has checked and found a mismatch. 


      I don't remember wither we crated a custom process template, or just
      created an in place change. If it was an in place change you will need to
      create a process template that matches.... (from memory so steps may not
      be exact)


      1) Download the Scrum 2013 process template

      2) Export all of custom work item types, category, &amp; process
      configuration files from your live project

      3) Overwrite the files in the Scrum 2013 template with the ones you just
      exported

      4) open processtemplate.xml in the root of the Scrum process template and
      change the name to [yourcompany Scrum 2013]

      5) Upload this new template

      6) Call tfpt createreports using this new template name and it should work
      just fine.

      Let me know if this worked...

      Hi Martin,



      We went down a slightly different route because I wasn't comfortable with
      updating the process template because we had made other adjustments. So, I
      did the following  



      1. Downloaded the Scrum template using the TFS Power Tools

      2. Manually uploaded each .rdl into SSRS.

      3. Failed to get the Reports working

      4. Ended up having to manually update every single data set in every
      report because the SSRS data connections were invalid 


      I have no clue why the data connections weren't valid in any of the
      reports, but I managed to work around the problem okay.

      That's the manual process :) the data connections are always invalid and
      you have to se them manually. What you just did is all that the tfpt
      createreports command does for you...


      Glad that you got it sorted... just ping me for help any time...

      Hi Martin, 

      Can we add reporting services to the hosted version of TFS2013? I
      appreciate a quick response. 

      Thanks,

      No - You can only add RS to a local instance. I do believe that you can
      deploy the Tabular Model

      Thank you. I'll see if that helps. All we need is to get the test results
      to be stored and to be seen at any point of time. I'm wondering if there
      is any other way other than using reporting services. I appreciate your
      help.

      You can use Excel... If you connect Excel to the Cube and Warehouse you
      can get that info... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms244699.aspx

      Martin, I know that there is no license required for SQL 2012 , but what
      about 2014?  TFS was originally installed using 2014 Express without
      Reporting Services...now Reporting &amp; Analysis is it is being
      considered but we'd prefer NOT to try and downgrade the database to 2012.

      Thanks Martin for this succinct and clear guide.  It should be  noted that
      this works exactly the same for TFS 2012.

      I am hitting a similar issue, but not exactly the same.  My error is 


      TF400587: This element defines the states for work items that appear on
      your backlog. Each state must exist in at least one of the work item types
      belong to category defined in: TaskWorkItems. The following state does not
      exist in any of the work item types: In Test.
       
      I had added a custom field to Bugs a while back called 'SubState'.  This
      allows a developer/tester to say that this bug is 'Not Yet Looked At' or
      'Being Investigated' or 'In Code Review' or 'In Test'.   


      I am trying the process of adding RDLs one at a time and then fixing the
      connection string.. but it seems very odd to me (and extremely fragile)
      that the existence of a new field should break reports which don't ever
      look at that field.

      I was able to upload each report and use the web interface to update the
      data sources for the entire report instead of having to do each data set. 
      Not too bad.
