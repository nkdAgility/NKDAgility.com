    the wording used as part of Scrum. There has bee a move away from commitment
    towards forecasting what will be completed. Why is this happening and what
    does it mean to my team? </p><br clear="all"/> <hr />  <p>There has long
    been a subtle lack of transparency between the Product Owner and the
    Development Team that has largely gone unnoticed. In the empirical world
    that is Software Development it is <b>not possible to commit to delivering
    anything</b>! This is reminiscence of the institutional fiction that we can
    indeed give someone a guaranteed delivery date for something that exists in
    the complex world and thus is impossible for us to estimate. We have been
    doing it for years and we are still doing it even in Agile. The only saving
    grace is that our commitment has been for such a small amount of work that
    we are routinely forgiven and indeed any good Product Owner quickly learns
    that <b>Commitment</b> is really a <b>guess</b> and can often be a <b>WAG
    (Wild Assed Guess)</b> at best. </p> <p><a

    <p>Where are these points in Scrum where <b>commitment</b> has been applied:
    </p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Daily Scrum</b></p> <p>During the daily Scrum the
    Development Team get together to review each others previous days commitment
    and then commit to each other to completing work.</p> </li><li> <p><b>Sprint
    Planning</b></p> <p>During Sprint Planning the Development Team commit to
    delivering work to the Product Owner at the end of the Sprint.</p></li></ul>
    <p>There are also a number of other commitment points that are implied in
    Scrum. The Product Owner is probably committing to delivering functionality
    to the Stakeholders (The Business) and often the Business will then commit
    to delivering functionality to their Customer.&nbsp; </p><p>And this is
    where the major problem lies as there are escalating cycles of impact at all
    levels.  <ul> <li> <p>An Individual fails in their commitment to the
    Development Team </p> </li><li> <p>A Development Team fails in its
    commitment to the Product Owner </p> </li><li> <p>A Product Owner fails in
    their commitment to the Business </p> </li><li> <p>The Business fails in its
    commitment to its Customers</p></li></ul> </p><p>If you have "commitment"
    then others will read that as something that can be relied on and
    potentiality take a dependency on the timely completion of that work. Once a
    dependency is taken then it can be a BIG problem if things go south. What if
    your Sales teams have made commitments to old customers to get them to say
    and to new customers to get them to change to you? </p> <p>This is the
    result of <b><i>committing </i></b>to delivering work, so I say again: </p>
    <h3>Can you really commit to delivering work?</h3> <p>The word "Commitment"
    smacks too much of the <b>Prescriptive </b>world and not enough of the
    <b>Predictive</b>. Can we stop diluting a perfectly prescriptive word? Is
    there a better choice that lives in the Predictive world? </p> <p><a

    10 day forecast?</b> </p> <p>The new Scrum Guide talks about <b>Forecast
    </b>instead of the <b>Commitment</b>. This is a subtle and carefully chosen
    contrast that is intended to result in a more positive open and transparent
    communication between the key actors in the pantomime that has been Software
    Development. </p> <p><a

    that change we really start thinking in the Agile / Predictive space and
    some of the old ways will drop by the wayside. Those old ways are the things
    that get in the way of an Agile adoption, that make us want to drop back
    into our old comfortable bad habits of Waterfall.</p> <p><strong>Are you
    going to make the change from Commitment to Forecast?</strong></p> <p>If
    not, let me know why this will not make sense in your organisation!</p>

    comment_content: "The benefit of commitment, in the traditional, non-\"forecast\" sense, was that it created a sense of urgency from the timebox. \_This is one of the big strengths of timeboxing -- there is an urgency to complete a set amount of work in a set amount of time. \_I suspect, that even with a forecast, there will still be a substantial amount of pressure self-applied by the team if it looks like they will miss their forecast. \_However, I don't want to lose one of the very few benefits \"push\" has over \"pull\" -- the sense of urgency. \_One relatively common struggle immature Kanban teams have is the lack of urgency that comes from the lack of urgency from the timebox. \_I'd hate to see Scrum move so close to Kanban that it loses some of the things that make it so powerfully unique. \_I've always thought of the \"little push\" inside a sprint enveloped by the \"bigger pull\" of items from the backlog was a uniquely powerful Scrum-ism. \_Not saying it's gone with the move from Commitment to Forecast, just saying that it gives me pause. \_I'll have to consider it more deeply before I decide if this is an unvarnished good, or if there will be something lost."

      I fully expect that your fears are unfounded. Although there is an
      adequate 

      dictionary definition of Forecast, the dictionary definition is largely
      meaningless when it comes to the 

      feelings and preconceptions that arise in peoples brains when a particular
      word 

      is used. Commitment invokes a sureness that is just not realistic.


      I was teaching the PSM today and my students included four Project
      Managers 

      and one product Owner who all agreed that the word "Commit" is inherently 

      dishonest  and inaccurate as we don’t commit to completing PBI’s within a 

      Sprint, we only commit to try. 


      It is a good change, and if David will forgive me:


      "Development Teams do not commit to completing the work planned during a 

      Sprint Planning Meeting. The Development Team forecasts the work it
      believes 

      will be done, and that forecast changes as more becomes known throughout
      the 

      Sprint. To do otherwise is to ignore the cone of uncertainty at play
      during a 

      Sprint."
