  - "<p>Now, I have, up until now, not had any experience with proxy servers. Well, to be honest, I still don't... But I do have some experience with IIS as I have been using it since the sad old days of NT4. Yes that's right, before Active Directory, The bad old days when domains were the work of a craftsman.</p>\n<p>Anyhoo, my brother\_<a title=\"David Hinshelwood's Profile\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b\">David</a>\_called with a little problem with .pac files for a proxy server. My first though was that I did not know a dam thing about proxy servers, except that annoying \"Access Denied\" message you get when you try to go to the one URL that has the exact answer to the problem you have been trying to solve for hours... Well that's not exactly true, I know what a a proxy server does in theory and what a .pac file does, I have just never used one..</p>\n<p><a title=\"David Hinshelwood's Profile\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/559/67b\">David</a> had two problems, well three if you count the network security guru bit. </p>\n<p>The first reared its ugly head when he tried to access\_a .pac file from IIS. 404! WTF! He could see the file, but no download. Change it to a .txt and there it is. It\_seams that <a title=\"IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb%3bEN-US%3bq258141\">IIS 6.0 does not serve unknown MIME types</a>, unlike previous versions. Adding the MIME type solved the problem: David did actually get this far, he just entered an incorrect MIME Type that he found on the web. </p>\n<p>Inaccurate information on the web! Never... ;)</p>\n<p>The second problem was that he was using a proxy server that was an appliance (i.e. a hardware box that probably said something like \"Cisco proxy magic\" on it) and it did not support host files. He needed a domain to resolve to something other than the IP stated on the web. As I have had some ups and downs with\_ Active Directory I had had this problem, among others, before. What he needs to do is add the domain he wants to repoint (say google.co.uk) to the DNS server and enter the IP address that he wants it to resolve to. Now when an internal request for that domain reaches the DNS server it is handled internally instead of being forwarded to the big cloud.</p>\n<p>So all problems solved, well theoretically... David still need to try them out side of my little home lab.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Misc\" rel=\"tag\">Misc</a>\_</div>"

      Martin was a great help in figuring out where the problems lay. For the
      .pac file to download I needed to add the MIME type
      application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig to the completer properties in IIS. In
      the lab this had immediate effect and I could download the .pac file by
      browsing to the URL but in the live environment it would not work. I went
      home in disgust, worrying about the next step. In the morning it worked
      without any further changes… patience is a virtue it seems. 

      <br>

      <br>For the host file issue – not possible to configure one on the
      Bluecoat appliance – I decided to try to avoid creating a DNS domain for
      the URL I wanted to resolve as a specific IP. If all the configuration is
      kept on the proxy, troubleshooting is simplified and involves one support
      group. forums.bluecoat.com had the answer, use forwarding rules, but… not
      how to do it. After a lot of swearing I discovered you need to set a
      forwarder server with the IP address you want resolved and then set a
      forwarding rule in the policy with a destination of the URL and an action
      to use the forwarder. This will mimic one line of a host file. However,
      this will all be very boring unless you are interested in BluecoatSG web
      proxies.

      <br>

      <br>So, thank you to Martin for solving my .pac file problem and providing
      me with a fallback for the pseudo host file. As he knows, I go to him for
      everything Microsoft or server related. Cheers big ears.

      Just wanted to add my thanks for resolving this.  Quite an oversight on
      MS' part, I think.
