    <p>There is nothing in the Scrum Guide that says that you can't have
    workflow across the Sprint boundary. I'm going to suggest that not only can
    you, but you should as long as you don't endanger the Sprint Goal.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><b>UPDATE: To find out how to allow work to flow across the Sprint
    boundary you can read the </b><b><a
    href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/kanban-guide-scrum-teams">Kanban Guide
    for Scrum Teams</a></b><b>, and schedule a </b><b><a

    Scrum with Kanban</a></b><b> class.</b></p>

    <h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/getting-started-definition-done-dod/">definition
    of Done</a> is an instrumental part of maintaining Transparency of the past
    work and is not optional. The Sprint Goal provides focus and direction. In
    order to maintain flow we need to be able to reduce the batch size of the
    work, thus we must allow for work to flow across the Sprint boundary. If you
    have a Professional Scrum Team that is adept at creating <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-scrum-teams-build-software-works/">Done
    increments of working software</a> then introducing flow can improve the
    value delivered by increasing the throughput of the team.</p>

    alt="" width="800" height="390"/></h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Always remember that the Sprint is a container for Planning and not
    always for Delivery. Just like you can do Continuous Delivery in Scrum, so
    you can also introduce flow and Kanban. Less skilled teams can also benefit
    as long as you make sure that you meet the Sprint Goal and Done Increments
    are created to provide transparency of the past and build trust for the
    future.</p>

    Work that the Development Team knows that it can't finish</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Although you will not find anything in the Scrum Guide that prevents you
    from flowing work across Sprints you should consider it an advanced
    technique. Most teams that I work with are not even at the point where they
    have Working Software at the end of the Sprint and they are often only just
    achieving their Sprint Goal.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I also believed the myth that we could not flow work across the Sprint
    boundary. It took a long conversation with Steve and Daniel to kindle a
    different idea, and long discussions over a beer to make it concrete. My
    argument went; "If you have to be Done by the end of the Sprint then how can
    you have any unfinished work?" My argument was wrong! I was confusing the
    need to have a Done Increment with all of the PBI's being finished.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you as a Development Team are practising Continuous Delivery (CD) then
    they always have working software. I would expect that a team doing CD would
    have every single element of their Definition of Done (DOD) automated and
    every Checkin/Pull Request meets the DOD. If that's true, then when you get
    to your Sprint Review you just show the work that you have finished.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><b>If you want Flow then </b><b><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/continuous-deliver-sprint/">CD is no longer
    optional for a Software Team let along a Professional Scrum
    Team</a></b><b>.</b></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2
    id="h-shipping-software-with-unfinished-work-can-still-be-scrum">Shipping
    software with Unfinished work can still be Scrum</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>There are a number of Engineering consideration that a Development Team
    will need to take into account if they want to focus on Flow. With CD comes
    the need to validate early and often, with automation, so that you don’t
    have to stop and check everything manually. There are a number of practices
    that can help:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><b>Feature Flags</b> - Often referred to as Feature Toggles this is
    a way to insert a switch into the code so that something is visible or not
    to the customer based on a switch. Advanced toggles might support
    "controlled Exposure" to customers, as well as A/B testing, and other
    features. Regardless it is generally accepted that you can't leave all of
    your toggles in the code indefinitely. Once you have completed the PBI /
    Feature or tested your hypothesis you need to remove the flag through
    Refactoring.</li><li><b>Refactoring</b> - The act of restructuring or
    rewriting code for clarity of purpose and future maintenance. One would
    never write a book or article and then just published it. You would normally
    do your first pass… re-read it and update for clarity. Maybe get someone
    else to take a look, and incorporate feedback. Same for
    code…</li><li><b>Test Driven Development (TDD)</b> - Part of the general
    Test First movement TDD allows an engineer to prove that the code that they
    wrote fulfils some pre-defined purpose. It’s the only way that a coder can
    prove that code does at least what they intended. This practice also
    supports refactoring since I can continue to prove that the code after I
    change it, does what was originally intended.</li><li><b>Many
    more</b>…</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>All of these are optional complementary practices that help you achieve
    CD but it is not an exhaustive list. There are many other practices that
    will help, try them and see what works for your team.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>While the Scrum Guide does not say that you need to do CD let alone the
    practices I have listed above, it does require that you create an Increment
    of Working Software at least once per Sprint. Anything less and you have no
    transparency of what was done. With no transparency, you lose your empirical
    process control, and without empiricism, you are not doing Scrum.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><b>Unfinished Backlog Items are not the same as Undone work.</b></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2 id="h-how-does-this-impact-scrum-elements">How does this impact Scrum
    elements?</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Within the bounds of the Scrum Framework, you are allowed to flow work
    from one Sprint to another. The Result is still Scrum if we have working
    software, and we meet the Sprint Goal.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><b>Sprint Review</b> - the purpose of the Sprint Review is to
    inspect what was just created, review and analysis it, and update the
    Product Backlog to be an accurate reflection of future work based on this
    new Increment. At the Sprint Review, we show the work that was completed and
    discuss what was not completed. It's not a failure if the team did not
    finish something, software development is complex and that will happen,
    often. As long as we have an Increment of Done work we have fulfilled our
    obligation to Empirical process control.</li><li><b>Sprint Planning</b> -
    The purpose of the Sprint Planning event is to inspect the Product Backlog
    and create a Sprint Goal, Forecast, and Sprint Backlog for this Sprint.
    Nothing prevents Stories flowing over into the next Sprint unless it
    prevents the team cresting a Done Increment, or endangers the Sprint
    Goal.</li><li><b>Sprint Goal</b> - The Sprint Goal provides purpose and
    direction for the team. And that does not mean that we can't have work
    outside that Sprint Goal inside of the Sprint. We may have production
    issues, leftover work, or just something super important to the Product
    Owner that turns up. As long as the team believes that they can achieve the
    Sprint Goal they can take on any additional work that makes sense.</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I have found that reading the Scrum Guide carefully, turns up all sorts
    of miss conceptions that we all have as we interpret and use Scrum. If you
    are not sure, re-read the Scrum Guide, maintain the Scrum Values, focus on
    empirical process control and maintain transparency.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>At the end of every Sprint, you should have working Software that meets
    your definition of Done and you should have met your Sprint Goal.</p>

      "you should consider it an advanced technique" - Indeed.


      I do have concerns that this will be like taking a highly technical and
      potentially dangerous chemistry experiment being done by post-doctoral
      scientists in a controlled environment, and encouraging middle-school
      students to try it without supervision.

      Be careful and make sure that the team don't use it as an excuse not to
      crate working software and meet their Sprint Goal.
