    <p>Gathering the metrics for Evidence-based Management in software
    organisations can be a strenuous task and I have a number of customers that
    are fretting on what to collect and from where. Here I try to create an
    understanding of the 'what' that we need to collect.</p>

    <p><a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Updated to reflect
    the 2020 Scrum Guide!</a></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Evidence-based Management for Software Organisations is a framework from
    Scrum.org to help organisations focus their efforts on most valuable
    improvements and monitor their effect on the organisation. In my experience,
    organisations recognize agility as a means to improve their value, yet tend
    to lack focus and commitment to moving towards it. This is mostly because of
    entrenched traditional ideas and a resistance to change that comes, in the
    west, from an "if it ain’t broke, don't fix it" mentality. Let's forget for
    a moment that it has been proven over and over again that small experiments
    that fail quickly are what produce results. Let's forget as well the 20
    years of the success of agility when there is focus and courage. We need
    evidence…</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>That evidence is there. You can find study after study that shows that
    agile practices work, that moving to agile values works better. So why don’t
    people listen? Still, I hear: "That will not work here", especially in the
    enterprise. In the successful enterprise its worse: "We are fantastic and we
    know best as we have been doing it this way for many years with success".
    Unfortunately, the measure of success has traditionally been:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>delivered on time</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>delivered on budget</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>with the features that were required upfront</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>This measure of success does not take into account how much 'value' is
    delivered to the customer or users. If you take another look, as the
    Standish Group in Boston has, at the above traditional measures of success
    (used both by PMI and Prince2) you find that this measure equates to very
    little value to the customers. Forrester is currently trying to encourage
    the organisation to start measuring the value that they are delivering
    rather than how they are delivering it.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>How we measure value up until now in software delivery has been to either
    rely on the Product Owner, or to start introducing traditional measures from
    formal process… and we already know where that leads. The dark side!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>So what can we measure? Sure Scrum has traditionally focused on the team,
    and the best measure for a team is "Remaining Work". From that we can create
    Velocity and Burndown to help the Product Owner plan and the Development
    Team deliver. Simple… but organisations are not simple and need a way to
    really measure success in an agile fashion. If we can provide organisations
    with some standard agile metrics maybe, just maybe, we can pull them out of
    the dark and into the light.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>This is why, with all the kafuffle over "scaling Scrum", Scrum.org has
    been biding its time and doing its research. Most of the scaling Scrum
    methodologies out there miss the boat on measurements. Not only that they
    have [come under much fire recently] for providing way too much rigor in the
    wrong places for a "one size fits all" solution. If you can't have "one size
    fits all" at the team level you sure can't do it at the organisational
    one…</p>

    <p>Evidence-based Management for Software Organisations (n):&nbsp; A process
    for measuring, diagnosing and improving the value an organization derives
    from its software investments. It improves an organization's ability to
    compete on its software capabilities by using evidence to focus investments
    on areas that will create the highest value for the entire organization. Its
    iterative, incremental approach to guided change helps organizations control
    the risk of disruption.</p>

    <p>You can find out more from <a
    href="/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/">The
    Evidence-Based Management Guide: Measuring Value to Enable Improvement</a>
    and I want to talk a little more about the gathering of metrics for
    monitoring.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Let's face it, it's not just Organisations that want to understand their
    return on investment for their hard earned cash spent on improving their
    process and practices. There are good consultants out there that want to
    understand the value that they are bringing to their customers so they can
    inspect and adapt as well. I, for one, want to focus on delighting my
    customers. To bringing them the most value for what they pay me. I have
    traditionally done this by simply looking at how happy my customers are.
    While this is an important metric is only one piece of information in a web
    of interconnected data that I can use as evidence of that improvement.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>That is why I went to Boston last month to complete the training and
    assessment to become an Evidence-based Management Consultant with Scrum.org.
    I need to understand how my advice affects an organisation that I am working
    with. How else can I know if my advice is good? Guesswork? That sounds a
    little…archaic. There is a better way…</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>There are really three groups of metrics that make sense at the
    organisational level. There are metrics that monitor the <strong>current
    value</strong> being delivered, the <strong>time to market</strong> and your
    organisations <strong>ability to innovate</strong>. We need to gather these
    metrics at a point in time as soon as possible to provide a baseline for
    where the organisation currently is. We can then reassess the organisation
    at intervals, probably no more than quarterly, which will allow us to look
    at the trends over time.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading
    {"level":3,"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <h3 id="h-current-value-metrics">Current Value Metrics</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The current value metrics look at data that gives an indication of the
    company’s success in the market place. These metrics should be gathered once
    across the organisation with the organisation defined as consistently as
    possible across instances. They might include:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Revenue per Employee</strong> – Gather the revenue generated by
    the product you are evaluating and employees contributing to its
    success</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Cost of Product Domains </strong>– Gather the IT expenses
    associated with the product</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Employee Satisfaction</strong> – what percentage of employees
    are engaged?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Customer satisfaction</strong> – what percentage of your
    customers is marketing your products or services on your behalf?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>All of these are easy to collect and most are likely readily available.
    Many enterprises already do some form of employee and customer satisfaction
    which we may be able to use. However the timespan of the collection of the
    metrics should ideally match.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading
    {"level":3,"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <h3 id="h-time-to-market-metrics">Time-to-Market Metrics</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>These metrics look at how quickly an organisation is able to bring new
    innovations to its customers. They might include:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Release frequency</strong> – How often do we put new features in
    the hands of our customers?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Release stabilisation</strong> – How much time are we spending
    on getting something “done” to “really done”?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Cycle time</strong> – How long does it take for us to move new
    features from idea into customer’s hands?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:heading
    {"level":3,"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <h3 id="h-ability-to-innovate-metrics">Ability to Innovate Metrics</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>These metrics look at an organisation’s ability to continue bringing
    innovations to its customers in the future. They might include:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Installed Version Index</strong> - What percentage of your
    customers are able to take advantage of new features on the latest release
    of your product?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Usage Index</strong> – What percentage of our features does not
    provide value to our customers?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Innovation Rate</strong> – What percentage of our budget is
    spent on innovation?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Defects</strong> – How much technical debt are we
    accumulating?</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>As you have already likely surmised with these metrics it makes sense to
    gather them per application. We can then average the results to figure what
    they are across the entire spectrum. While these figures may vary wildly
    between applications as long as you use the same formula you should get
    comparable results.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Scrum.org suggests aggregating these into one, easy to track metric – the
    Agility Index. This number becomes synonymous with the value an organization
    is getting from its software development capabilities.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>For the first time we can now, as consultants, monitor the improvements
    we are making in organisations. Even better, organisations can use these
    metrics to demonstrate the value that their investments in agility with
    training and consulting are bringing them. This is a fabulous step forward
    in our understanding of software delivery. An easy, simple way of measuring
    our progress towards process improvement.</p>
