Microsoft Test Manager (MTM), AKA Test Professional, is a new testing system that team can use to create manual and Automation test quickly. The real advantage and strength of MTM is the integration with TFS and Visual Studio 2010 and how it can leverage the ALM tools and practices. In the demo, we show:

1. Explain the architecture of MTM
2. Setup a Manual test run
3. Show how to configure the environment, build and other conditions for a test
4. How MTM is completely integrated into TFS and VS 2010
5. How we can gather real-time test data that we can provide back to teams or person
