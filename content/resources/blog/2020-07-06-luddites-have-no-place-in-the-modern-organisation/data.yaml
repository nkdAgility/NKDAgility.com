    <p>In our <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-agile-leadership-essentials-training/">Professional
    Agile Leadership training</a>, we talk about changing your organisations
    hiring practices to hire more of the right sort of people to create the
    company that you want, not the company that you have.  Hire the right people
    also implies that you will have to, within your cultural constraints,
    de-hire the wrong people.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><h5>Luddite</h5><h5><p><strong>"a person
    opposed to new technology or ways of working."</strong></p><p><small><em>"a
    small-minded Luddite resisting progress" ·&nbsp;"I'm not a Luddite, after
    all I work with the internet for my job"</em></small></p></h5></blockquote>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>One of the reasons that your organisation is the way that it is, and that
    it is so hard to change, is its culture. The culture of an organisation is
    just a reflection of people that make up the organisation and the way that
    they do things. </p>

    <p>As you transition from the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/the-tyranny-of-taylorism/">traditional
    tayloristic model</a> of departments and hierarchy to an empirical model of
    cross-functional delivery teams that suits the modern world of business you
    need to make sure that you have the right people or you will encounter
    friction at every turn. You may even find that some folks try to actively
    undermine the change. </p>

    <p>As you move down your chosen <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/agile-evolution">agile evolutionary</a>
    path there are many common changes that you will make, but there is a reason
    I use the phrase Evolution and not Transformation. An agile business is one
    that can adapt to changing circumstances effectively, quickly, and without
    panic, as the world changed around them. </p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Microsoft is the poster-child of what can be accomplished with the
    judicious application of leadership. With the servent-leadership and
    strategic vision of <strong>Satya Nadella,</strong> it has <a
    href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/10/27/surprise-microsoft-is-agile/"
    target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer

    (2010) towards independent delivery teams</a> of today.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you go into Microsoft today and ask them what has changed since they
    were a traditional organisation, they will say "everything"! The list above
    is a point-in-time snapshot taken in 2017 from their evolution. Most things
    on that list have changed since then.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The world operates at a much higher frequency than it ever did before and
    a <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/bureaucracy-is-the-enemy-of-agility/">lack
    of learning, innovation, and evolution of our processes, practices, and
    tools</a> is the realm of the Luddite.</p>

      <p>To learn and adapt together it is important that all relevant levels of
      the organisation participate in the same training, as the realisations are
      profound. All organisations are different in terms of which ways of
      working are effective for them. Our training will help your people explore
      those options in an environment within which it is safe to fail.</p>

      create a hypothesis for experimental learning and measures to gauge
      success. We aim to help organisations learn, evolve, and adapt so that
      they can continuously improve independently and no longer need external
      training and coaching.</p>
