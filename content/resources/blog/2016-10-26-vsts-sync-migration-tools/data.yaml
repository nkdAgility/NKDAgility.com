    <p>I have been working with a number of customers in the last year that want
    to move to VSTS. While many of them want to do the full Collection import,
    many do not.  </p><p><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;
    background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:
    0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/image_thumb.png"
    width="1024" height="606"/></a>  </p><p>Maybe they have too many Team
    Projects and they want to consolidate, maybe they just have too much
    baggage. Whatever the reason I needed to be able to push data around between
    TFS and VSTS… or even TFS to TFS. That is when the <a
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.vsts-sync-migration">VSTS
    Sync Migration tools</a> were born.  </p><p>I initially had but a single
    goal of migrating work items, but since then it has broadened out to include
    many different types of data:  <ul> <li> <p><strong>Work Items</strong> - I
    only ever worry about the Tip of Work Item tracking. Apart from the History
    (comments) field which I do migrate there is really no long term value in it
    aside from reporting. Since most migration tool mess up the dates the
    reporting value disappears as does the value in the history.</p>
    <p><small>Note: I do have some ideas around this and the new API
    capabilities since TFS 2012 should allow a higher fidelity of data
    migration, however I have not yet been unable to talk a customer out of
    History, and thus I have not had the need to build. So if you want to
    migrate with history and have the budget…</small></p> </li><li>
    <p><strong>Test Plans &amp; Suits</strong> - The Test data is a lot
    trickier, but I managed to get Configurations, Variables, as well as Plans
    and Suits migrated. There are still some bugs but its way better than having
    to go make everything from scratch.</p> <p><small>Note: Test Runs are not
    currently migrated but I have been noodling on that problem. Again, once
    someone is desperate enough to give me a reason to go dive in…</small></p>
    </li><li> <p><strong>Teams </strong>- Really simple, just the team names,
    but there is scope for a lot more. </p> </li><li> <p>Area &amp; Iteration
    Paths - Simply replicated the existing layout. I would love to have all of
    the Team Meta data but again, time…</p></li></ul> </p><p>Since most teams
    migrate from TFVC to Git in TFS I was not interested in migrating code.
    There are some really good solutions for that already with Git-TF and
    Git-TFS being the best. I wanted the tools to be free as well, so while I
    always work in VSTS I publish the code and releases out to GitHub so others
    can participate.  </p><p>You are welcome to Fork the repository on GitHub
    and I will happily accept pull requests, but know that my MASTER is in VSTS
    and not GitHub along with the entire automated build and release system. I
    release to <a
    href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/VSTS.DataBulkEditor.Engine/">NuGet</a>,
    <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator">Chocolatey</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migration">GitHub</a>, and
    the <a
    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.vsts-sync-migration">VSTS
    Marketplace</a>.  </p><p>Let me know what you think of the tools…</p>
  - >-
    <p>VSTS Sync Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit data in TFS &amp; VSTS.
    You can bulk edit work items in place, or even migrate Teams, Backlogs,
    Tasks, Test Cases, and Plans &amp; Suits to a new TFS or VSTS project.</p>

      Have you talked to MS / Brian Harry about their high fidelity import tool?
      apparently they're trialing it

      Which is why I mentioned "While many of them want to do the full
      Collection import, many do not." Many customers want to Merge/Split Team
      Projects, or just move one. Can't do that with the high fidelity iImport.
      But yes, I go there first!

      Great post. This is tooling that will be appropriate for many :)


      You state (with respect to WI history) "there is really no long term value
      in it", which is likely true for the majority. But there are teams which
      do statistical analysis directly off the work item store (not
      warehouse/cube) for which this is a consideration.

      Agreed, which is why I said "long term value". Once you get 6 months of
      new history under your belt the older history is meaningless. For
      iterative teams that period is probably only 3 or so iterations of
      history...


      Is it worth spending the money it would take to do a full history
      migration for 6-9 weeks of value?

      I have one client who was an early adopter of TFS in 2005 or 06.... They
      are a manufacturing firm, and use the system for throughput tracking
      across the factory...Not just software...


      They do month over month, as well as quarter over quarter, year over
      years, along with 3 year and 5 years trends.


      As a product makes it through the production line, the area path for that
      lot is changed, the period of time in each area is what they need to
      analyze...


      This is why (though I agree with you in the general case), using absolute
      statement is almost always going to miss real world situations and
      use-cases.

      Martin - Thank you for the tool.  I am getting issues when trying to run
      with not able to update Created Date.  Is this something I should submit
      as issue or is this a documentation issue with permissions required.  I
      was trying first to copy from on TFS Project Collection to a new one to do
      some clean up first.  I also ran into an issue when directly trying to
      upload to VSTS due to throttle limits.  I have about 1500 work items to
      migrate.  Customer wants historical data migrated and it includes work
      item links and some include attachments.   I am willing to submit issue on
      GitHub if that is what is appropriate.  Again thanks.
