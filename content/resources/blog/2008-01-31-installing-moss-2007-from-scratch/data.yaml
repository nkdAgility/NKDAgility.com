  - "<p>I am having occasion to rebuild my Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) development server. In fact, I killed it by adding a Business Data Catalog (BDC) that pointed to a table that had just over a million rows... Now, maybe this would not have caused a problem if I was not using a single server deployment with SQL server on the same box...</p> <p>That's the way the OS crumbles <img alt=\"smile_regular\" src=\"http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif\" /></p> <p>Anyway, I am installing from a blank VM helpfully provided by our Infrastructure team. The plan is to install all updates before installing MOSS, this includes .NET 3.5 as some of the applications I will be putting on the server will be using it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_2.png\"><img style=\"border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px\" height=\"182\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb.png\" width=\"796\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>If you just try and run the MOSS install you get a nice little message detailing what you need to install as pre-requisites. I have my .NET 3.5 install running, so that should take care of all but IIS...</p> <h2>Install SQL</h2> <p>You will need SQL Server installed. As this is a development box and I don't have any licensing consideration for development environments under our enterprise agreement I am using \"Developer Edition\" which is identical to \"Enterprise Edition\" of SQL Server. And I am not using a default instance. I will soon be in the possession of a SQL Server 2005 Cluster and all of my systems. SharePoint and <a title=\"Team Foundation Server\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">TFS</a> will have their databases moved onto that server.</p> <p>Now, due to the security requirements of these systems (TFS required DBO and SharePoint required DBCreator) Each one will have its own instance.</p> <p>TFS is easy enough to move between servers, but SharePoint is NOT. It would require a full backup (from within SharePoint) and restore to move the databases. But I have a plan.. the <a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/31/the-sharepoint-plan-database-move-headache-mitigation.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">The SharePoint Plan: Database move headache mitigation</a>, but I have know idea wither it will work.</p> <p>Anyway, since my SQL Server install is finished...back to the SharePoint install..</p> <h2>Install Microsoft Office SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition</h2> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_4.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"206\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>Make sure that you keep your product key safe, as I have lost mine again... <img alt=\"smile_cry\" src=\"http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_cry.gif\" /></p> <p>Thank goodness for MSDN...</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_6.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"206\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_2.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>At the end of the install you get prompted to open the Configuration pages. Well, I'm not.. I am going to get a \"VM Snapshot\" taken of the server at this point. That should allow me to get back to this point at any time...</p> <p>As Service Pack 1 is now available for SharePoint I want to start with SP1. So the next step is to install WSS 3.0 SP1 and then MOS SP1.</p> <h2>Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1</h2> <p>Hopefully if I install SP1 at this time I will not run into all the problems I (and a lot of other people) had <a title=\"Installing Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1)\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/12/13/installing-windows-sharepoint-services-3.0-service-pack-1-sp1.aspx\">last time</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_8.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"209\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_3.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>Aw, crap.. Running the install automatically ran the Configuration Wizard, which I did not want to do at this time. Well looks like I have to..</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_10.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"209\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-InstallingMOSSfromscratch_7DCD-image_thumb_4.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>All is good for the new Database setup and it seams to be running through the tasks of pointing the SharePoint installation at the DNS database name. I really do hope that it allows me to change the database location without messing around with SharePoint backups.</p> <p>And that's the WSS 3.0 SP1 update on successfully, and with no errors...</p> <h2>Installing Microsoft Office System Server Service Pack 1</h2> <p>OK, I now have high hopes for this installation as well.
