  - "<p>I came across this amazing new service which is very similar to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.clustermaps.com/\">ClusterMaps</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neoworx.net/\">NeoWORX</a>. It is a bit of a pain in Flash as the system resources required for flash these days seams a little excessive, but I would like to see it running as a WPF XBAP. </p>\n<!-- NeoPlanet by NeoWORX ... START of code -->\n\n\n\n<!-- NeoPlanet by NeoWORX ... END of code -->\n<p>In fact I would go as far as to say, that would be something my company would pay money for. You see we have generators in service and at depots all over the world. that is our Fleet if you will, and our board members would eat up this kind of thing. If we could pass it some geographical data and plot all of our generators and coolers around the world in real time it would be a fantastic data presentation tool for the board.</p>\n<p>I think that the globe above , while cool, is a wee bit to gimmicky for that purpose, but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neoworx.net/blue/neoearth_page.php\">NeoEarth</a> feature would better suit our needs...</p>\n<p>All it needs is for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.neoworx.net/\">NeoWORX</a> to provide some sort of SDK with a local install of the engine for corporate customers to send their application any Geo tagged data :) With, hopefully, the ability to control what appears in the popup's :)</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/WPF\" rel=\"tag\">WPF</a>\_</div>"

      Hi... thanks for using ClustrMaps (note the spelling!)...  as proof of our
      interest in what our users think and say, we've not only spotted your blog
      posting, but also we've just upgraded you to ClustrMaps+ (no ads, better
      zoomed in maps), and would be curious as to what you think in a straight
      head-to-head comparison with NeoWorx.<br /><br />No strings attached...
      i.e. the free upgrade stands, even if you write a negative review.  More
      significantly, please email us directly regarding your SDK comment: our
      forthcoming ClustrMaps Pro is exactly for that sort of thing!<br /><br
      />All the best, and thanks for sticking with us.<br /><br />-CJ on behalf
      of the ClustrMaps Team
