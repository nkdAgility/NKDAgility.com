    width="145" height="48" />As Lead developer for the TFS Iteration Automation
    my goal this weekend is to provide a framework for the developers to give
    both architectural and development guidance for the tools and methods we are
    going to be using to construct the Platform.</p>  <br clear="all" />  <hr
    />  <p>I have been working on a framework that will allow the developers to
    get started building for the TFS Automation Platform and specifically to
    meet the goals for Release 1. I should note that I am not writing any code
    at this time I am putting together the jigsaw and selecting some
    technologies.</p>  <p>I have gone with two solutions. One to constrain all
    of the platform bits and another for the Automation that we will be
    building. The main reason for this is to dogfood the developer experience as
    we really want folks to start building Automations in the wild. If it is
    hard in any way then they will not.</p>  <p>This method also allows us to
    both version and release the Automations separately from the platform and
    reduces our dependency on code changes in the core. The idea is that, just
    as everyone else will be doing, we build the Automations against the latest
    “released” bits. In our case, that will mean the latest “alfa” at the start,
    but needs must.</p>  <h2>TfsAutomationPlatform</h2>  <p>While I intend to
    keep the Automation Platform as simple as possible, that does not mean that
    it actually is simple. There are really three parts to the Platform that
    need to be installed separately, but Mike’s help we should be able to have a
    unified installer.</p>  <p>&#160;<a

    width="600" height="341" /></a>    <br /><strong>Figure: The Platform needs
    to be very structured</strong></p>  <p>If you are eagle eyed you will see
    that we are going to be using WIX, Silverlight and the new Architectural
    tooling in Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate. </p>  <h3>Store</h3>  <p>The Store
    is like a big database of assets. In this case the assets are the Plugins
    that are available for TFS Administrators to install on their servers. This
    will be written in Silverlight 5 and can be hosted in IIS or Azure.
    Hopefully we will be providing a hosted version on Azure, but those with
    extreme security concerns may install it locally in IIS.</p>  <p><a

    width="600" height="521" /></a>    <br /><strong>Figure: A simple
    model</strong></p>  <p>Hopefully as we move forward with new versions we can
    implement more to provide a culture and ecosystem around the store, but our
    initial goal is to deliver something that works. Lets worry about gold
    plating later.</p>  <h3>Admin</h3>  <p>This handles all of the grunt work of
    downloading, installing, Deploying, retracting and configuring plugins. Must
    be installed on the Application Tier.</p>  <p><a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/image14.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px;

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/image_thumb14.png"
    width="600" height="436" /></a>    <br /><strong>Figure: Very Similar to the
    Store for now</strong></p>  <p>The Admin section handles all of the magic of
    configuring and auctioning all of the Plugins.&#160; </p> 
    <h3><strong>Client</strong> </h3>  <p>A hook to provide deep Visual Studio
    integration. Is optional, but lets you quickly link thorough to the Admin
    application. Will also provide dynamic Check-In Policies in the future. I am
    not really thinking a lot around this as it will probably not make R1.</p> 
    <h2>TfsAutomationPlugins</h2>  <p>As we will be building a number of OOB
    (Out Of the Box) Automations it makes sense for us to build them as part of
    a single solution. This is just for ease of development and if we do have a
    separation of teams then we may end up with separate solutions. But for now
    it is easier with just one. We will however need to be careful not to
    reference between them as one could be deployed without the other.</p>

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/06/image_thumb15.png"
    width="602" height="180" /></a>     <br /><strong>Figure: Where do the files
    go?</strong></p>  <p>I will be looking more at the Plugins layout later, and
    how you can start building Plugins now. I will be upgrading my <a
    href="http://tfseventhandler.codeplex.com">TFS Event Handler</a> project
    code to this platform soon.</p>  <p>I am trying very hard to make it easy to
    develop for this platform. I don’t think it will be something that anyone
    can do as there will be a learning curve for what goes where, and especially
    how you can debug against TFS in process.</p>  <p>Now that everything is
    checked in, I will be encouraging my team mates to explore the
    solution.</p>  <p><a

    places to put code</strong>    <br /></p>  <p>Let me know what improvements
    you can observe as noting is perfect, especially not if it was done by
    me.</p>
