    <p>I have been an <a href="https://www.scrum.org/ebm-experts"
    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accredited Evidence-based
    Management Expert with Scrum.org</a> for the last 7 years and I have been
    using the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/"
    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evidence-based Management
    Guide</a> to encourage leaders to make decisions based on evidence instead
    of gut feel.</p>

    <p>For lots of reasons that program had been taking a back burner with
    Scrum.org over the years. The main reason is that there is a lot of thought
    and practical evaluation that needs to be done to validate the ideas
    contained within the guide. My fellow <a
    href="https://www.scrum.org/ebm-experts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer
    noopener">EBM Experts</a> and I have been evaluating it with customers big
    and small, from defence to <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/professional-organisational-change-ghana-police-service/">police
    services</a>, and media to <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/professional-scrum-everyone-organisation/">healthcare</a>,
    we have run the numbers, crunched the data and integrated the feedback. It's
    time to announce the latest course in the Agile Leadership series! A one-day
    event, the <span data-provider="custom_post_type|courses|46220"

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I attended one of the first events as well as an
    additional trainer preparation event Scrum.org calls a Virtual Train the
    Trainer (vTTT). I have to say that I loved participating in this class. </p>

    <p>One of the key value propositions is that this call is not there to give
    you metrics that you must use. Instead, we encourage businesses to create
    their own metrics based on your unique context! You need to have metrics but
    we are not arrogant enough to assume that we have the right ones for
    you.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>You would think that we would not have to say to folks that having a
    Vision and Strategic Goal is a necessity for success, but we do. That Vision
    and Strategic Goal need to be communicated to everyone that is working on
    your Product or within your business. Successful organisations do a better
    job than unsuccessful ones at connecting their employees to that Vision and
    Goal, at helping them understand how the work they do every day contributes
    to that vision and goal.</p>

    <p>Time and again I and my colleagues visit companies that either doesn't
    have a vision or have one that is not communicated. Even when there is one,
    and it is communicated the ability for people doing the work to connect to
    that vision is in question. </p>

    <p>Just as the PAL gets you to think about how you lead an organisation, the
    PAL-EBM gets you to think about how you measure your success!</p>
