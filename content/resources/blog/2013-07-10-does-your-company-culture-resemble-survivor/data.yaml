    <p class="lead">Does your company culture resemble Survivor? Do you have a
    culture in your organisation where individuals that help others are
    considered slackers for not getting their own assignments complete?</p>

    <p>If you are trying to achieve agility it is imperative that your team
    members work together to solve problems. I am not saying that you have to do
    pair programming but you have to have a culture where collaboration and
    working together is the norm. This is one of the two main roadblocks to
    agility ( the other one being requirements management) that companies hit
    time and time again early in their agile adoptions.</p>

    <p>Changing this part of your culture is something that has much wider
    implications than just improving your teams ability to deliver value. It is
    a harbinger of changes to come and if you can change this one thing, you
    will be more able, and committed, to making more changes to your culture
    going forward. The goal is to have a culture of change where each of your
    teams are running small low risk experiments in processes, practices and
    tools every iteration. It is the catalyst to wider company adoption and
    buy-in and it requires a certain amount of courage and discipline to
    achieve.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>As with most impediments to the path to agility this is an issue of
    culture. To change culture you need commitment and courage not just from
    those at the coal face but from executive leadership on down. If you are
    trying to adopt agility from the bottom up you will have limited success and
    ultimately you are doomed to failure.</p>

    <p>The problem is in how individuals see their work and treat the work done
    by others. Over many years the US, and in some industries the UK, have moved
    towards the Survivor model. This is where each individual is measured and
    encouraged to look out only for themselves. They work in an isolated bubble
    where they are force fed activities and they are solely responsible for
    activities in their queue and those individuals are often stack ranked each
    year. This process only services to isolate not just individual but also
    their skills and their knowledge.</p>

    <p>Ask yourself this: If you won the lottery and never returned to the
    office what would be the impact?</p>

    <h2>You need to foster unit mentality</h2>

    <p>If you have see the Mel Gibson movie “We were soldiers” there is a really
    memorable phrase that has value in the software space. “Learn the job of the
    man above you, and the man below you”. Software development is a
    collaborative effort of a Unit (Development Team) working together to
    achieve a goal. We need to understand each others knowledge, skills and even
    quirks in order to be effective.</p>

    <p>It is critical to instill a sense of Team and not Individual within your
    organisation. If you are going to get anywhere on the path to agility you
    need to let go of the matrix. You need to realise that allowing team members
    to work on more than one project at a time only creates the illusion that
    there is more work underway. The reality is simple…individuals that switch
    between projects lose at least 20% of their time per project that you
    add.</p>

    <h2>The loss of the 100% worker</h2>

    <p>There is even a greater loss of not working in dedicated Teams; you lose
    most of your peoples individual ability to solve problems. Software
    development is all about problem solving, its about puzzles and developers
    excel at solving them. Remember that software development it is always
    product development. However if you give your Development Team members the
    wrong puzzles you will not be utilising them for the thing that you actually
    employed them for…solving the puzzles.</p>

    <p>Its the background processing power of a developers subconscious that you
    can utilise to solve the most complicated of problems. Developers will
    figure things out in the bath, or while playing with the kids or driving
    home from work. Unfortunately if you give a developer many projects to work
    on and they have to switch often ( you know… to show progress on many things
    at once) then what is the greatest problem in their world? You should have
    guessed it by now: its the problem of juggling their workload. So the
    problem that their subconscious is trying to solve is how to juggle that
    work more effectively.</p>

    <p>This has the effect of stretching the amount of time that each thing
    takes as it takes many more cycles for the developer to figure out the
    problems and thus your software takes many more months to deliver than it
    should.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Don’t have a company culture that resembles Survivor and instead opt for
    one of Teams. These Teams will be a force multiplier to your ability to
    deliver software and this will give you a competitive advantage. Don’t wait
    until your competition figure this out!</p>
