    <p class="lead">Do you know what to do with Areas, Iteration, Teams, Source
    Control, and Security when modelling Teams in Team Foundation Server
    2013?</p> <p>There are a number of things that we need to take into
    consideration when modelling Teams in Team Foundation Server 2013 and
    enabling a method of work that supports all of our activities. Lets say that
    I have a single core product that is then further customised for many
    customers.&nbsp; In this circumstance, I have a number of Projects that are
    run against a single Customer that may have one or more teams. Each of these
    Projects exists on a single branch off of the Production branch for that
    customer and all work on that Project is completed against that branch.</p>
    <h2>Assumptions &amp; Constraints</h2> <p>I want to detail some of the
    constraints and then the solutions within Team Foundation Server. Remember
    that TFS is not purely a source control system and has many moving gears
    that all need to slot into place to get access to the power that it
    provides. That power is represented in the relationships between the
    components that is reflected in the data and reporting that is made
    available.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Project -</strong> Body of work completed in
    a single Branch for a single customer.  </li><li><strong>Team</strong> -
    Group of individuals that completes work  </li><li><strong>Team
    Member</strong> - An individual that works full or part time against one or
    more projects. </li></ul> <h2>Solution for Teams</h2> <p>Teams here will be
    used as both containers for individuals (leaf nodes) and to roll-up the work
    for reporting and management purposes. We may want to order work, plan and
    report for the entire boxy of work, for a single Customer, a single Team or
    even a single Team irrespective of Customer. It just depends on how
    complicated that our organisational structure is.</p> <p><img title="image"
    style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image:
    none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:
    0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0"
    alt="image" src="https://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image25.png"
    width="800" height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Team structure when modelling
    teams</small></p> <p>Here we have for example an “Alfa Team” entity that
    provides a container for planning with a Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Capacity
    Planning and Boards. This allows a Team to focus on the work that has been
    assigned to them more effectively. In addition a Team is a security group
    that can be used to secure any area within the bounds of Team Foundation
    Server. If we want to work outside the bounds of Team Foundation Server then
    we can make an Active Directory group that also represents that entity.</p>
    <p><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px;
    background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left:
    0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px"
    border="0" alt="image" src="http://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image30.png"
    width="800" height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Role-up backlogs for
    modelling teams</small></p> <p>In this example I have created roll-up Teams
    that aggregate both content and functionality&nbsp; so that someone can
    maintain and manage the “Customer 1” backlog above. That “Customer 1”
    backlog will show work from both “Alfa Team”, “Beta Team”, and the
    “Continuing Engineering” Team that exist under Customer 1 only. The owner of
    “Customer 1” will then be able to prioritise the work irrespective of Team
    and have that order reflected in each of the teams individual backlogs. You
    can see that I have added both the customer and team to the PBI title but
    this is only for illustrative purposes.</p> <h2>Solution for Source
    Control</h2> <p>Although there is no requirement for your source control
    model to mirror your Area hierarchy it does make things a little easier to
    understand and to work with.</p> <p><img title="image"
    style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image:
    none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:
    0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0"
    alt="image" src="http://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image27.png"
    width="800" height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Simple source control
    layout</small></p> <p>The layout above reflects the needs of the
    organisation as well as the facilities in TFS. TFS secures folders in the
    same way that Windows folder permissions work and you can change the
    settings at any level.</p> <p><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px;
    border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top:
    0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline;
    padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image31.png" width="800"
    height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Remove Contributor</small></p> <p>The
    first step is to remove Contributor permissions as we are going to give
    explicit access for each Team to the appropriate Project and thus give them
    implicit permission to the Source Code under that project. If you go to the
    web administration section of TFS you can use the Version Control tab to set
    security permission on the Source Control components. Here we are selecting
    the root, Contributors and then setting all permissions to “not set” at this
    level.</p> <p><img title="SNAGHTML40c31" style="border-top: 0px;
    border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top:
    0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline;
    padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="SNAGHTML40c31"
    src="http://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/SNAGHTML40c31.png" width="800"
    height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Giving Teams access to
    Folders</small></p> <p>If you then select the individual Branch folder you
    can then give explicit contributor permission [Check in, Check out, Label,
    Lock, Merge, and Read] for a specific Team. In this case it is the “Alfa
    Team” that we are adding that will give them access and no other teams.</p>
    <h2>Solution for Areas</h2> <p>Areas are used in TFS to compartmentalise
    work items and is used by Teams to identify what bodies of work are shown on
    their dashboards. A Team will own one or more areas and may or may not show
    sub items. This is how we can create hierarchical Teams from a flat
    list.</p> <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px;
    border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px;
    padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px;
    border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://nkdagility.com/files/2013/07/image29.png" width="800"
    height="500"/><br /><small>Figure: Teams under Projects</small></p> <p>We
    may need to represent both work by multiple Teams under a single Project and
    a single Team under multiple Projects. This allows us to get versatility of
    reporting and ease of use for the individuals doing work. To achieve that we
    may have multiple Area paths that represent the same Team but in a different
    context.</p> <h2>Automation</h2> <p>All of the configuration necessary for
    all of the above can be automated and there are only a finite number of
    actions:</p> <ul> <li>Create Customer [Create SC folder, create customer
    team, create area &amp; iteration paths]  </li><li>Create Project (AKA
    Branch) [Create Branch, Create area and iteration path, (optional) create
    team, <i>create builds</i>]  </li><li>Create Team [Create team, create ad
    group]  </li><li>Add Team to Project [Create area path, add path to team,
    Add permission to SC, add permission to area]  </li><li>Add usergroup to
    Team [integrate with AD] </li></ul> <p>Each of these actions has a number of
    identified steps and all steps can be orchestrated using PowerShell. I plan
    on creating a bunch of PowerShell’s for this as customers demand but for now
    these actions can be completed manually.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Creating
    structure in Team Foundation Server 2013 that model not only your
    organisation but your ideal structure within your organisation is what makes
    Team Foundation Server my preferred tool for Application Lifecycle
    Management. These are things that I have been doing in TFS since TFS 205 but
    now the product team have added features that directly provide those
    capabilities.</p> <p>Are you getting the most our of your Team Foundation
    Server deployment?</p>

      Hi,

      It is possible to prevent the Customer 2 team members to see the name of
      the Customer 1 area (not the content)?

      We are using Team's but are having issues with Labels.

      Team members are not able to create labels or find labels created by
      others.

      Any suggestions on how to provide Teams members the ability to perform
      these functions?

      Angela, Are you referring to Source Control? And if so, do you mean to say
      TFVC or Git?

      Yes and it's TFVC.

      I had to give everyone Read access at the  Team Project level, and deny
      Read acess on the directories they should not access. Now they can Find
      Labels.

      Haven't  tested label creation yet.
