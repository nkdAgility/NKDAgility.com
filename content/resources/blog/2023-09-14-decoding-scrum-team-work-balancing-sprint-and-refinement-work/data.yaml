    <p><strong>Software Development</strong> is not just a systematic process
    but a dynamic interplay of critical work that shapes the progress of your
    product. A <strong>Scrum</strong> team's work can be classified into
    <strong>Sprint</strong> work and <strong>Refinement</strong>. To steer your
    <strong>Scrum Team</strong> towards success, it's essential to understand,
    manage, and balance these two types of work. This article dives deep into
    the heart of Scrum team operations, offering clear-cut strategies and
    innovative visualisation techniques to help you understand and manage your
    Sprint work and Refinement processes effectively. Decode the intricacies of
    Scrum teamwork and unlock the path to achieving your product goals with
    increased efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tldr">TLDR;</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This post analyses two types of work a Scrum Team typically undertakes:
    Sprint work and Refinement. <strong>Sprint work</strong> involves changes
    that lead to a tangible alteration in the product increment, while
    <strong>Refinement </strong>consists of activities that substantively alter
    the Product Backlog. Sprint Work adds direct value to the stakeholders,
    while Refinement sets the stage for future Sprint Work. The challenge lies
    in striking a balance between these types of work, ensuring an efficient
    workflow. To visualise this work, the article recommends using platforms
    like <strong>#AzureDevOps</strong> that offer mechanisms for tracking both
    Sprint Work and Refinement, ensuring seamless transparency.&nbsp;</p>

    Sprint Work and Refinement</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Every Scrum Team juggles two kinds of work - Sprint Work and Refinement.
    While they may seem different, they're two sides of the same coin,
    intrinsically tied together.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Sprint Work</strong> involves anything that directly contributes
    to the Sprint Backlog. It could be discovery, development, validation, or
    delivery tasks that significantly change the state of the <strong>Product
    Increment</strong>. This work directly adds value to the stakeholders and
    propels the product forward.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>On the other hand, <strong>Refinement </strong>is the work done against
    the Product Backlog. It could involve ideation, discovery, proofing,
    decomposition, sizing, or other activities that significantly change the
    <strong>Product Backlog</strong>. This is less direct value, but Refinement
    is critical to a Scrum Team's success. It sets the stage for future Sprint
    Work by getting the Backlog Items "ready" for the Scrum Team to bring into
    the Sprint.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Refinement helps prepare for surprises by allowing the Scrum Team space
    to provide prerequisites and other inputs for the Backlog items before they
    are brought into the Sprint. It helps reduce the chance of unforeseen issues
    that could have been avoided. The challenge, however, is to prevent
    over-preparation that leads to unnecessary work â€“ it's all about finding the
    'Goldilocks zone' of balance between too much and too little.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-visualising-refinement">Visualising
    Refinement</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Visualising this work plays a crucial role in keeping track of project
    progress. With its robust mechanisms, Azure DevOps is an excellent tool to
    help visualise without pulling all those backlog items that are not yet
    "ready" into the Sprint.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>To track the refinement work in the Board, create a new column named
    'Refinement' and map it to the "Approved" or "New" state, depending on the
    process used. This column will contain Backlog Items that need to be refined
    to "ready" before they are candidates for the Sprint.&nbsp;</p>

    DevOps Board showing Refining Column with Tasks</figcaption></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>For the Taskboard, change the Iteration Path of the tasks to that of the
    current Sprint, which is the default for new items created within the
    context of a team. This change will display the task on the Taskboard and
    pull a shadow of the Backlog Item in for context for these tasks.</p>

    DevOps Taskboard showing grey PBI not in Sprint with Tasks in
    Sprint.</figcaption></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>These two capabilities are critical to being able to visualise the work
    that is happening while maintaining the separation of the transparencies of
    the Sprint and Product backlogs.</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Understanding and managing the balance between Sprint Work and Refinement
    is critical for a Scrum Team's success. By visualising these tasks
    effectively, your team can plan and execute tasks efficiently, avoiding
    unnecessary work and being prepared for potential roadblocks.&nbsp;</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>By dedicating enough time to Refinement, teams gain a comprehensive
    understanding of what's necessary, preparing them to effectively manage
    upcoming tasks and potential challenges. Therefore, visualising all work in
    progress allows for smoother product management and promotes a thorough
    understanding of the product's needs, fostering more informed, efficient,
    and successful Scrum operations.</p>
