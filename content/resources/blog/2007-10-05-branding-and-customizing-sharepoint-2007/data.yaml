  - "<p>I have been delving into the black art of SharePoint Branding, and I have been finding it a grueling process. Don't get me wrong it is a vast improvement over SharePoint 2003 and I have already built 2 Features (but not for public consumption yet). </p> <p>SharePoint 2007 uses a combination of CSS and master pages to allow the developer to make most of the changes that are required for branding, but it is still just so hard... I am no CSS or html expert so I am relearning skills I have not really used for about 4 years. The last web project I worked on I had the luxury and the privilege to work again with my friend Greg Fyans, who is the BEST CSS, Accessibility and HTML guru I have ever seen.</p> <p>SharePoint is predominantly built using tables. Why, I don't know, in this world of CSS, but it is.</p> <p>MSDN has a three part article on \"<a href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/aa830818.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Customizing and Branding Web Content Management-Enabled SharePoint Sites</a>\" which is very informative, but which still lacks lead through. By that I mean that you select and load brands that already exist on the server and only add a single (ish) line of HTML to show how to customize it. This is not quite enough for me, but the articles are very usefully anyway.</p> <p>\_</p> <p>  </p><p> </p><p>XFN:  </p> <p>P.S. Although\_Greg Fyans\_CSS and HTML skills are beyond guru(Savant I think) his DotNetNuke skills are still being honed: I look forward to seeing his site up again.</p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_</div>"
