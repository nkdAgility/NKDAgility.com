    <p class="lead">Because of the compatibility with ARM and the new Windows 8
    touchscreen experience you would imagine that Office has undergone a rather
    complete overall and you would be right. With Office 2013 you get a fully
    touch capable immersive experience that is designed to work well on both the
    Tablet and the Desktop.</p>

    <p>Indeed Office 2013 is the first and only application that is certified to
    work on both the ARM desktop &amp; the PC Desktop.</p>

    <p>I have been using the Technology preview for quite some time and I have
    found it to be both stable and much more useful. You can’t really put you
    finger on it, it is just… better…</p>

    <p>While not usually though of as part of your Application Lifecycle
    Management (ALM) tooling in any modern application lifecycle it is
    essential.</p>

    <h3>New things I like about Office 2013</h3>

    <p>Its the little things that I like. All those little touches go to improve
    the whole like no large features can. I guess they have taken this
    opportunity to improve some of the underlying engine parts. Like some of the
    improvements in Windows 8, they are fundamental…</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Typing</strong> – There is an awesome thing that happens when
    you are typing that you only see when you yourself are typing. Watching or
    explaining does not enable the understanding… only using does…</li>

    <li><strong>Less freezing</strong> – While there is still a few areas that
    suffer from freezing, I am looking at you Outlook, there has been an overall
    improvement. Almost as if the Office team finally got time to read up on
    threading and asynchronous programming…</li>

    <li></li>

    </ul>

    <h3>The Install Experience</h3>

    <p>If you have Office 2013 Preview you will need to completely uninstall
    this first. If you “Start | ‘Unin’ | Settings | Uninstall a program” you
    should be able to put “2013” or “preview” into the search bar and complete
    the removal. And once you have it removed…</p>

    width="640" height="358" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure: Treated to
    the Office 2013 into video</strong></p>

    <p>As usual there are tones of new things that you can do with Office 2013,
    no least of which is the <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/allow-user-to-change-the-region-for-windows-live-id-billing/"
    target="_blank">ability to log in with your Microsoft ID</a> and have all of
    your SkyDrive data at the tip of your fingers.</p>

    <p>There are no install options and instead after the video you are just
    “done”. This is fine with me, and I think most people as everyone I know
    takes the default. Unless you were pushed for space, and lets face it, who
    is these days, then I just want to install everything anyway.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image43.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:

    width="640" height="400" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure: You are good
    to go with Office 2013</strong></p>

    <p>The install is so ridiculously easy that not a single person can get it
    wrong…</p>

    <h3>Why PowerPoint 2013 is an ALM tool</h3>

    <p>You would not immediately consider PowerPoint 2013 to be an ALM tool, but
    it is, and a darn good one. You can easily mock up interactions or
    storyboards and use animations to express to either your Stakeholders or to
    your Development Team exactly what it is that you are trying to make.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image44.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:

    PowerPoint 2013" alt="StoryBoarding with PowerPoint 2013"

    width="640" height="400" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    Storyboarding with PowerPoint 2013</strong></p>

    <p>This is an invaluable tool in your arsenal and if you have access to at
    least the Microsoft Test Professional SKU for Visual Studio 2012 you can
    access additional tools to help you make your story boards awesome.</p>

    <p>Installing the tools (available in Visual Studio 2012 Test Professional ,
    Visual Studio 2012 Premium and Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate) give you access
    to many development Storyboarding Shapes and adds the ability to connect
    your Storyboarding to work items in TFS.</p>

    <h3>Why Excel 2013 is an ALM tool</h3>

    <p>Team Foundation Server seamlessly integrates its operational store with
    Excel and this is the tool of choice when you are either bulk editing your
    work items, or if you are creating reports against the Data Warehouse and
    Cube. While the new web UI in Visual Studio 2012 is awesome, nothing can
    compete with the graphing, editing, functions and reporting that you can do
    right out of the box.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/10/image45.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:
    inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="Access your TFS
    operational store from within Excel 2013" alt="Access your TFS operational

    width="640" height="400" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure: Access your
    TFS operational store from within Excel 2013</strong></p>

    <p>This makes Excel 2013 a premier reporting and data manipulation tool in
    the ALM space.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>The new Office 2013 gives us the same awesome tool is a slicker faster
    package and there is no way that I will be complaining about that…</p>
