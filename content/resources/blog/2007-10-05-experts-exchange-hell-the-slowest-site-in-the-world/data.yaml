So I thought I would investigate how big the pages really are.</p> <p>The first test is to save the page \"Complete List of Zone Areas.mht\" and see how big/ or small it is...Well my jaw hit the floor and here is why:</p> <p>\_<a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"480\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image_thumb.png\" width=\"346\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>What are those guys at Experts Exchange thinking! I know we all have broadband, but this is ridiculous... I am on my corporate network and it is soooo slooow. It is slow from home as well, and that's a 20Mb Cable line...</p> <p>Even when you download it as a .htm file it is more than 1.2mb and its mainly the HTML :o And it still locks up IE7 on my Intel duo, 2gb laptop when viewing the page from my HDD.</p> <p>The main reason that I am writing this here instead of sending them feedback is I don't have the time to so:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.experts-exchange.com\">http://www.experts-exchange.com</a></p> <p>pause - 15 seconds</p> <p>Scroll - coz I only get the header on my windscreen display</p> <p>pause - 30 seconds</p> <p>Scroll more - coz the page is really big</p> <p>pause - 28 seconds</p> <p>click link- coz I only get the header on my windscreen display</p> <p>pause - 15 seconds</p> <p>...sod it, I'm board...</p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image_1.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ExpertsExchangeHellTheslowestsiteinthew_F058-image_thumb_1.png\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Fail\" rel=\"tag\">Fail</a>\_</div>"

      In reality it doesn't matter because no one really uses experts-exchange.
      The information they provide is readily accessible elsewhere on the net,
      and is much faster/ free/ or doesn't require participation ;)

      You wont believe but I have blocked their website on my pc so by mistake
      also I dont visit their website when it comes in google search. It saves
      time.

      Couple of things <br />"because no one really uses experts-exchange"<br
      /><br />Were have you got your numbers from.  No one really uses Experts
      Exchange is quite ambiguous.  I mean I am an active participant, and in
      some occasions I have not got time to be googling, so I ask a specific
      question and within 20 minutes on average I have the solution and a
      detailed walkthrough with exact links.  Think of it like this, post the
      question then not only am I googling for the solution, I have at least 5
      others googling it too, or EVENT better accessing their own knowledge as
      they know the solution straight away.<br /><br />A lot of people see their
      arse when they have to pay for things,  BUT I am not one of them people
      and besides which, if you participate you get unlimited points to ask as
      many questions as you like.  Like i Have lol.<br /><br />BUT all that said
      YEH, it drives me up the wall this new site they have made, the speed is
      shocking.  Firefox renders it better and also google Chrome.  I want them
      to go back to the legacy site.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Andrew

      Sorry Andrew, but experts normally use the expert profile and won't have
      to load all the advertisements.<br />Just try once to make a colleague a
      new expert member and experience how "well hidden" this free backdoor to
      EE is.<br /><br />I've switched to www.bytes.com and there everything is
      free and members and experts are valued. This year the experts and
      moderators are offered an Amazon voucher or the possibility to donate the
      $$ to UNICEF. That's the way I prefer and my numerous EE T-shirts are now
      good for polishing my car :-)<br /><br />For those interested in how
      Experts Exchange handles quality/service aware experts check my blog at
      http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,2000342184b,00.htm it's
      almost pathetic how they handle complains/criticism towards the site. <br
      /><br />Nic;o)
