    <p>As part of the Scrum.org webinar “Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer -
    Martin Hinshelwood - Answering Your Most Pressing Scrum Questions” I was
    asked a number of questions. Since not only was I on the spot and live, I
    thought that I should answer each question that was asked again here, as
    well as those questions I did not get to.</p>

    What's the best way to work around multiple POs and the fact that they don't
    give good stories and do not all show up for BR meetings to break down the
    incomplete stories. Small company.</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>It sounds to me like you don’t have any Product Owners. There does not
    seem to be anyone at your organisation taking ownership of the backlog and
    being accountable for value delivery.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>My first choice would be to raise this with management and ask:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li>Is it ok to spend money on items that have not been validated as
    needed?</li><li>Is it ok to spend money on what might not be the next most
    important thing for the business?</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The value of the Product Owner is someone that can focus on the Product
    and its future direction. While everyone on the Scrum Team(s) are
    responsible for the product future, the Product Owner can focus specifically
    on market, competition, and user trends to shape and order the Product
    Backlog so that your Scrum Team is able to deliver the next most important
    feature for the business. This is hard, a lot of work, and requires
    specialist skills that need practice, experimentation, and time to hone.
    Without these skills, coupled with good data, we are just fumbling in the
    dark and hoping that we randomly stumble upon a useful feature for our
    users.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Find the right Product Owner, or select someone from your team to take
    that responsibility while you find the right person. If it was me I would
    walk into the CEO’s office and lay the problem out, as well as the cost to
    the business of building the wrong features.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The industry average is that we spend 65% (Source: Standish Group) of our
    time working on the wrong feature. The Product Owners job is to minimise
    this figure. What does your CEO think is the cost of not having anyone at
    the helm?</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>While there are no right answers there are some answers that are better
    than others. For your given situation select the most right answer and
    iteration to the best version of it.</p>
