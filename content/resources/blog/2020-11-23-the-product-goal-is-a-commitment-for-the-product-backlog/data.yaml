    <p>In <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/">the 2020 Scrum
    Guide</a> Ken and Jeff introduces the idea of the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a>. The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a> is a commitment to ensure transparency and focus against
    progress.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Product Goal describes a future
    state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan
    against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product
    Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfil the Product Goal.<br />A
    product is a vehicle to deliver value. It has a clear boundary, known
    stakeholders, well-defined users or customers. A product could be a service,
    a physical product, or something more abstract.<br />The Product Goal is the
    long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfil (or abandon) one
    objective before taking on the next.</p><cite><a

    <p>The Product Goal is an objective to try and meet rather than a guarantee.
    We may start on the journey towards the Product Goal and discover that there
    is a better place to go. While the Product Goal is there to give the Scrum
    Team focus towards an overall objective, it is also important to realise
    that it is not immutable. If the Scrum Team realise that the Goal is no
    longer valuable, or that some other goal becomes more valuable then they
    should change it.</p>

    <p>Some Good Examples of a Product Goal:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li>"Reach 10,000 new users in 6 months"</li><li>"Improve the customer
    experience by improving the NPS over the next year"</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a> should be a singular Goal that each Sprint Goal can be crafted
    towards. It should be short, measurable, and easy to understand. Everyone on
    the Scrum Team and the wider organisation should understand it and how the
    work that they are doing contributes to it. It is similar to the Visionary
    Goal that a Business Doctor I engaged helped me create for my business.
    Every product, every project, and every business should have a Visionary
    Goal. In Scrum, we call it the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a>.</p>
