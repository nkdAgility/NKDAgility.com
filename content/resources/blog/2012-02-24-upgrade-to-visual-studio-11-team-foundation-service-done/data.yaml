    <p>Jason Zander has just announced that the Visual Studio 11 &amp; Visual
    Studio 11 Team Foundation Server Beta <strong>will be available on the 29th
    February 2012</strong>. I am really looking forward to this launch as it
    embodies the phrase “spit &amp; polish” and really lowers the bar for entry
    into the Team Foundation Server world.</p> <p>Unless you have been living
    under a rock you should also be aware of <a
    href="http://tfspreview.com">http://tfspreview.com</a>, the cloud based
    version of Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server that has been running in
    beta for a while. As well as the on-premises version of TFS offering Go-Live
    with Visual Studio 11 Beta, the cloud version has been offering Go-Live for
    a while now. </p> <p>Microsoft themselves use it for many projects including
    the Visual Studio 11 ALM team themselves so it is kind of like them giving
    us access to their own dog-fooding server as well. Bu the reality of it is
    that they are fully supporting it. </p> <p>So why should you NOT go to the
    cloud?</p> <ul> <li><strong>No Legacy Support</strong> - You can’t use
    Visual Studio 2008 or 2005 to access it. <br />Note: This support is not
    there yet and no promises have been made as to when, if ever, it will be
    available.</li> <li><strong>No Custom Work Item Types</strong> – You can
    only use the process templates that come out-of-the-box.<br />Note: Again,
    no news yet on when this might be coming</li> <li><strong>No Lab
    Management</strong> – And don’t expect to see this soon, its hard.</li></ul>
    <p>Now that is out of the way – Why should you move to the cloud?</p> <ul>
    <li><strong>No Server to support</strong> – Microsoft will do all of the
    management for you</li> <li><strong>Automatic Team Project Upgrades</strong>
    – As Microsoft update the product your process template will be upgraded
    gracefully<br />note: Hence why there are no changes allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Awesome UI improvements</strong> – There are no words to
    describe how fantastic the new UI is. And not just compared to the 2010
    version, I think the competition is a little worried.</li> <li><strong>More
    to Come</strong> – The cloud team has managed to get its update frequency
    down for one every 3 months to about once a month so expect to see the
    features as soon as they are ready.<br />Note: <a
    href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jasonz/">Jason Zander</a> has committed (see
    his <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/ALM-Summit/2011">ALM Summit
    talk</a>) to get this down to one a week!</li></ul> <p>And on that note, I
    just completed my first customer transition to the cloud. I have had a few
    customers with interest in moving, and most of those are currently playing
    with it, but it is a big decision. This customer did not yet have Source
    Control and was still stuck on a file share with work item tracking done of
    paper! </p> <p>So I said “You guys need a cloud solution?” and they said
    “Yipee! Lets go!”</p> <ul> <li><strong>Rearrange your Source<br
    /></strong><br />Importing source into any source control system is hard as
    you want to be sure of your layout. So we had a couple of session on <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/guidance-how-to-layout-you-files-for-an-ideal-solution/">how
    to layout your source code</a> (note: I need to update that) and settled on
    a model that worked. They studiously went away and mapped some of their
    projects into that format and imported it into a Trial project in TFS.<br

    <a href="http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/">TFS Integration Platform</a>
    to move all of your Source and Work Items to the cloud.</font><br /></li>
    <li><strong>Adding source control bindings</strong><br /><br />You can
    easily import whole folders full of source by setting a mapping in TFS and
    dropping the folders to import under it. Then when you open the solution in
    Visual Studio 2010 you will first have to Upgrade it then manage the
    Bindings to source control so that the files know that they should be
    talking toTFS.<br /><br /><a

    did an overview of Agile Product Planning the features of the tool to get
    them started, but it will take time before they are fully up to speed.<br

    barrier for entry</strong></li></ul> <p>Well, that's it. </p> <p>My first
    customer has moved Source Control &amp; Work Item Tracking to Visual Studio
    11 Team Foundation <strong>Service</strong>. Granted it was an easy one, and
    not all are. But I just wanted to show how easy it can be. The barrier for
    entry on this one was practically nil and it was an awesome and painless
    experience for both the customer and me.</p> <p>In a couple of weeks I will
    loop back with that customer to see how they are getting on and to setup
    Automated Build for them…</p>
