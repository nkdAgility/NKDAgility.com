  - "<p>I am a little confused by all the hullabaloo over the Outlook email changes <a title=\"Mary Jo Foley\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/\">Mary Jo Foley</a> recently blogged in her article <a title=\"Permalink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"bookmark\" href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/wp-trackback.php?p=200\">Outlook 2007 users angry over Office 2007 HTML-e-mail changes</a> about some of the changes. I think that this change is a good thing. It moves away from emails being HTML and more towards them as documents. This is the way that most users use email, as documents and it would be much better to have email files as Open XML, there by allowing searching and indexing of the emails in a much easier way.</p>\n<p>This is a move forward in email, not backward.\_It may be a move backward for\_the design of marketing emails, but who cares, not the users.\_IT is an ever changing field, if you can't embrace that then you really should not be in IT.</p>\n<p>It is not the users that are angry. Why would they be, this does not significantly affect them. It is the developers and designers that are angry, get with the program...</p>\n<p>Are there any USERS out there that are angry?

      Martin,

      <br>

      <br>Spam is annoying. Marketing is annoying. Large email downloads are
      annoying.

      <br>

      <br>On the other hand...

      <br>

      <br>The newletters I have otped into, for reader interest, product
      patriotism, ebay purchases and soforth all use HTML/CSS. If they go back
      to table design, the download will be bigger, uglier and harder to read.

      <br>

      <br>Alistapart shows how easily CSS alone can remove the need for
      excessive images, and I believe, in time, we could have seen that happen
      more.

      <br>

      <br>if (html == spam){

      <br> eathat($self, $now);

      <br>}

      <br>

      <br>Sincerely,

      <br>A developer and newsletter subscriber with a knack for minimal and
      compliant design that now has a harder time sending and receiving
      informative non-spam emails.

      <br>Dale.

      <br>

      <br>If you wish to contact me, do so through the URL above.

      Maybe, but as you said...

      <br>  &quot;_Pointless = true

      <br>  _Accesability = false&quot;

      <br>

      <br>When combined with too much code, the all too common word habits (such
      as large images reduced in display dimensions but not in file dimensions)
      and then factor in the whole fact that word has nowhere near the spread,
      or cross platform capabilities that html does.

      <br>

      <br>Flash beats Word.

      Ahh, but the new format is OpenXML not a custom word format. Which does
      have the cross platform capabilities as all XML does. It is a published
      document format that describes a document. Which is what 90% of email are.
      Documents passed between people and businesses. Only a small part of all
      email sent are marketing emails. 

      <br>

      <br>Marketing is to email as Mac is to Windows!

      Outlook 2007 doesn't sent OpenXML, and it's not open because there aren't
      ANY other programs that can read it besides of MS Word..... <br /><br />If
      it's up to MS they would like to standardize e-mail according to their
      standards. They would standardize the internet... Luckily this never
      happened and never shall happen, otherwise we were very restricted in ways
      MS is known for.<br />The Internet exists of really open standards, not MS
      standards...<br /><br />Outlook 2007 uses Word 2007 to render it's HTML
      which is an entirely different story and a really strange one too. Why
      reinvent HTML rendering of 10 years ago? They should have put an option to
      block some HTML elements, but this way it's a step back.<br /><br />You
      know, when Outlook 2000 went around it used indeed some specific Microsoft
      format: RTF! This is why other e-mail programs got strange winmail.dat
      attachments.

      Team Foundation Server is available through the SPLA licensing program,
      enabling hosters to potentially offer a Team Foundation Server hosted
      offering. See the attached overview document for SPLA pricing details. To
      date there are no hosters offering such a service. However, we are running
      a pilot program with several hosters and a handful of customers to begin
      the process of building a partner ecosystem of TFS hosters.
