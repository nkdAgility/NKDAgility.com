    <p class="lead">There were many new improvements in Visual Studio ALM that
    were announced at this years ALM Summit event that I can only pick a few to
    highlight as my favourites. <a

    Harry did the keynote</a> on the second day and almost immediately announced
    Visual Studio 2012.2 CTP 2&nbsp; and a bunch of new features some of which
    were made available in TF Service (<a
    href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com">http://tfs.visualstudio.com</a>)
    immediately.</p>

    <p>Although most of these features are available now on TF Service you will
    have to wait for some of them until TF Server 2012.2 RTM’s or even TF Server
    201x (Dev12). So what are these fabulous features that have been made
    available:</p>

    <h2 class="icon-solution">DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)</h2>

    <p>Full fidelity implementation of Git to allow Visual Studio to natively
    support Git repositories and for you to choose to use Git as your DVCS
    version control of choice in TF Service. You will however need to wait until
    Dev12 (TF Server 201x) to see it on premises.</p>

    DVCS</strong></p>

    <p><small><span class="label label-info">Note</span>My favourite way to use
    this is to <a
    href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/en-us/learn/code/create-code-project-vs-git">create
    a local Git repository</a> with Visual Studio but publish changes to TF
    Server. Unfortunate for now you need to use the command line until an option
    is added to the UI which should not be long at the current pace of
    development.</small></p>

    <h2 class="icon-solution">Quality Enablement Improvements in Visual Studio
    ALM</h2>

    <p>Did you wonder why you cant create and manage your test case
    infrastructure just like in Microsoft Test Manager but from the web? Well
    now you can not only create and manage Test Plans, Settings and Cases but
    you also get a web based Test Runner to allow you to run your manual tests
    on any platform and collate that data.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image"
    alt="image" src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2013/02/image1.png"
    width="800" height="399" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Test Hub in
    Action</strong></p>

    <p>This Test Hub in the web access makes adopting Acceptance Test Driven
    Development (ATDD) or just doing some functional testing trivial. Say
    goodbye to excel as your test recording tool and be part of the awesome
    tractability in Team Foundation Server.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"
    title="image" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2013/02/image2.png" width="800"
    height="450" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Web Test Runner in
    Chrome</strong></p>

    <p>You can use this test runner to record your test results on any platform
    that can render html5 and JavaScript so the supported platform list just
    expanded.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-solution">Kanban swim lanes</h2>

    <p><strong></strong>If you have used the current incarnation of Kanban
    implemented in Update 1 you will know there is still an issue of having the
    accordion like states that Kanban likes without breaking TFS. With Update 2
    for TF Server the team has added the ability to have those multiple swim
    lanes that allow you to model your current process without being forced to
    add all of your states to your process and rewrite all of your reports.</p>

    <p><img alt=""
    src="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-36-52-metablogapi/1777.image_5F00_thumb_5F00_5912078B.png"
    /><br /><strong>Figure: You can Customise the columns</strong></p>

    <p>Adding new columns is so easy as you can simply free text them up and map
    them to an existing state of your Backlog work items. This allows you to
    stack out as many states as you need to support your process.</p>

    <p>I am not sure yet what will happen if you add 20 columns, but hopefully
    you will already have gone through some of process improvement initiative
    and decided that having 20 states is a little… confusing…</p>

    <h2 class="icon-solution">Work Item Tagging</h2>

    <p>A Work Item Tracking tagging system that allows you not only to tag work
    items with any text you like, but to filter your queries by those tags. Live
    on TF Service and coming in TF Server 2012.2</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;"
    title="image" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2013/02/image3.png" width="800"
    height="399" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Adding Tags for each of my
    Personas</strong></p>

    <p>This is massive as it allows me to add data to my work item without
    having to go an edit the work item type. In most cases we just want an extra
    piece of information attached to our work items so that we can filter search
    results and more easily find what we want. This is a good start at that and
    allows us to filter our backlogs and queries when we have many, or just more
    focus on one area.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>There were so many new features that it is hard to pick out a clear
    favourite. Indeed there are three categories of wins that are available
    right now. First is the reduction in the requirement to customise templates
    that results from the introduction of tagging. Second is the addition of the
    web based Test Management that will bring many more teams into Team
    Foundation Server. But the last is perhaps the biggest from an adoption
    perspective as many teams want to use Git either as individuals or as small
    teams, but still leverage the massive benefits of the Visual Studio ALM
    platform.</p>

    Foundation Server</strong></p>

    <p>We are starting to see the enablement of the traceability story for a
    wider audience and across more platforms.</p>

      Hi,


      How can you link the Storyboards to Feedback? Because from Feedback client
      you can create only Feedback type workitems?

      Or am I missing something?

      Thank you.Daniel.
