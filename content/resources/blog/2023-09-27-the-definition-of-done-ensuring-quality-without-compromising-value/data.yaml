    <p>The Definition of Done (DoD) is a sacrosanct measure of quality, ensuring
    that every piece of work meets the standards necessary for release. On the
    other hand, acceptance criteria focus on the work's content. Merging the two
    can risk the integrity of a working, usable product. This article delves
    into the nuances of maintaining the sanctity of the DoD while ensuring the
    delivery of valuable increments.</p>

    having Acceptance Criteria on the Definition of Done risks the sanctity of
    the working usable product</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The DoD is my touchstone for quality. It's a measurable and automatable
    standard that ensures every increment is of a certain quality. Introducing
    optional or non-executable elements into the DoD can diminish its
    importance, potentially jeopardising the transparency and empiricism
    foundational to our work.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The DoD isn't about guaranteeing functionality but ensuring that what
    we've built works. It's the bedrock of transparency. If stakeholders are
    still determining whether the work meets the necessary standards for
    release, there needs to be more clarity on the additional effort required.
    Similarly, if Developers are unsure of these standards, they can't
    accurately gauge the work needed.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Incorporating elements that might undermine this transparency or minimise
    these standards is a risk we shouldn't take. The DoD's primary purpose is to
    maintain this clarity.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"
    id="h-why-having-acceptance-criteria-on-the-definition-of-done-may-not-risk-the-sanctity-of-the-working-usable-product">Why
    having Acceptance Criteria on the Definition of Done may not risk the
    sanctity of the working usable product</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>There are instances where quality measures form part of the acceptance
    criteria. In such cases, one might be tempted to add "must meet acceptance
    criteria" to the DoD. However, this can jeopardise the team's flexibility in
    determining the Sprint's contents while upholding the DoD's sanctity.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Instead, we should scrutinise the acceptance criteria. If specific
    criteria always need to be true, they should be incorporated into the
    standards and, by extension, the DoD. For instance, criteria like "all
    content is spelled correctly and has good grammar" or "all copy meets visual
    spacing guidelines" can be integrated into the DoD.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you're keen on including acceptance criteria in the DoD and wish to
    maintain the flexibility of value delivery, consider phrasing it as "for all
    work delivered in the Sprint, quality-based acceptance criteria on each
    backlog item are fulfilled". This retains the original intent while allowing
    the team to adapt based on their learnings.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The DoD aims to ensure transparency, confirming that all showcased work
    meets our product's standards. Anything that jeopardises this transparency
    or the adaptability of Sprint's contents should be approached with caution.
    Only adopt such changes if you can guarantee the preservation of
    adaptability and transparency.</p>
