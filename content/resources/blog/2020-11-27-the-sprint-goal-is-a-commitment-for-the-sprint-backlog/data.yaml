    <p>In <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/">the 2020 Scrum
    Guide</a> Ken and Jeff augmented the idea of the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a>. The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal"></a><a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a> is a
    commitment to ensure transparency and focus against progress during a
    Sprint.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Sprint Goal is the single
    objective for the Sprint. Although the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goa</a>l is a
    commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact
    work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus,
    encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate
    initiatives.<br />The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning
    event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during
    the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be
    different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to
    negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without
    affecting the Sprint Goal.</p><cite><a

    <p>The Sprint Goal is a short term mission that can be achieved in service
    to the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-product-goal-is-a-commitment-for-the-product-backlog">Product
    Goal</a>.  The Sprint Goal should describe the idea of "Why are we doing
    this Sprint" and should encapsulate a step towards that desired outcome.
    There should only be one per Sprint, to give the team focus.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide">Scrum Guide</a>
    is not going to tell you what your Sprint Goals should be, this is something
    that is unique to your business context, and should be heavily influenced by
    the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-product-goal-is-a-commitment-for-the-product-backlog">Product
    Goal</a>. I would expect the Product Owner to come to Sprint Planning with
    an idea of what the next Sprints Sprint Goal should be, as well as likely
    Backlog Items that fit. If this idea, through a prospective Sprint Goal is
    communicated effectively with the Developers then they will be prepared for
    Sprint Planning.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Some Good Examples of a Product Goal:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li>"Add [capability] to entice new users"</li><li>"Improve [feature] to
    make it more usable"</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The Sprint Goal should represent the next most valuable outcome towards
    the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-product-goal-is-a-commitment-for-the-product-backlog">Product
    Goal</a>, and is part of the Sprint Backlog. It is the commitment that is
    made by the Developers towards a valuable outcome. It help the Developers
    understand the purpose, and should give them enough information to help them
    make the right choices during the Sprint.</p>
