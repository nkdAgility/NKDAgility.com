    Last week I was teaching a Professional Scrum Foundations in Farnborough and
    I had to make sure that I got a hotel with awesome internet access. As well
    as teaching the class I Have two additional tasks for the week. The first
    was to have the honour of talking on ScrumPulse, Scrum.org's webcast, and
    the second was to talk at the prestigious Dutch ALM Meetup.


    Both topics were the same with "Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual
    Studio Team Services" but the interactivity and available time was
    substantially different with only really 45 minutes in the webcast and
    nearly 3 hours for the workshop.


    <h2>Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services Webcast</h2>


    Tools don't solve problems, but they can help reduce the friction of Scaling
    Professional Scrum. The only way to successfully scale across multiple
    teams, maybe in multiple countries, is to create robust automation and
    orchestration for minimizing the risks, and time, of manual tasks. Visual
    Studio Team Services allows you to create a robust, platform agnostic,
    support structure that can start where you are, and grow as your needs
    mature. One Scrum Team, One Nexus, or many...


    See how it grows...

    You can also view the <a href="http://nkdagility.net/SPSwithVSTS">slides</a>
    from docs.com


    <em>Before viewing the webcast please make sure that you have familiarised
    yourself with the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/Resources/The-Nexus-Guide"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Guide</a>. I did not have time to go
    through the entire process and focused instead on how you might implement a
    single Nexus in VSTS with suggestions on how to implement many Nexus.</em>


    Although there were over 800 registrations for the event the meeting
    software only supported 100 participants. If you were signed up and were
    unable to attend then you can view the recording. Scrum.org is looking at
    options to support the larger number of participants in the future.


    The event was recorded, and has been published as "<a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o8YuisXZzc">Scaling Professional
    Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services</a>" on the Scrum.org YouTube
    channel. We also have <a href="https://doc.co/LPzMBT">published the
    slides</a> for you as well.


    <h2>Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team Services
    Workshop</h2>


    Find out how to organize many teams of work in VSTS within a Nexus (3-9
    teams) and control what data is shown to who. Martin will introduce Nexus as
    a compliment to Scrum and demonstrate how to setup VSTS to support it, then
    let you get your hands dirtyâ€¦


    This time no other than Martin Hinshelwood will join us for an interesting
    evening around Scrum for Team of Teams. Martin is an independent consultant
    at nkdAgility (<a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/">https://nkdagility.com/</a>) and runs his own
    business at customers all over the world.

    This was done as an interactive 3 hour workshop with live hands on with Team
    Services. As this meeting was live only I can only refer you to the webcast
    above. However if you want me to come and do this workshop at your User
    Group then please let me know.</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>


    While there are many tools out there to support Scrum only Visual Studio
    Team Services really support scaling scrum to the enterprise. If you have
    many teams working together on a single product then there is no better tool
    at scale than Visual Studio Team Services.


    Get in touch if you want me to speak at a User Group, if <a

    target="_blank" rel="noopener">I am going to be in your area</a> then let me
    know!

    Both as a 1 hour ScrumPulse and a team based workshop for the Dutch ALM UG I
    did sessions entitled Scaling Professional Scrum with Visual Studio Team
    Services. I showed how to use Team Services in the scope of multiple
    collaborative teams (or a Nexus) working on a single product.

      [&#8230;] I have been teaching the Professional Scrum Developer (PSD)
      training and working with software teams&nbsp;for 7 years. I have never
      encountered a better platform than Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) for
      managing the metadata required to facilitate the building of professional
      software on a regular cadence in any technology that is deployed to any
      platform. I have seen Java, .NET, Web, Android, iOS, and Mainframe teams
      all working together in VSTS with a shared vision and access to the same
      metadata. If you have many teams I did a webcast for Scrum.org on Scaling
      Professional Scrum with VSTS. [&#8230;]
