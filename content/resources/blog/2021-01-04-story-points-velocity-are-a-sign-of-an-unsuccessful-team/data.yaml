    <p>Story Points and velocity have been used for many years in the Scrum
    community and have been engrained so much in the way that things are done
    that most folks believe that they are part of Scrum. The accepted wisdom is
    that Scrum Teams are supposed to use User Stories, Story Points, and
    Velocity to measure their work. </p>

    <p><strong>Accepted wisdom is wrong! </strong></p>

    <p>There are a number of things that we collectively believe are required to
    do Scrum, and these have been perpetrated by the long-running perseverance
    of trainers teaching to the lowest common denominator and keeping things as
    simple as possible. There is the general consensus in the trainer community
    that folks that attend Scrum training are not smart enough to do anything
    else. However, if you go have a look at the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Scrum Guide</a> and see
    how many time common things that you believe are mandated in Scrum are
    referenced:</p>

    <p>The answer to all of these searchers is zero! These are complementary
    practices that may or may not work within the bounds of your organisational
    complexity, and all of these are an indication to me that your organisations
    are only<a

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>It's ok for a team to start with Story Points and Velocity. There are
    many things that change when a team moves from the traditional project
    management practices of the past to the empirical practices of the future,
    and sometimes we need to pick our battles. One such battle is that of story
    points and velocity and in fact all of the gubbins surrounding it. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Perhaps you need to appease other parts of the organisation that are not
    yet ready for change. Perhaps you have a long journey and this is just
    somewhere to start.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>Story Points &amp; Velocity can be a good starting
    point!</strong></p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>I am not saying that there is no value in Story Points or Planning Poker.
    When a team is just starting out they need to keep things simple and iterate
    towards better outcomes. We often start from typical traditional practices
    and Planning Poker becomes a good learning point. Story Points use rough
    sizing as a way to analyze the work and break it down. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Because really, the scores are made up and the points don't matter. It's
    the conversation that is a valuable thing. The shared understanding that the
    participants get by having some way to know when they don't understand the
    same things. <strong>That is awesome.</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>However, agile teams try to use Story Points and Velocity for future
    predictability and this is a fallacy. While I would be OK with a team using
    it for a while, if an Agile Team is still using Velocity and Story Points
    after they have 5 or 10 sprints under their belt then I would have serious
    concerns about their ability to adapt to change and their sincerity towards
    that change. What I mean is that they just don't understand their work or
    its nature; This is what I mean by immaturity, and not that something else
    is a sign of maturity!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Indeed as the Scrum Team using Story Points really has no consistent
    reference they are just shooting in the dark the same as they were before.
    </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>While they have gained an understanding of the goals, they still don't
    have an understanding of the predictability and thus no confidence in their
    predictions. We need concrete data to build trust with stakeholders that we
    know what we are talking about.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>We need confidence!</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Velocity was a way to assert that confidence with a plot of our delivered
    story points, and along with some clever calculations we asserted that we
    were likely to deliver about 20 story points. This was such a wholly
    improbable assumption that the vast majority of Scrum Teams talk about
    "carry-over" points and quiz me about how to represent that. Do you
    re-estimate and stick it on the backlog, does it move to the next
    sprint?</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Scrum Teams have been basing their confidence to stakeholders on an
    agreed consensus that cant be compared and is susceptible to any change from
    the makeup of the team from the estimation room.</p>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Confidence is gained by truly understanding the uncertainty of delivery
    and factoring it into our projections. How sure are you that you will be
    able to deliver? No really! what is your statistical level of
    confidence?</p>

    <p>In the empirical world where more is unknown than known, we don't plan
    all of the work (it will change) and we cant tell you when things will be
    done.<strong> </strong></p>

    <p><strong>Except when we can!</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>The Increment is the Confidence of Transparency of the
    Future</strong> - If we have a Scrum Team then I should be confident in
    saying that we will have a usable increment at the end of every Sprint. If
    that is true, then we can have 100% confidence that we can deliver the
    output from the last Sprint. It works, and it's done!</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>The Product Backlog is the Confidence of Transparency of the
    Future</strong> - Since we have a backlog that has been ordered by the
    Product Owner, who is accountable for maximizing the value delivered I can
    be confident that what we have Done represents the most valuable things that
    we could have done.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p> With both of these being true we can have 100% confidence that we have
    the most valuable items that the business needs to be completed and ready to
    deploy. Every additional Sprint just adds to the quantity of value.</p>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Using a cycle time scatter plot we can assess and find our confidence
    levels, and even <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-kanban-guide-for-scrum-teams/#h-service-level-expectation-sle">create
    a Service Level Expectation</a>, that allows us to measure progress against.
    </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>You can use this range of confidence levels to determine your current
    levels of predictability, and monitor the effect of changes that you make to
    your system on it. If you have an 85% confidence level of 16 days and you're
    on 2-week Sprints then you have a problem.</p>
