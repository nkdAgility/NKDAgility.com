      Not an April fools' trick after all, huh? Designer has always been the key
      to SharePoint, so the move is most welcome. I hope there's not too much
      frustration over having rushed to buy a copy.<br /><br />Regards

      With a lot of hesitation I am asking this quesiton to you. Hesitation coz
      I fear your answer could be a lot more technical than what I would
      understand. But I would ask nevertheless. I am trying to create a list
      which would contain all the business requests(which may/may not be
      projects) for all the areas under my supervision. e.g. HR-benefits,
      HR-payroll, Audits etc. Now all these people need to view the requests
      pertaining to their depts. I am therefore, creating views for every area
      and restricting their view of the master list(i did this by adding another
      column in the list and adding a condition, show items where area ="" and
      users != [Me]) Anyway, so I did that but how do  make sure that every
      dept's default view of this list is the view for their area? In other
      words Benefits ppl click on this list and they are only looking at the
      view that I designed for them. I hope what I wrote makes sense and you
      will be able to help me. Just so you know I do not have sharepoint
      designer. Could you help??
