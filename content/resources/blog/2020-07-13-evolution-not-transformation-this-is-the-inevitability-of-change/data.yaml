    <p>There is no such thing as an Agile Transformation, Digital
    Transformation, DevOps Transformation, or any of the Whatever Transformation
    that you can think of or have been sold. You can’t buy agility, and you
    certainly can't install it. There is no end state, no optimal outcome, No
    best practices. <a

    <p>Instead, you have to grow, nurture, and prune agility as it grows
    organically inside your organization and eventually, you too will be able to
    take advantage of business opportunities as they arise in the ever-changing
    marketplace. This is continuous change…</p>

    <p>Due to the long timelines, it is easy to see the change that happens over
    a long period of time as a transformation, as a caterpillar transforms into
    the butterfly. The idea of a <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)"
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/many-organisations-are-lured-to-safe-by-the-song-of-the-sirens/"
    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defigned start and end state is an
    illusion that lures us from the realities</a> of how things successfully
    change; through a continuous set of experiments. The successful experiments
    succeed and do well in a niche, the unsuccessful ones fail and die. The more
    experiments that you run, the more likely you are to find something that
    fits a niche better or opens up a new niche.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>During the Industrial Revolution, when traditional management practices
    were developed, the ebb and flow of niches was a slow and deliberate
    endeavour, usually driven by a single educated visionary. The pace of change
    was much slower, both communication systems and education systems were weak,
    and niches that companies found were long-lived, often tens if not hundreds
    of years; they only needed to adapt once, and then optimise for the current
    state. The change was no longer necessary, and the competition was weak and
    slow to disrupt markets. A company, once established, could own a niche,
    seemingly forever. Bureaucracy was born as a way to solidify the newly found
    market and optimise the product delivery with best practices. We could own
    that space!</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Today the world flows faster; due to the increase in education levels and
    the advancement of technologies, and it's not slowing down. As things flow
    faster so our need to react to this new pace of development increases. Thus
    a virtuous cycle of increasing change perpetuates.  Many organisations,
    rather than embracing this new reality, incorporate change in large and
    expensive fits and starts, rather than as a continuous flow. They only
    change when they feel threatened, and just change one bureaucratic system
    for another just as static. This inability to evolve in a continuous flow
    means that many organisations die; Where is Blockbuster, or Kodak.</p>

    <p>As yourself, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)"

    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would your organisation would have
    survived COVID</a> 20 years ago, or even 10. With 100% of your employees
    working from home, how has your infrastructure cooped? If you are still
    operating on a traditional "employees must be controlled" management mindset
    then you were likely still operating centralised VPN, which could not cope
    with the new load. You had neither the bandwidth nor the licences to support
    100% remote workforce.  However if over the last 10 years you had adopted
    cloud services then you likely felt less of a pinch. Your employees likely
    felt that speeds were faster as they no longer needed to share the finite
    office bandwidth with their colleagues. That change you made from
    on-premises to the cloud may have saved your business, but did you adopt it
    by evolution or transformation? </p>

    <p>I often hear "if it ain't broke, don't fix it", but this is a phrase of
    the past. Today the pace of change in the world means that we need a new
    mantra, one not steeped in traditional management practices or weighed down
    by the baggage of the past. We need to embrace change, and that means
    accepting a higher degree of risk, <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new

    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mitigated by a higher degree of
    competence</a>. Evolution is about embracing that risk and learning from its
    failures. Success is the result of continuous experimentation at a
    sustainable pace that is able to take advantage of current business
    opportunities as they arise.</p>

    <h2 id="h-orienteering-towards-your-intended-outcome">Orienteering towards
    your intended outcome</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The best analogy for this continuous state of evolving, refining,
    improving, adapting, enhancing, and changing that I have encountered is
    Orienteering. Orienteering is a technique for map reading and
    direction-finding that developed by the military to train soldiers to find
    their way. Today it is a sport, and is often taught in schools; at least, it
    was in mine.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image
    {"align":"center","id":44560,"sizeSlug":"medium","dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}}
    -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-19-800x450.png"
    alt="Orienteering towards a goal with continuous refinement of direction as
    impediments are removed" class="wp-image-44560"/><figcaption
    class="wp-element-caption">Orienteering towards a goal with continuous
    refinement of direction as impediments are removed</figcaption></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In Orienteering, like with any corporate endeavour, you should have some
    kind of vision or intended goal in mind. This is your current destination.
    You then use a compass and a map to figure out which direction, next steps,
    you need to take to get closer to that destination. As you take each step
    you may encounter obstacles or impediments that challenge you, and that you
    have to figure a way around.  You may need to take a large detour in order
    to traverse an obstacle or impediment, so you need to reassess your next
    steps by consulting the map and compass. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The bit where I feel that orienteering as a sport does not fit is that it
    generally has a fixed route with prescribed checkpoints along the way. This
    is a little more analogous to traditional project management rather than
    modern practices. However, orienteering in its original military context
    would have been a lot more fluid, with changing tactical realities as you
    progress towards your vision, and this is exactly what we are looking for.
    Your end goal will evolve over time as the business conditions change and
    you may have to reassess your tactical direction and doctrine as you
    discover more.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Always remember that this is your business, your organisation, your
    people, and their livelihood. You are accountable for your organisation's
    success or failure. In order to change it effectively, you need to create
    leaders inside your organisation that understand these modern management
    techniques and know why we need to change. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>To do that you, not some external coach or consultant, need to be in the
    driver's seat, making the decisions that are necessary to evolve your
    organisation. External people can help you learn these new techniques and
    coach you and your leadership team towards dismantling the bureaucracy that
    has built up over many years. They can help facilitate new interactions and
    fuel engagement and enthusiasm for the new practices and techniques, but you
    need to own them. You as a leader need to embody evolutionary practices with
    your organisation and foster it internally. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>While there are some well-known practices, like self-organising teams,
    that help almost everyone, many of the practices you create will be your
    own. The difficulty is creating an environment within your organisation
    where these new techniques don't become the new bureaucracy, but instead
    create a continuous state of evolving, refining, improving, adapting,
    enhancing, and changing processes, practices, and tools that help you
    succeed.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>You as leaders need to understand why you are making each decision, and
    what you expect the outcomes for the organisations to be.  </p>

    <p><strong>You! </strong></p>

    <p>As you take each step you may realise that you were wrong, that this

    that somewhere else is a better place than you envisaged, and then figure
    out where you need to go next. Be free to experiment, accept that any
    processes and practices will be imperfectly defined, and adapt to what you
    discover along the way.</p>

    <li><strong>Is the full ecosystem of your project agile; Agile Teams

    have has some feedback that this is overly critical, that many organisations
    get value even within "bureaucratic, linear, delivery". I don't disagree
    that they have gotten value, I just disagree that it is agility. One of the
    key tenants of agility is feedback, and the sudo-feedback of pre-production
    is no substitute for real feedback from real users that are using your
    system for production activities.</small> </li>

    <h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>I want to be clear that in the new state of modern practices that
    continuously adapt to change everything will change. Every business process
    you currently have is built on the bureaucratic ideas of the past! They are
    impediments to being able to effectively take advantage of market
    opportunities as they arise. This type of change is not something that you
    can buy-in from the outside, it take time, focus, and effort. It must be
    organically and iteratively grown from the inside. You may hire many
    consultants, or coaches, or trainers along the way, but they must be driving
    your vision and work for you.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>You as the leaders in your organisation need to come up with your vision
    for the future, some checkpoints that would indicate progress towards that
    vision and lead your organisation forwards. Along the way you need to
    continuously inspect your vision and checkpoints for validity and adapt as
    needed.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Inside out is the only effective way to change. It can not be imposed
    from the outside by folks that don't understand your culture or your people.
