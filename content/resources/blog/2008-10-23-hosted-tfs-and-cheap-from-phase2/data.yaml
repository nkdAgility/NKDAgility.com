These guys host lots of useful things and the had obviously decided to host <a title=\"Team Foundation Server\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx\">TFS</a> as part of their offering.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is a really great site, I regularly send posts to our staff!\_ You may want to check our site [www.phase2.com] for our version of hosted TFS.\_ We also integrate directly with our MS Project hosted application.\_ We have our own internal team of developers and offer TFS at a mere fraction of what TFS Now sells it for.\_ And no contracts.\_ We would be honoured if you would either review our service or mention us.</em> </p>\n<p><em><strong>Kevin Doherty</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agreed to review their service, but I would like to point out that I am getting nothing in return :( I am doing this just for fun.</p>\n<p>The guys over at Phase 2 provided me a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.phase2.com/hosted_team_foundation_server_overview2.aspx\">TFS server</a> and I was surprised at both how quickly they came up with it and how fast it was. The worry was that they would be providing a cut down version, like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://codeplex.com\">Codeplex</a>, but it is fully featured and has Reporting Services, Sharepoint and Analytical services. I tested Excel reporting (now Microsoft's recommended method, RS is dead, yippee) and customizing Work items. I also had a few question that the team over at Phase2 answered:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q. You quote 10 users as $1,299.00! Is that per month?<font color=\"#808080\"> (Stupid question I know, but it was not specified on the site.)</font></p>\n<p><br />\n<em>A. Yes, this is a per month charge that includes training, support, and backup.</em></p>\n<p><br />\nQ. What is the backup offering with your service? </p>\n<p><br />\nA. <em>Standard offering: We back up all client data every night [incremental] and full backups once a week.\_ We store 3 weeks’ worth of full backups. This schedule can be adjusted but additional costs may be involved.</em></p>\n<p><br />\nQ. Can you provide a multi server package, for example if I had 1000 developers and needed to run SSRS, SSAS, Sharepoint and TFS on multiple servers? </p>\n<p><br />\nA. <em>Yes, we will provide dedicated services and offer custom bundles.\_\_ A standard single-server deployment for TFS is good for about 100 users, beyond which we'd need to move to multiple front-end servers with at least one backend data-tier server.\_ We are scaling up from blade arrays to very powerful IBM x-series 4- and 6-way servers (all running virtuals, of course) over the next few weeks so we don't yet know what our upper limit is going to be per server.\_ For a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would certainly apply.</em></p>\n<p><br />\nQ. What about TFWA, and WIWA? </p>\n<p><br />\nA. <em>We do support TFWA, but the client must have an account in TFS.\_ WIWA is something that we can install upon request, but do not by default (For simplicity).\_ No extra charges for this additional functionality.</em></p>\n<p><br />\nQ. What is the disaster recovery turnaround? </p>\n<p><br />\nA. <em>24 hours maximum from time of notification.\_\_ Keep in mind that this depends on what the \"disaster\" is and when it gets noticed.\_ If the disaster is that someone within a client's organization deleted all or part of a project but no one noticed for 8 weeks,\_ we could recover the environment in short order but not necessarily the data (see backup comments above.)</em></p>\n<p><br />\nQ. Can I bundle TFS with a full environment? TFS + MOSS + Exchange + Communicator? </p>\n<p><br />\nA. <em>Absolutely, and again, for a custom bundle such as this, economies of scale would apply.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, a fantastic offering. It should be pointed out that I was using a http connection to the server and not https, but I am sure that it will be available. The costs are very reasonable and a lot better than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tfsnow.com/\">TFS Now</a>, which I was going to compare to, but alas their site is down at the time of writing.</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS\" rel=\"tag\">MOSS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS\" rel=\"tag\">TFS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint\" rel=\"tag\">SharePoint</a>\_</div>"

      Confused about the answer to the scale question.  Multiple Front End
      Servers in TFS2008 - they don't mean multiple AT's do they ??<br /><br
      />Interested to hear how it plays with a build server (either on your site
      or theirs) - especially if unit tests etc are included in your build and
      also if you want to install a Microsoft TFS Proxy Server at your
      offices.<br /><br />Great to see hosted TFS taking off despite all the
      technical difficulties in providing a hosted TFS offering with TFS2008. 
      Hopefully TFS2010 will make life easier for them.  I wish these guys the
      best of luck. <br /><br />Let us know how you get on once you have played
      with it for a bit.<br /><br />M.

      It is not clear, but I think they mean that they would provide multiple
      team servers with a single database server. You could do this with
      multiple instances if SQL on the one box...<br /><br /> Not sure though...
