    <p>It has been 25 years since Scrum was first created by Ken Schwaber and
    Jeff Sutherland and it has gone through many revisions. The last major
    revision was in 2017 and this update represents a simplification for
    2020.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>New updates include simplified
    language, less prescriptive and emphasis on the Scrum Team and its need to
    be self-managing</p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>It's very clear that Scrum has not changed! Ken &amp; Jeff have just
    found better ways to describe Scrum to simplify the story as well as reduce
    the cognitive load of interpreting it. </p>

    <p>There are lots of awesome changes so let's see if I can highlight the
    things I noticed the most:</p>

    <ul><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Teams
    are self-managing</a> - Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the
    members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are
    also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and
    how.</li><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Team is
    accountable for creating a valuable</a> - The entire Scrum Team is
    accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint. Scrum
    defines three specific accountabilities within the Scrum Team: the
    Developers, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master.</li><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">The
    Product Goal is a commitment for the Product Backlog</a> - The Product Goal
    describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the
    Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The
    rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the
    Product Goal.</li><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">The
    Sprint Goal is a commitment for the Sprint Backlog</a> - The Sprint Goal is
    the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a
    commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact
    work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus,
    encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate
    initiatives.</li><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-definition-of-done">Definition
    of Done is a commitment for the Increment </a>- The Definition of Done is a
    formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality
    measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item meets
    the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.</li><li><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#sprint-planning">The
    What, the Why, and the How of Sprint Planning</a> - The Product Owner
    ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product
    Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal. The Scrum Team may also
    invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.</li></ul>
