  - "As a fellow agilist, you’ll know that agility is critical to success in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous 21st-century\_marketplace.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because it empowers us to run experiments, frequently inspect, and regularly adapt. That’s how we navigate complexity. That’s how we create value, despite uncertainty, regardless of the industry or environment we serve.\r\n\r\nHow much Tupac have you got? How skilled, competent, and capable are you in navigating the competitive landscape we find ourselves in? What sets you apart from the pack?\r\n\r\nSuppose you’ve watched Twitter and Facebook let go of thousands of employees and Amazon dropkick thousands of executives into touch. In that case, it’s because organizations are walking into a deep, dark, hard recession and are looking to cut back on people who aren’t clear about the value they bring to the table. People who might be good at executing basic orders but aren’t great at innovating and creating value.\r\n\r\nPeople who aren’t in touch with their Agile, powerful, creative selves.\r\n\r\nSo, if you’ve brought your CV to HR and it sounds like Shania Twain’s 20-year reunion for ‘that don’t impress me much!’, maybe it’s time to upskill.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s time to combine everything you have learned since we last saw you for a Scrumorg course and build on that rock-solid foundation with a certification and skillset that does bring HR and hiring managers to the yard. I know the certification is valuable, but it’s what you’ll learn that it’s infinitely more valuable. What you’ll be capable of doing with these skills, models, and practices will set you apart.\r\n\r\nWho knows, maybe that creative prowess extends into creating your own business or product? With our Applying Professional Scrum and Professional Scrum with User Experience (UX) courses, you’ll be flexing something fierce and demonstrating why you’re the most valuable employee/colleague/start-up partner of 2023. Remember to apply your alumni discount at checkout to capitalise on the benefits of being a naked Agility fan.\r\n\r\nYou’re welcome.\r\n<h2 class=\"null\">Upcoming Training Classes</h2>\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a>\_if you don't find what you are looking for or would like a private class for your organization.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"10\"]\r\n\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a>\_if you don't find what you are looking for or would like a private class for your organization.\r\n<h3 class=\"null\">Recent Blog Posts</h3>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-NewsletterBlogPostList\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\r\n<h3 class=\"null\">Recent Videos</h3>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-preview\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"1\"]\r\n\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h3 class=\"null\">The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts</h3>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-preview\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"1\"]\r\n\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h3>What Classes are Right for you</h3>\r\n<strong>Everyone</strong>\_- Working in an evolving company\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Scrum Masters</strong>\_- Courses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Developers / Scrum Teams</strong>\_- Courses to help all members of the Scrum Team improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Product Owners / Product Managers</strong>\_- training to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<strong>Managers</strong> - Manage Scrum Teams indirectly.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<em>Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization.</em>"
