  - "Welcome to this month's edition of NKDAgility.\r\n\r\nIn today's fast-paced, rapidly changing world, agility has become more important than ever. The ability to quickly adapt to new situations, pivot when necessary, and continuously improve is key to success in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nIn this edition, we will explore the importance of agility in today's world and how it can help organizations stay competitive and achieve their goals. We’ve selected a few of our most loved articles and videos on Agility and hope you find it valuable in your own journey towards agility.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>The difference between traditional and empirical approaches\r\n</strong>If your organization has become successful using traditional and project management approaches, it can be difficult to understand why change is necessary. In short, traditional approaches work just fine if you’re working in a simple or complicated space – such as building bridges or roads. You know how to do the work, you know all the variables, and you have a fair idea of how long it will take and how much it will cost to get the job done. In complex environments, everything changes, and you need a new style of working if you’re going to build products that customers love and outcompete innovative competitors. That’s where Empiricism comes into its own. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains the difference between traditional and empirical approaches.<strong>\r\n</strong>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyJzSwU74Q&amp;ab_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood[/embed]</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Overview of The Scrum Framework with Martin Hinshelwood</strong>\r\nScrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum Framework is made up of five values, three Accountabilities, three artefacts, and five events.In this video, I'll go through an overview of each one, explaining what they are for and why they are there. The focus will be on the process itself, and we will leave the complementary practices until later.[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Fo3sM6BVo&amp;ab_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood[/embed]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Community</h3>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/community/\">Lean-Agile Practitioners Community</a> has grown to over 1300+ members, and new usability updates by our platform team will hopefully make it an even bigger success this year.\r\n\r\nIt's free to join the community, and our students get access to the <a href=\"https://community.nkdagility.com/spaces/5799644/feed\">Professional Scrum</a> space for 1-on-1 Coaching, The Situation Room, &amp; Tails from the Trenches!\r\n\r\n<em>Thank you very much to all who are making this community more extraordinary. </em>\r\n<h2 class=\"null\">Upcoming Training Classes</h2>\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"]\r\n\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Our Trainers</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"]\r\n<h2>What have we been up to?</h2>\r\nA short list of out blogs, videos, and webcasts!\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Blog Posts</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-NewsletterBlogPostList\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Videos</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h2>What Classes are Right for you</h2>\r\nAll of <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/\">our classes</a> are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are, or would like to be!\r\n<h4><strong>Everyone</strong>\_- Working in an evolving company</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Scrum Masters</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Developers / Scrum Teams</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help all members of the Scrum Team improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Product Owners / Product Managers</strong></h4>\r\ntraining to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Managers</strong></h4>\r\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<em>Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization.</em>"
