    meta_value: "Jim is a Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) with Scrum.org. Also, he holds a variety of certifications in Kanban, SAFe, LeSS and other practices (there are probably even some expired Microsoft and VMware certs somewhere in his basement, next to the vintage action figures and copious amounts of books). A self-described “Catalyzing Consultant,” Jim enjoys helping people, teams, and organizations of all sizes take a more humanistic approach to work in the spirit of getting more valuable work done. His approach could be described as pragmatic, hands-on and strategic.\r\n\r\nHis interests run the gamut, but he has a particular passion for board gaming, coffee and making things from wood and metal with his 3D printer, lathe and CNC. He also picked up the jigsaw puzzle hobby during the early days of COVID, and there is usually a puzzle (sometimes two) in progress somewhere within easy reach.\r\n\r\nJim is also the co-host of the popular podcast Mastering Agility; more details are available at MasteringAgility.org."
