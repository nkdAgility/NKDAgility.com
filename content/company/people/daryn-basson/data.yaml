    meta_value: "\"The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.\" - Robert Greene, 'Mastery'\r\n\r\nI started working part-time at the age of 11 at a restaurant up the road from my gran's house and I loved it. Everybody is super happy to see you when you're the guy with beers and burgers on a tray, and I loved earning money by creating memorable experiences for others.\r\n\r\nThose formative years in the service industries - as a waiter, barman, and river tour guide - have always shaped my thinking about connection, experience, and the power of story in shaping perceptions, actions, and outcomes. Context.\r\n\r\nOver the next 25 years as a professional sales | marketing specialist - and the past 8 years incorporating design and writing into those overarching skill sets - I've built on that initial platform and learned a great deal from working with progressive clients in challenging and competitive markets.\r\n\r\nThere's some awards I'm proud of, revenue targets that have been hit out of the park, and a few trips and spills along the way to mark the steep learning curve. I've earned valuable skills in the crucible of the sales and marketing arena, and I've earned some scars that mark the errors in 'trial and error'.\r\n\r\nI've learned along the way that not all artists carry brushes and paint pots, some create masterpieces from the blank canvas that is their business, profession, and passion. These are the people I'm drawn to, the people that inspire me, and the ones that fuel my own mission and purpose.\r\n\r\n\"To connect people, ideas, and opportunities through the power of story. Influence. To combine curiosity, grit, and critical analysis in my quest for mastery. Learning. To champion the phenomenon that is my clients, people, and animals. My tribe. Impact. To be the catalyst for evolution that powers progression. Creativity. To be both guardian and accelerator of purpose, wealth, and abundance for people and animals. Empowerment.\""
