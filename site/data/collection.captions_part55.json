    "description": "Unlock the power of evidence-based management to enhance agility! Discover how data-driven strategies drive market success and organisational growth.",
    "captions": "Evidence-based management has improved agility by actually having some way to monitor whether we're making changes to the organization. I think one of the core problems that we've had is that there hasn't been any real metrics. If you look at the research out there on agility in any form, whether that's plans or SAFE or DAD or LeSS or Nexus or Scrum, whatever it is you decide to do, in general, organisations are not being successful by implementing those things. They're not making systemic changes to their organisation; they're not getting the benefits that they expected to get. \n\nPart of the reason that is true, that they're not getting the benefits, is that they're focusing on the wrong thing. We're focusing on delivering the agile, which is not the point. The point of this is having a successful business that delivers value into the market so that we increase the value of our organisation. That's what we're trying to achieve, and agile is just a set of tools and practices and capabilities that we can use to help us be better at that. But unless we focus on what it is that we're trying to achieve‚Äîbeing more successful in the market‚Äîwe're not going to get the benefits from agile because we're not going to make the changes in our organisation that we need in order to be successful.\n\nWhen you look at organisations that are hugely successful at agile in the market, they're using agile. They've monitored what's going on in their organisation, and they've changed things in their organisation: the way their organisation functions, the way they do business, the way they lead people, the way they manage people, the way everything in their business operates. Every process, every service, every workflow has been impacted, and they've made those changes based on the data that they see. They're able to make a change in the way they do their business and monitor that data.\n\nEvidence-based management practices, even without using those terminologies, is how every successful organisation has become successful. Then we get complacent once we get to a certain size, and the organisation quite often stagnates. Every startup that ends up being successful is using an evidence-based approach. Every organisation that is continuously growing‚Äînot necessarily through the acquisition model, which is a different model‚Äîbut growing through their ability to deliver is doing that based on looking at the data, making the right decisions in the market, and expanding. \n\nThis is how you scale an organisation: you use the data to figure out what's next. Evidence-based management just quantifies that and says, you know, just looking at revenue is not a good idea. What about markets we haven't tapped yet? The unrealised value? What about the ability to innovate? Because if we continuously just deliver stuff, at some point we're going to get slower and slower at delivering stuff. If we want to maintain our ability to deliver stuff into production‚Äîhopefully the right stuff‚Äîand maintain our ability to deliver stuff, we need to be continually making sure that our ability to innovate and our time to market is of a manageable size. \n\nThere's balance in this framework of unrealised value, current value, ability to innovate, and time to market that enables you as an organisation to make better decisions, to focus on the right things for your business to be successful. So forget about the agile piece. Evidence-based management is about how you adapt your organisation to be more successful, how you enable your organisation to deal with the surprises that come along in the market. They could be good surprises or bad surprises, but when things happen, how quickly can your organisation take advantage of that surprise or mitigate the cost of that surprise? \n\nThat ability to adapt is what people are trying to quantify when they talk about agility. So really, evidence-based management is the thing that helps your organisation be successful in the market.

    "description": "Discover NKD Agility's unique training approach with Martin Hinshelwood, empowering the next generation of Agile practitioners to thrive in complexity.",
    "captions": "So in addition to our mentoring and consulting programs, we also provide training. The purpose of training is to teach those underlying theory and principles with actionable practices that people can use. And that's kind of why I do scrum.org based training, because their philosophy around training is about understanding the core theory and principles. Like, here's the first principles of what it is we're trying to achieve. Then building on top of that, here's the thing, right? So you're learning the thing, and then what are the additional processes and practices, complimentary processes and practices that can be used on top of that to do more, to get the value out of it that people are expecting to get.\n\nAnd one of the main reasons I liked scrum.org was because of that story, because of the community of trainers, the people that it gave me access to, to discuss and collaborate on how do we understand these things, how do we communicate these things, how do we enable them to be as effective as possible within organisations. But the two-day training format that was pre-pandemic was really good for the trainer, right? Because you fly in somewhere, you do two days training, and then you fly out. But not so good for the customer, because if you've got a bunch of people who are struggling to deliver value in your organisation and you spend two days teaching them scrum, where's the rest of that story? If they're still under pressure after that two-day class, then how are they actually able to do anything, to action any of those things? \n\nAnd time goes by, and then they've forgotten most of what it is that they've learned. That's why I think they say only 10% of things you learn in that format actually stick. Right? So you put 20 people through the class, they all remember a different 10% of the course because it's what matters to them or impacts them. They maybe implement 2% of that, so you get a 2% net gain of knowledge from that two-day class. But if we change that format up, this is why we've moved towards the immersive learning format and incorporating it into a bigger mentor program.\n\nEven if that 2% was all that was true, you're then getting 2% compounded over multiple sessions. Right? So rather than having two full days, let's say we did eight half days, right? So we've got eight half days over a longer period of time. And even if we still got that 2% actionable change, we get 2% and then compound it with another 2% and then compound it with another 2% because there's a gap in between and there's an assignment for people to go do inside the organisation. But I believe that that format is a heck of a lot more than remembering just a 10%, because we're only learning a couple of hours' worth of stuff. We're not learning 16 hours' worth of stuff and then you have to try and remember a percentage of that 16 hours. \n\nWe're remembering from that two hours' worth of stuff that we've researched and talked about and collaborated on to understand that teaching part. And then they have to go and try and apply something in that context within their organisation. And yes, everybody's going to learn, still going to learn something different. People are all going to retain different things. But even if it was again just learning the 10%, it's 10% of two hours plus 10% of two hours plus 10% of two hours. So the end percentage for the same learning content is much more powerful, much more effective, like orders of magnitude more effective for organisations. \n\nBecause they get the assignment to go try and do things within their organisation during that time, they've also provided actionable value for the organisation. So think of it like that iterative process in scrum where we do a sprint and then we deliver usable working product. We've got a learning exercise, then at the end of that learning exercise, they go deliver usable working product within the organisation. They just need to figure out what is the use. You know, we give them an assignment, but it can be quite vague, right? We give them lots of different ways to resolve that assignment. They pick something, they try it in the organisation, they've made a change. That change either was successful or it wasn't. It was either able to be implemented or it hit a roadblock. \n\nAnd then when we come back around, we're able to debrief that activity that they did, so they then get feedback and engagement, closing that feedback loop. Right? On how, you know, what did you manage to change? How effective was it in your organisation? What roadblocks do you hit? How do you get past those roadblocks? What have other people tried? And even especially when you put a big group through that within your organisation, you even get cross-pollination and cross-learning because one person or one group within the bigger group says, \"We weren't able to do that because this doesn't work in our organisation.\" And the other group is like, \"Well, actually, we were able to speak to this person and this person and get this to happen, so we were able to do this, which got us halfway there.\" \n\nAnd that cross-pollination and learning is hugely important to that story, and it works great across organisations as well when you have multiple organisations participating. So that's moving towards that immersive format. So we kind of started in the two-day format, we then moved into the four half-day format, then into the eight-week immersive format, and now moving into the kind of more mentor program, maybe over eight to 50 weeks of that program, with sessions and workshops and different things going on. I think this is the game changer for organisations because we're not just giving you the information, we're collaborating and working with you to help you implement it over a longer period of time."

    "description": "Discover why training is essential for managers transitioning to agile leaders in a complex world. Join Martin Hinshelwood for insights on thriving teams!",
    "captions": "[Music] Most managers today are just expected to be leaders as well. They're given no training, no direction; they're just magically supposed to come up with these skills themselves, and that's just not always the case. There are exceptional people that don't need any additional input of knowledge; they're able to go off and find out all of this stuff themselves and put it into effect. \n\nBut most of us benefit from a little bit of a helping hand. So we have the Agile Leadership class, which focuses on a manager transitioning into that servant leadership idea, where they're providing services to the team. They're enabling a team to be effective at the organisation level. So that's somebody who is learning how to delegate, learning how to hire the right people, learning how to connect the people doing the work with the outcomes that we're trying to achieve. All of those things are part of the Professional Agile Leadership class. \n\nBut in addition to that, as a leader, it's important to understand how the changes that we're making in the organisation benefit the overall organisation, increase the effectiveness of the overall organisation. For that, we have the Evidence-Based Management class as well, where we're looking a little bit more deeply into how we measure people, what the impact of those measurements are, and how can we maximise the effectiveness. \n\nAnd how do we measure that? Right, that's effectively what it is: how do we measure that? And so it's very important that we understand all of those things as a leader in an organisation, so that we can make the right choices and know for sure that we're making progress in the right direction. Because we've designed a bunch of measures that are unique to our product or our organisation to help us see whether we're making progress towards the overall outcomes that we're trying to achieve. \n\nMost managers and leaders don't measure those things. They don't have a holistic understanding of where the organisation currently is, where the organisation's currently going, and how we're going to measure that progress towards it. And really, those two things are part of the key focus of both the Professional Agile Leadership class and the Evidence-Based Management class, to help leaders gain additional skills on top of the awesome ones they already have, to help them be as effective within the context of Agile as possible. \n\nIf you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility dot com. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you."

    "description": "Discover how to recession-proof your business by investing in people and processes. Learn Kanban strategies to boost effectiveness and thrive, not just survive!",
    "captions": "I always find it interesting when in a recession or potential recession or market instability, right? Whatever your story is in your country, we talk about this idea of cost cutting and organisations divesting themselves of things they believe is waste. Like we've seen Capital One get rid of a lot of agile coaches and scrum masters, and even though they didn't really, because they're still hiring agile coaches and scrum masters, lots of other organisations have kind of done a lot of those cost cutting measures. \n\nActually, they're shooting themselves in the foot. They're absolutely shooting themselves in the foot. They're disadvantaging themselves in the face of other organisations that don't do that, that do it differently. Probably the best analogy I remember, I have done a little bit of marketing in the distant past or remember from university at least, is that the best time to invest in marketing is when sales are down and the economy is not so great. \n\nBecause the benefits that you reach on the other end are the payday, right? You have to put in the investment, put in the time when everything's booming and everything's going on. You don't need a lot of marketing to do the business that you want to do. When everything sucks, you need to do more to get what's there, right? Because everything sucks and there's not enough to go around. \n\nSo those that invest in sales and marketing during a recession are the ones that are more likely to be successful coming at the other end. The same is true for agile and let's call it business agility rather than the big A word, whatever we want to call it. I want businesses to be able to effectively take advantage of market opportunities when they arise, right? \n\nAll businesses exist in a volatile market. There are very few non-volatile markets. Today, there are very few non-volatile markets. Maybe diamonds, I don't know, that's maybe a non-volatile market. I don't know much about it, but it feels non-volatile. But all of the markets that we're all going to exist in, if you're building software and products, I have a good example in oil. \n\nOil and gas, if you're in that volatile market, when things start to suck, that's the time you should be investing in your efficiency, your productivity, and your effectiveness, right? Those are the times when you should be investing in those things. Because part of it is you get a little bit of breathing room, right? Because if there's not a lot going on in the market, like the market starting to stagnate a little bit, then you've not got that clamouring for new features, and it gives you time to get your house in order, to reorganise, re-evaluate what's going on. \n\nBut we tend to focus purely on the numbers, right? Because a lot of organisations have shareholders, and shareholders want their cash. So we can either not pay the shareholders this quarter and reinvest in our company and our people and our organisation, or we can fire 500 people and give the shareholders this higher yield than they were expecting, right? And lots of organisations opt for that second one, and that is shooting yourself in the foot. \n\nThat is revenue extraction over value creation. We want to be focusing on value creation because long-term value creation is what builds an effective business. It's how your business was built in the first place. So we want to be focusing during a recession on effectiveness, productivity, and all those lovely goodies. \n\nSo in the boom times, we tried all the things, right? Anything that came along, \"Oh, we've got cash for it, let's do that.\" \"Oh, we've got cash for this, let's do that,\" right? Because we've got a lot of cash. We're affluent. When we start moving into the opposite of boom, bust, I guess, when that bubble pops or deflates, right? It could just be deflating a little bit. \n\nThen we need to focus on our own effectiveness. If we can become more effective, we can do more with what we've got, and that means that we'll be the ones in the market innovating and adapting to the changing market more effectively. Does that make sense? If we start firing lots of people, we're going to have an unhappy workforce because people are unhappy when their friends get fired or other people in the company because they get scared. \n\nThen there's fear, and they don't want to do stuff, and they're like, \"Holy crap, what's going on?\" So unhappy, afraid people don't do good work. By having those layoffs within your organisation, you've created a culture of fear, maybe unwittingly, and maybe some of it's necessary, right? But you've created that culture of fear, and the people that are in there are not going to be serving the customers' needs as well because they're fearful. \n\nSo then customers are more unhappy with what it is that you're doing, and you get that vicious cycle. Lots of organisations end up in a death spiral at that point, and you just know they're going to disappear. It can be quite difficult to recover from some of those things. \n\nSo what we do when the bubble starts deflating is we start focusing on our effectiveness. How do we ensure that we're able to maximise the amount we're able to deliver? If you think of this, this is my market line, right? Above the line is the market, and then the people that are doing the work are here, and all the way down here is the CEO, who's not really connecting with the market, right? \n\nThe market, the people in your organisation are connected directly to the market. They're the ones that we want to have as effective as possible and dynamically shifting to whatever market opportunities come up. Because the more opportunities we're able to take advantage of within that market space, even in a recession, the less impact it's going to have on our overall business, especially if we're doing lots of small experiments, which can be risky. \n\nBut also, without risk, you don't get the bonus, right? If we're able to adapt to those changing needs as much as possible, as quickly as possible, then we, as a business, are more likely to survive. We're just more likely to survive if we're able to adapt to those changing market needs. \n\nI want to quote Satya Nadella here. I have a little quote up here: \"There cannot be a more important thing for an engineer, for a product team, than to work on the systems that drive our productivity.\" So I would any day of the week trade off features for our own productivity. I want our best engineers to work on our engineering systems so that later on we can come back and build all of the new concepts we want. \n\nThat is the epitome of this idea, right? Although from an engineering perspective, because Satya has an engineering background, right? If we, as a business, have slicker, more effective processes, minimised processes, right? You want to have systems in your business that are based on principles, not rules. \n\nIf you have rules, everybody will follow them, and they don't need to think. If they don't need to think when a market opportunity comes along, they follow the rule, not the market, right? Because they're not thinking. They need to follow the rule. But if we have a system based on principles, then the people within it need to think. \n\nWithin the bounds of those principles, they take advantage of market opportunities as they arise or other opportunities or different ways of doing things in order to be successful. So this idea of boom and bust, of non-recession and recession, is when things are going badly, the thing you want to be investing in is your people and your organisation and your practices and processes and making things more effective. \n\nMore effective is really important. A lot of people in business talk about productivity, and productivity is important, but I think effectiveness is that nuanced version of the word productivity. Because we could be highly productive, we're delivering lots of stuff, but are we delivering the right stuff, right? \n\nI know that this is basically me nitpicking the word, right? But effectiveness includes, are we building enough of the right stuff? These are the types of things that we need to invest in. That doesn't mean that you have to go and invest hundreds of thousands in scrum training or Kanban training or coaches or scrum masters or any of those things. \n\nYou want to figure out for your business in your market, right? Because remember, you were in that volatile market. What help and support do the people that are interacting with the market need in order to become more effective? Now, sometimes that is going to be training, right? Do they understand the theory and principles behind this? \n\nWe think this might help those teams. Let's train them in this. We're not going to make them do that, right? For example, let's take scrum as an example. We're not going to make them do scrum. We want the people that are doing the work, that are engaging with the volatile markets, to choose to be able to choose the best approach based on the principles that we base our organisation on. \n\nSo in order for them to choose the best approach, best within the context, right? Most effective within the context, they need to have the knowledge and skills and understanding necessary to be able to make those decisions. So this is where actually you also don't go and hire one of the big consulting companies to come in and do it for you, right? \n\nYou could hire a Boston Consulting Group or McKinsey to come in and say, \"This is how you're going to do everything.\" But the people in the system didn't learn. The way humans learn is by doing. We learn more by doing than by just talking about it. So in order to learn what works and what doesn't and how much it works and how much it doesn't, we need to actually do and try the things. \n\nSo you need the people within your system, right? That's the people that work for you in your company. This is your people. They need to be the ones that do the work. They need to be the ones that learn, that become the practitioners that understand those processes, practices, tools, principles, theories, right? \n\nSo the theory of constraints, you might be talking about scrum theory, you might be talking about first principles for all of these things. They need to be the ones that understand it so that they're able, within any context, to make the best decision possible, right? To make the best choices possible within the system of principles that we build around our organisational structure. \n\nThat means that you're probably going to be doing a lot of training. You're probably going to be bringing in experts on specific topics to help engage with people inside the organisation. But generally, you probably don't want to be doing that wholesale, right? Because what's right for one part of the organisation might not be right for another part of the organisation. \n\nSo what I think is an effective way is to let the people that are doing the work decide who and what they need. I work with a company in Spain. There are kind of two sister companies that are kind of the same but different. They give every single one of their employees a budget for training and consulting, right? \n\nSo every employee, I can't remember how much it was, let's say it's ‚Ç¨5,000. Every employee has ‚Ç¨5,000. So if you've got a team of five people, that's ‚Ç¨25,000 to spend on training and consulting. It's their budget. They can spend it how they like. They can get together and bring in some kind of coach. They can get together and bring in maybe they want a scrum master for a little while or somebody specific, right? \n\nLike you want somebody who focuses on sprint goals and value, and there's people out there that focus on engineering practices and DevOps, right? So you could bring in an expert for a period of time to participate with the team, and it comes out of their budget. They're the ones making the decision, and that means that because they're making the decision, they care about what that person they've chosen to bring in has to say. \n\nThis is the whole thing of other people don't care about your goals, right? They care about their goals. So the way you enable more effective organisations is either you make their goals your goals, or they make your goals their goals, right? So we all have to be going in the same direction. What is it we're trying to do? \n\nPrinciples and goals, strategic goals, intermediate strategic goals, those are the things that help us move together in the same direction as a distinct company. When we put all of that together, we're then able to be more effective. We're able to deliver more value. We're able to adapt as needed to the changing circumstances, right? \n\nSo as a team or group inside of your organisation decides they need some help with something, they can just bring that help in. It's not hard. There's not a bunch of procurement hoops, none of that crap, right? That just gets in the way. They're able to just bring in those people, get them to help them with that story, make it a little bit better. \n\nWhat's the next problem we've got, right? We need this other person to come in and help with this little bit, make them a little bit awesome, right? What's next? We maybe don't know what's next. Maybe we bring in a generic expert who's able to say, \"Oh, maybe you should try this, this, and this.\" \"Oh, that's a good idea, let's try that.\" \n\nThey're able to do all of those experiments, build that story of effectiveness that works best for them, and each area within your organisation is able to do that. Concentric circles, all interacting with the market. \n\nSo ultimately, it doesn't matter whether you're in boom or bust. This is how you want to focus on maximising your chances of weathering that storm. All markets deal in surprise. It doesn't matter what markets you're in, there are going to be surprises. A recession is just another type of surprise. How effective is your organisation at dealing with those surprises?"
