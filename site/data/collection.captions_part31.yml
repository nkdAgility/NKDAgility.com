  captions: Technical debt is not just a cost; it's a missed opportunity. How much money are you leaving on the table because you haven't had the ability to tackle those opportunities? You haven't had the ability to try those things. This is fundamentally why having a high-quality, usable, working product on a regular cadence is a superpower for your teams and for your organisation in your ability to deliver value.

  captions: |-
    One of the things that a new product owner needs to understand is that there's a lot of their job which is about marketing. You're going to be marketing the vision that you have in your product to the people doing the work, to the people consuming the work, and to the people paying for the work. They might be different people. They have to buy into your story. They have to engage with what it is you're trying to do, and ultimately they need to engage emotionally with that story. That's what marketing is all about: how do you enable people to engage emotionally with what it is you're trying to do so that they're following with anticipation what it is that you're trying to do? That's how you get people engaged in your story.

    One of the key issues I see in organisations is the great difficulty that product owners, especially new product owners, find in getting your stakeholders to turn up for your Sprint reviews. Right? Often times it's hard, even if they do turn up, to get them to provide you with feedback. Right? You ask them for feedback and all you can hear is tumble weeds rolling through the desert. Right? You're trying to engage them and they're just not getting there. And that's, to me, a marketing issue. They don't understand the value of what you're showing them. They're not emotionally engaged in what you're showing them. If they were emotionally engaged, they'd be desperate to sneak into that discussion and provide that feedback, provide you with more information. And that is part of marketing. You need to figure that out: how do you get into that story?

    We talk about it in the Professional Scrum Product Owner only a little bit. I talk about it more in the course, where does... So, I like this topic, but also we talk about it a little bit more in depth in the Advanced Product Owner because we start talking about the visionary and the collaborator and the different aspects of the product owner. And that's where it starts to matter a little bit more when you get a little bit more advanced. But marketing is that piece that enables you to sell your story and your conversation to the other people that are involved in your product and maximise the value that you're delivering.

    Because all the people funneling, providing input to your funnel, that results in your product backlog, that results in the value that you're delivering as you release to customers. Everybody's following the same funnel rather than buffing against it with friction because they're all going in different directions. Is your leadership of your organisation, are your members of your team, are your customers all aligned in where you're going and what you're trying to achieve? That's your job as a product owner: to figure that out.

    If you find it hard to enable this engagement with your stakeholders and get them into your Sprint reviews, my team at N Agility can help perfect your ability to do that, or we can find somebody who can help you. Don't let these sorts of issues inhibit your ability to deliver value. That lack of feedback at the review kind of sucks. Use the links in the description to get help as soon as you can.

  captions: |-
    I've written bad code and shipped it. That's not technical debt; that's incompetence. Right? So, within the context of a competent team, there's known technical debt and unknown technical debt. But there's another thing that we call technical debt, which is just shipping bad code, making poor choices, knowing that they're poor choices, and not doing anything about it. Right? Shipping bad code. Stop shipping bad code would be the way you pay that one back. 

    But for technical debt, you need to pay it back. You need to prioritise paying back that technical debt. Think of it more as an unhedged fund rather than a debt like a credit card. Most debt is secured against something, secured against an asset. If you stop paying your mortgage, then the bank comes and repossesses your house and gets their money back, right? And maybe you get some leftovers because you've paid some of your mortgage.

  title: 'The Future of Scrum Training: Immersive Learning for Lasting Change'
  description: Explore the future of Scrum training with immersive learning! Discover how it enhances understanding and implementation in complex environments.
  captions: |-
    So I believe that immersive learning is the future of, I think, almost all of this type of learning. Whether it's Scrum or Kanban or anything where people are involved, you've got a high degree of complexity. This is different from tools training, right? Different from tools training. But anytime you're talking about processes and practices that people have to organise around, I think the immersive learning approach is much more the future of the way that learning should be happening.

    It's very difficult for people to spend two days or four half days in a class and then be able to go back into their organisation and actually change something. It's very difficult because they'll go to try and change something in their organisation and they'll run into all of these roadblocks, all of these things that get in the way, and there's nobody there to help and support them because, you know, we did the training a couple of weeks ago and now we're doing this, and we run into those roadblocks.

    So the immersive format allows people to keep coming back around and having those questions, having them answered, especially the longer immersive stories. So they last six to ten weeks, and collaborating around with that group of people, bringing those learnings back to the organisation. This is a total game changer for the learning experience that people get when they come to these types of classes.

    So definitely, the future of Scrum training is immersive. If you want to have a discussion about how immersive classes can revolutionise your training experience, then please book a call on our website. Alternatively, you can find all of our public immersive classes listed there as well, and we would love to hear from you.

  title: PPDV course overview with Dr Joanna Plaskonka
  description: Join Dr Joanna Plaskonka for a quick overview of the PPDV course and discover how to enhance your product discovery skills! Register now!
  captions: |-
    Let's start with the why. Why was the PPD V course created? Based on our observations of how companies work and how teams work, it seems there is still a lot of attention when it comes to delivery. One may also think that, hey, if we have to put just one goal of every sprint, what is the most important thing that we have to achieve? It is creating a product increment. Done. Product increment. 

    So, it seems this is an important topic, right? But this is not enough, and I believe we forget, although we emphasise this a lot, that we are solving complex problems. What does it mean? We, along this product development journey, will make a lot of assumptions. What is even worse, some of those assumptions, in some cases, I would dare to say even the majority of them, might be made unconsciously. 

    So, we made an assumption, we take the next step, but we miss a learning opportunity. This may lead us to the feature factory problem. Of course, we have a lot of memes and stories like, "Hey, strong stakeholders, stakeholder-driven development," and here we go, we have the feature factory problem in place. But if we think about it deeper, there might be a lot of factors affecting this problem. 

    Maybe we have insufficient user understanding. Maybe we believe that what our users say is the truth. Well, this is what they say, but guess what? Do we really understand what the need is? Do we have all the data evidence to find the best ways to bring solutions to fulfil users' needs? This is a valid question. 

    Maybe we are facing reactionary development. Okay, customers want it because competitors did it. Is it really so? That's another question. Maybe we are facing insufficient collaboration with our stakeholders, and this is not the healthy collaboration. And maybe we have chosen the wrong metrics. We have a misalignment here. All those things may cause the problem that we call the feature factory problem. 

    So, what do we want to do with this course? We want to emphasise the topic of assumptions in the complex world. In the complex environment, we don't know many things. In fact, in many cases, we don't know what we don't know yet. So, that's why this path towards creating high value, towards creating valuable products and solutions for the customers, should be some kind of way how we navigate around assumptions. 

    Our biggest question is: what works best for the user? To find the answer with the knowledge gained in that course, we will embrace that. In fact, a full end-to-end empirical cycle requires discovery, delivery, and validation. So, those three elements work together to help us navigate around those assumptions. 

    Our new course is designed for product leaders, product owners, product managers, but also for product teams in general. We believe that everyone involved in the product development process will benefit from this class. This class is designed to be a one-day course, so around eight hours, which can also be split into two half days or smaller chunks. 

    In this class, we will use a case study that will help us navigate through different concepts throughout this whole story, how to better incorporate discovery and validation into the product development process. Thanks to that, we will get familiar with working with assumptions, experimentation, collecting evidence, and an important word for this class: learning. 

    So, it will be a conscious learning process on how to build better and better products.

  title: How to Achieve Predictability in Business through Agile Principles
  description: "Unlock business predictability with Agile! Join Martin Hinshelwood as he explores strategies to overcome challenges and drive consistent success. \U0001F31F"
  captions: |-
    Businesses want predictability. Predictability enables them to focus on achieving the outcomes that they desire in a consistent way. It reduces uncertainty and helps them achieve their business goals. But predictability is hard to achieve. There are all sorts of things that get in the way of us having predictability as a business. 

    Now, the things that we can't avoid that get in the way of predictability are things like market volatility, the changes in the market, and the unpredictable nature of the world and the ecosystem in which we're in. These are things we cannot control, so we have to include that in our story. But there are a bunch of things where we get unpredictability that we can control, that we can do something about. 

    Having clear goals or unclear goals causes unpredictability. Operational inefficiencies create unpredictability. You don't know how long things are going to take because everything takes a different amount of time to go through the system. Really having an undefined system—if you don't have a description of how things go through each of your systems—you could have many systems in your organization. Then how do we know that each thing that goes through each system is going through it in a consistent way, which enables that predictability? 

    All of those unpredictabilities, those frictions to our ability to do stuff, and inconsistent frictions to our ability to do stuff will impact on the performance of our organization. It will impact on revenue growth, it will impact on profitability, and it will impact on our ability to be competitive in the market. 

    The role of agile in this story, the role of agile in enabling predictability, is in the application of the ideas. It's a lot about changing from rules to principles. Instead of having a bunch of rules that people mindlessly follow, have a bunch of principles under which the folks that you have within your organization can make decisions. Define the systems that you have and how you want them to work—not just as leadership telling people how to do it, but the people that are doing the work defining the systems. That's pushing responsibility down the organization to the people who are actually doing the work. 

    Agile, or the mindset of agility, the agile philosophy, is about enabling people in our organization to improve the predictability of our business outcomes by improving the predictability of the things that they do. I think one of the difficulties is that most organizations, most people in organizations, are not looking at predictability metrics. They're not looking at the data that indicates instabilities in the system. Those are the things that you want to control, where you want to make changes. 

    This whole idea of increasing business predictability is not something that just randomly happens. It's not something that just installing agility in your organization is going to result in an increased level of business predictability. It's something that is systematic, that is deliberate, that requires effort and consistency of application over a longer period of time to start making the changes, moving the needles to increase the level of predictability within your business. 

    There's a myth that I see all the time in organizations at every level: that because we're doing agile, we can't plan or predict what's going to happen. We can't do estimates, we're not supposed to be looking forward too far into the future. All of that is kind of bunkum. The fundamental principle of agility is about minimizing the amount of work you do until it needs to be done. 

    We don't want to do documentation that is going to change frequently unless we need that documentation in order to understand what we need to change. We'd be better building some product, right? Build some product, test it in the market, and get into those tight feedback loops. That's one of the key things that I find that organizations really struggle with within the context of predictability: they don't close the feedback loops. 

    So if you're looking at what you're doing within the context of agility, this myth that you can't plan for the future is just that—a myth. The poster child for agility is Microsoft's transition in the last 10 to 12 years. They do planning looking forward over 18 months. The granularity is really high level, but they do plan over 18 months. They do a season-based model and they plan for 18-month seasons. There's nothing wrong with that; there's nothing anti-agile about that. 

    But it's the way that you do it. It's how you implement it. Is that 18-month plan something that is enshrined in "this is what we're going to do"? How changeable and malleable is that plan over time? How much effort do you spend on that plan versus doing the work that you need to do just now? Those are all things that belay this myth that you can't plan or predict because you're doing agile. You absolutely can; you just use different tools and techniques to achieve that. 

    There's a really famous quote: "Plans are irrelevant; planning is everything." That's the key to success within the context of business predictability. If you want to increase the predictability of your business, you need to stop creating plans and start planning. What is it we're going to do next? Where do we want to go? What do we want to achieve? If we're answering those questions and then communicating it effectively within the business, we can enable a level of strategic alignment with everybody in our organization. 

    If you look up "team" in the dictionary, it says a group of people working together towards a common goal. How can we do that if we don't have that common goal? A goal is a single thing; it's not a whole bunch of things. So what is it that your business is trying to achieve that you want everybody and every product and every effort to align behind? For a particular product within the context of that business, what is the thing that you want everybody working together towards? The outcomes of that product should align behind the product's goal, the vision, the strategy. 

    These are things that are commonly missing in organizations, and that creates a fragmentation of effort. The effort that people put in is in a direction of their choosing—each individual on the team's effort of their choosing, each manager's effort of their choosing, each leader's effort of their choosing, each product owner's effort of their choosing. How do we enable us to be all working together towards that common goal? That requires planning to gain predictability. 

    We're not really talking about risk mitigation as a document; we're talking about risk mitigation as a holistic strategy for our organization. We're not talking about resource management at the individual level; we're talking about where our investment opportunities are as a business that fit inside of our strategic goals and strategy. 

    This whole idea of planning to gain predictability is to enable your business to have a competitive advantage in the market against other businesses in the same market. Naked agility can help you increase your business predictability by enabling you to do that. We can't come in and just provide you with increased business predictability. You need to do that; it's your business, it's your organization, it's your department, it's your team. 

    The only people that can help you increase that predictability are you. We can bring our knowledge and expertise of what has worked in other organizations. We can bring ways and tools for analysing the data—what's the current state of your system—helping you define your system so that you can then see where the problems are that are reducing your predictability so that you can fix them. 

    One of the big things we bring is visibility, so that you can see what's going on. If you can see what's going on, you can make tweaks to the way you do things. You can help the people that you work with make tweaks to the way they do things to hopefully increase that level of predictability within your business. 

    Now, that can be data-driven. We can look at data for team morale and capability. We can look at data for knowledge and skills. We can look at profitability of the business and where we're spending the money. These are all data-driven approaches. We can then help bring frameworks and methodologies—ideologies, philosophies—what are things that are holistic to all businesses that can enable you to look at things in a different way to be able to see what's going on and make those changes. 

    Perhaps Scrum is a good idea. Perhaps Kanban is a good idea. Perhaps lean thinking is a good idea. Perhaps Lean UX is a good idea. There are all sorts of tools, frameworks, and ideas available that have been shown to work in many different sorts of businesses that we can try and analyse to see if it works for your business in your context. 

    What we're offering is a completely custom solution for your business that doesn't make you like somebody else's business. One of the things that I commonly see as a negative consequence of going and working with a large consulting organization that brings a standard methodology and practice and then applies it to your business is that you become like every other business that they've applied it to. 

    One of the things that made your business successful was its unique ability to take advantage of a niche that you've built in a market. Your business grew to take advantage of a niche, and if somebody comes along and applies their business practices or their system on top of it, then you're just like every other company that uses that same system. 

    A great example is road hauling. If you're moving goods around, those businesses are fairly standard. But businesses that use the same tooling as every other business that does the same thing are just the same business with a different owner or a different manager. They're not different; there's no differentiation in the market. They're just filling that market. 

    How do they open new markets? How do they ingeniously solve problems in interesting ways that help them adapt their business towards a new niche or new capability or open up new markets? They can't because they're working within a structured system that doesn't allow them to explore other opportunities. 

    What we want to do as a business is come up with our own way of moving from whatever it is we're doing now towards a greater degree of agility so that it's our business processes, it's our unique way of doing things to fill that unique niche. If you look at every single commercially successful organization that has adopted agile practices, especially agile practices at scale, you'll see that every single one of them has created their own system that fits the way they want to do business and is shaped by the way they want to do business. 

    They're not just installing somebody else's system. That's why Microsoft uses the season-based model, Spotify has their way of doing things, and Google has their way of doing things. Every single one of these organizations has a unique way that's bespoke to them of solving this problem of how do we increase our business predictability and our ability to serve the markets within which we're in. 

    It's pretty hard to describe what it looks like, sounds like, or feels like once you're on this journey and you've made some progress towards a greater degree of adaptability and a higher degree of predictability. It's going to impact everything in your organization. 

    Microsoft is often asked, "What changed?" When you made these changes and adaptations to your business, what changed? The answer is usually everything. Everything changed. The way they do financing changed, the way they do business changed, the way they find new customers changed, the way they manage customers changed, the way they build the products has changed, the way they engage with the people who build the products, and the way they engage with the outside world has changed. 

    Every part of their business processes has changed in their entire organization. Now, that's a little bit of an overestimation; not everything has changed. They still have their journey, and they've not addressed some things that they probably could address. But they've done a good job of tackling some of those big things. 

    A great example you can go look up is the change in the way they measure bonuses for salespeople. It used to be that they were measured based on the amount of Azure time that they sell because Azure is the big selling feature. How much do you sell? But now it's on usage. If you measure how much time they sell, the salesperson gets the customer to clinch the deal. They're a closer, and that's who you want as a salesperson. 

    Then the customer has paid the money, and the salesperson gets their bonus. But the problem with that is what happens at the end of the year when the customer hasn't used the thing they've paid for, and it expires? They bought a year’s worth of stuff, and they've used 10% of it. Now they're annoyed and angry that 90% of their funds have been wasted. 

    If you switch that around to usage, the sales folks get their bonus based on usage. They then need different skills; they're not a dual closer. This is an example of a little tweak in the way a business functions that has a massive impact. The perfect salesperson is no longer a closer; they're an enabler. They enable your company to help this customer use the service more and more. 

    For example, perhaps the closer brings in an expert to bamboozle the customer with all the cool things that you can do, and they close the deal, and they're done. But what the enabler does is bring in, perhaps out of their own budget, external consultants and helpers to help over a longer term enable that customer to use the services more. 

    Now we're talking about what enables you to use your more agile transition. DevOps—all of these things mean that you need to consume things more quickly, and it benefits both parties. It benefits both Microsoft because they get to sell more Azure, and it benefits the customer because they're able to adapt to their market needs more quickly and more effectively. 

    What does it look and feel like? It looks and feels like everybody working together towards a common goal. We're not working against our customers; we're working with our customers. We're not working against each other; we're working with each other. That is the superpower that brings this whole story together. 

    It changes the behaviours of people in your organization. It changes the organizational culture. It changes the experience that both employees and stakeholders have, and it changes the way that you measure success in your business. Everything will change if you embark on this journey. 

    At the end of that journey—it never ends, but once you've made some progress on that journey—you will have more predictability in your business and a higher ability to take advantage of market opportunities when they arise because you're then able to deal with surprises. You've got that level of predictability.
