  title: Product Management Mentor Program Final

  captions: |-
    The product management mentor programme for software development is really a programme to allow companies that are building software products to build better software products. There's a huge gap in the way organisations approach software development and software engineering and building those types of products where when we start transitioning, they realise that the work is so different and so complex and different all the time that the kind of more common ways of managing projects like you might for building houses or building bridges is just not going to work. 

    Um, because everything's so much more complex. So they try and shift from those old ways of working where you have Gantt charts and plans and milestones and deadlines and they try and move towards agile, right? Whatever people are calling it locally, they move towards that story and they don't, they take away those milestones and Gantt charts and traditional project management tools, right, that are supporting that story. They take those away and then they don't replace it with anything and they wonder why it doesn't work out, right? Things start to go wrong fairly quickly. Things go off track. We're not going in the right direction and it's because they're missing a piece of that puzzle and it's a pretty big piece of that puzzle and it's vision, value, and validation. That's what's missing. 

    They don't have what, um, if you go look up in the dictionary, it's a group of people working together towards a common goal. So if you want people to work together towards a common goal, whether they're an individual team or they're your whole company, you need to have that common goal that they can all get behind and they can all follow, that they all understand, that it's been communicated effectively. 

    And what I see in a lot of organisations is they'll maybe communicate at once, they'll maybe set directives and they don't involve the people that are part of the story, the people that they want to follow that goal. And the reality is that people don't follow your goals, they follow their goals. So in order for you to engage with all of the people in the organisation, the people in the software teams building the software, the people in the legal department, in cyber security, and all of those different parts and have us all working together towards that common goal of building and delivering this product to customers that's going to maximise the value means that we all have to be going in the same direction. 

    We all have to understand the same thing, right? What is it we're trying to achieve? And that is one of the main focuses of the product management mentor programme. We're talking about tools and techniques, we're talking about theories and principles and practices that help us understand why those things are needed and how we get everybody moving in the same direction. How do we, as product managers, enable not just to communicate that direction with the people within our organisation or outside of our organisation as well to involve those stakeholders and those customers in the story? 

    But also do we, how do we measure whether we've been successful, right? How do we bring in things like evidence-based management, right? Looking at our whole product and are we moving in the right direction? Are we looking at the right numbers? Do we have the right measures to be able to figure out where we're going? Looking at things like hypothesis-driven engineering practices, right? Why are you adding this feature? What would you like the world to look like after this feature has been delivered? What would you expect the difference to be? How are we going to measure that? 

    Building that whole story into the way we build products so that we can maximise the value that we deliver to the business for the return for the money that they've put in.

  title: My journey with Kanban and why I actively recommend it to clients.
  description: Discover my Kanban journey and why I recommend it to clients! Learn how it enhances workflow, transparency, and predictability across all industries.
  captions: |-
    I got introduced to Cban by Daniel Vante and Steve Porter when I did the participated in the first professional Scrum with Cban class back in 2018, late '17, early '18. I didn't fundamentally understand at the time the value of this different way of thinking, of this observational tool. I think it's quite important to understand that Cban is not a system itself. That's why Pro Cban and the Cban guide talks about it as a strategy. It's a strategy for understanding your existing system and then actively managing the flow of work through that existing system.

    We talked about it in that context, within the context of a Scrum team, and how we can actively manage the flow of work within the system, use the Cban metric to augment our existing, perhaps awesome, Scrum process in order to really understand the predictability that we're getting and increase that predictability for the business. Because lots of teams do struggle with their ability to deliver. They struggle with getting to the end of the Sprint and having working product. They struggle with consistently getting working product. They struggle with the quantity of working product, and that creates fear in the business because the business are paying a lot of money to get stuff, and they feel like they're getting that stuff in fits and starts in an unpredictable way. They feel like it's not what they asked for, it doesn't cost what they thought it would, and it's not delivered when they thought it would.

    Part of that is because they can't see what's going on. We're not giving them any information. The standard Scrum team is not giving the business any information to reassure them. They're not doing transparency right. They're not increasing the transparency to a level where the people viewing who need to understand actually understand what's going on, and that creates that fear. That means that we want to have more control. When we fear something isn't working out, when we fear that our money isn't being spent well, we want to take more control of that thing. That's the knee-jerk regression that we get from a lot of teams in organisations when a lot of teams move towards Scrum because they take away some of the tools for measuring productivity from the teams. 

    Because in Agile, we don't measure productivity, they take that stuff away, but then they don't replace it with anything. Because they don't replace it with anything, transparency drops, fear increases, and then we want to go back to the old way. So a Cban strategy, and this is something that I've learned really over the last five years of working with Daniel Vante and the Cban guide and Pro Cban, is that the only way to be successful is to use a Cban strategy. Because we need to understand our predictability, we need to understand and actively manage the flow of work through the system, and we are not going to be successful if we don't do that. 

    So I recommend a Cban strategy for any team doing anything in any context. That's right, any team doing anything in any context. If you're a marketing team delivering marketing content, if you're a software team delivering software and you're using Scrum, you're a software team using SAFe, you're a software team using something else that you made up yourself, or you're a management team managing a portfolio, or I don't know, I'm trying to think of other things. If you work in a factory and you're delivering stuff, you should be using a Cban strategy in all of those contexts. That is the metrics you need in order to then be successful. 

    Because those metrics create transparency. Transparency allows you to make better decisions and ask more interesting questions, and those interesting questions and better decisions result in more effective flow or stop doing the thing that you thought of. That's why Cban is so important to the strategy for every team building anything in any company. If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.

  title: Does Kanban integrate into a Scrum environment?
  description: Discover how Kanban enhances Scrum with essential metrics and insights for better project visibility and predictability. Elevate your Agile game today!
  captions: |-
    The question is, does Cban integrate with a Scrum environment? And I want to be super clear: Cban integrates with any environment, any way of working, whether you're doing Scrum or you're doing Waterfall or you just made up a way of working. All of these things can benefit from the application of a Cban strategy.

    Right, the Scrum in particular doesn't have any metrics. There are no metrics in Scrum. Go read the Cang guide; there is no mention of velocity, no mention of story points, no mention of time, no mention of any of those things. The only thing that's about as close to a metric as the Scrum guide talks about is it says that the team should have discussions to understand the size of things that are in their backlog. That's it, right? How you define that size, all of those things are up to the team. Teams generally pick things like story points and velocity, and unfortunately, those metrics have damaged our ability as an industry—building software industry in particular—to have conversations with customers, have them understand what we're saying, and be able to actually answer the customer questions.

    It is absolutely unreasonable for a customer to come to you, has given you and your team a bunch of money, and says, "When will it be done?" and you say, "We're doing Scrum; we don't have an answer to that question." That is completely unreasonable, and if I was that person, I would say, "Fine, I'm not giving you any more money. I'll go find somebody else who can answer my questions," right?

    So, Cban—a Cban strategy—enables you to actually answer those questions, right? You're definitely not answering it with absolutes, right? Because that's impossible. We understand the cone of uncertainty; we understand that those difficulties. But we can start to use probabilistic forecasting—a fantastic tool, probabilistic forecasting—to help us answer those questions of "When will it be done?" or "What will I get by this date?" Right? These are such important questions.

    Daniel Vante, who's one of the creators of Pro Cban, the creator of the Cban strategy, who worked with Scrum.org to create the Cban guide for Scrum teams and H Cban for Scrum teams—of course, he has a book called "When Will It Be Done?" That's how important that question is to your business. You need to be able to answer that question: "When will it be done?" And the tools that Cban gives you, the metrics that you have to monitor, enable you to then get those answers to those questions very specifically, right?

    So, does Cban integrate with a Scrum environment? I think Cban has to integrate with a Scrum environment. In fact, Scrum is not as good without a Cban strategy. For me, this is a pairing that just has to happen. If you're doing Scrum, you should be using a Cban strategy. I don't really have any—what would you call it?—like, "Well, maybe you should use..." No, you should be using a Cban strategy. Everybody should—for every system, in every workplace, everywhere—you should be using a Cban strategy. That's how you understand the flow of work through your system so that you can make the optimisations, right? That's where you get the continuous improvement from when you're doing Scrum.

    Right? You have a retrospective. How do you know what optimisations you should make? How do you have conversations about what the problem is if you've got no data? How do you see whether the things that you've decided to try actually provide any benefit or not? You need metrics, and you need data. And story points and velocity and burndown charts are completely useless to answer any of those questions. Are we on track? Are we doing well? Do we need to improve? None of those questions can be answered with burndown charts and velocity. Don't even try; they're a waste of time.

    What you need is cycle time, you need lead time, and you need throughput. You need work item aging, and you need work in process. That's it. Those are the metrics that you're looking for. Those are the metrics that you need. If your current system of work is failing you, then you would benefit from creating and applying a Cban strategy. Our professional Cban trainers and consultants are ready to help. Don't wait; the sooner you start, the sooner you will improve. Get in touch below.

  title: The Cost of Chaos. The Impact of Poor Technical Leadership
  description: Discover how poor technical leadership fuels chaos in software delivery and learn to boost productivity through engineering excellence with Martin Hinshelwood.
  captions: |-
    Chaos costs money. Most organisations that I work with and have worked with really struggle with controlling the chaos within the context of delivering usable working product to their customers. They find that the work is substandard. We've got a lot of bugs hitting production. We've perhaps got a lot of rework happening because things aren't quite what we expect them to be or don't meet the minimum standard for our organisation, and we end up going down dead ends. 

    I'm going to need to explain that, but a lot of the time—and I do this as well when I'm building products—you try and figure out a solution to the problem you've got. Right? You've got a problem; you know where you want to get to just now, and you come up with a solution that gets you to that thing that you want to get to. But over time, that where you want to get to does in fact shift. Right? It could shift because of different market opportunities that arise, or it could shift because we're scaling. 

    We came up with a solution that was on par at the time, but now it's subpar. It doesn't, you know, it's slow. We're running into problems. We're having a lot of support calls because of technology choices that we made that are no longer valid. You see this a lot in the extreme in the airlines and car rental companies. Right? They have a lot of, I would call it, technical debt. The choices that were made at the time that they've never gone back around and refactored. 

    Right? So they still have mainframe systems, and they don't have people who understand the mainframe systems anymore. So they've got a double problem. Not only do they still have those mainframes, but nobody in the organisation knows how they work, how to reimplement them, how to manage them, or where to kick them when something goes wrong. And that happens all the time in technology. Right? The technology moves forward. 

    I work with lots of organisations who have solved problems in ways that made perfect sense at the time because there was no solution on the shelf out there that you could go get. I've got one customer that built their own source control system because they started developing software 30 years ago, and 30 years ago, building software at scale, there weren't very many options for source control systems. The ones that were out there maybe didn't fit their needs, so they created their own one. But today, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Right? There are plenty of good source control systems out there. Git is the de facto standard, and they should have all of their code, all of their systems on Git. 

    But you need to invest time and money to move from what you had before to what you need now, and that's part of this story of technical leadership and engineering excellence. We need to be focused on ensuring that our systems and processes that our people are using are as effective as possible so that their job is as slick and easy as possible. Right? Satya does good work on this at Microsoft. Right? He would rather people spent the best engineers, the most skilled people, spent time on optimising the systems that we have because then we can come back around and build all the features we want because we have these really slick systems. 

    And it seems like it's a cost, right? But actually, the slickness of these systems that control the chaos are a value centre because they are the thing that supports our ability to deliver new features. A great example is the Azure DevOps team. They, back in 2012, before they improved their systems, were delivering something like 24, 25 features to production each year with 650 people, with an application of technical excellence and effort. Right? This is not for free, and great technical leadership within the organisation. They took that from 25 features to production each year to over 600 features to production each year, and that difference was because they paid back a lot of the—I’m going to say technical debt. Some of it was technical debt; other stuff was technical cruft, just a buildup of, I don't know, sediment, a buildup of rust in your system because things get old. 

    Technology moves really fast, and we need to keep up with it. And because they made those changes, just one simple thing, they flipped from lots of long-running system tests to unit tests. It took them four years of effort to get there, but they took their engineering team's ability to see whether what they've done works from 48 hours down to 3 and a half minutes. Think what that would do to your productivity if you had to wait 48 hours to find out if the simplest change had been successful. You'd push bigger and bigger changes through the pipe. 

    So when you do have a problem, it's harder and harder to figure out what that problem is, whereas if you're able to find out if it works in 3 and a half minutes, you'll be running that all the time on the smallest changes you make, and you will build a better product that's more scalable and has less Band-Aids. Right? You're not out with the super glue and sticky tape trying to seal over the gaps for bad choices that you made because you didn't know that there was a problem. You didn't know it wasn't going to meet the standard. 

    So that cost of chaos is because of poor technical leadership and low engineering excellence. You might see engineering mediocrity within an organisation. You can solve these problems by having your best engineers, your best people, focus on delivering the systems, the optimisations to the systems that you need so everybody on every team has the easiest possible job adding value in your product.

  captions: |-
    The applying professional Cang course from Pro Caman is really that foundational class on understanding how to apply a cand strategy to your existing system. It doesn't really matter what your existing system is; you could be doing Scrum, you could be doing waterfall, you could be doing anything. Whatever process you've got right now is the process that you apply the Cang strategy to. 

    This course's purpose is to help you understand what is needed in order to have a Cang strategy and what are some of the starting points, tools, and techniques you can use to get started with a cand strategy. What's the minimum you need to be doing Cang right? 

    So, what are the minimum metrics we need to be collecting, visualisations we have to have, and decisions that we have to make in order for our continuous improvement to start happening? How do we start interpreting the graphs, start understanding the data, and analysing it in order to get better at whatever it is that we're doing? 

    It really helps improve the flow of value through the system. It helps you get an idea of what your current flow is, and that helps you figure out how to ask more interesting questions of your team. If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. 

    We have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.
