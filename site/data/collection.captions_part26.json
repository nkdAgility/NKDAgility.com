    "title": "Story Points: A Ghost of Agile Past",
    "description": "Uncover the hidden challenges of story points in Agile! Join Martin as he explores their pitfalls and advocates for a value-driven approach. üëªüöÄ #AgileChallenges",
    "captions": "There are a number of ghosts of Agile past that plague us and the first one that I want to talk about is story points. The person that originally created the idea of story points has publicly apologised for creating them. That should tell you something about story points. But ultimately, story points have been with us for a very long time. In the old, old, old days, people used to do a lot of absolute estimation. So things like hours, right? We used to figure out exactly how many hours this thing would take. This will take 5,000 hours. And then we would perhaps measure ourselves against how many hours it did take. And in order to kind of move away from that idea of hours and absolute estimation, a lot of teams started talking about relative estimation and relative estimation points in some way. And that could be t-shirt sizes I often hear, but the main one is story points. Story points have been with us probably for about, about 20 years. They've been plaguing, they've been haunting teams for about 20 years. \n\nAnd story points create a whole bunch of, wow, really difficult things with teams. So one of them is that you'll often see or hear teams having a conversation about how they claim points for the work that they've done so that they can push the rest of the work that they haven't done into the next sprint. That's pretty dysfunctional behaviour right? The point is not the points, the point is the value that we're delivering and that's what we should be focusing on, not some arbitrary set of points. \n\nWe also see teams being measured or compared across teams based on their story points. This team delivers 30 story points per sprint, this team delivers 20 story points per sprint, so this team must be better than this team and that is utter garbage. There is no way to compare story points across teams. There is no way, there is no normalisation algorithm that you can use to do that comparison or create it in some way. It's just one of those agile bullshit things that keeps sticking around we can't get rid of. \n\nSo the what was the other thing that story... Story... Oh! I recently engaged with a customer and they had a team that was struggling to deliver. It was actually five teams working on one product and they were struggling to deliver. And I was trying to figure out what the problem was and they kept going on about story points were the most important thing for them to progress and they had to get a specific number of story points. And this was a professional services organisation. And I found out that the contract that they had with the customer, obviously, somebody on the customer's side and somebody on their side had decided that it would be a great idea, because they've heard about these story point things, to put story points into the contract and they were contracted for an exact number of story points and if they were outwith a 15% deviation from the exact number of story points then there were fiscal penalties for the professional services organisation so you can imagine the raft of dysfunctional behaviours that resulted from that. \n\nI used to think story points were a good thing. I used to think they were a good thing. And now I'm a little bit more aligned with Daniel Vacanti on this. He's the Kanban, pro Kanban guy. Story points have set our industry back 20 years. Story points are one of the things that have restricted the ability for us to adapt to changing circumstances as we might have because there's that continuous focus on the numbers, continuous focus on the work that's done because story points reflect the work, not the value, right? Continuous focus on the work, the butts on the seats, rather than on the value that's created. \n\nSo I'm a firm believer in flow metrics moving towards, they're not the be all and end all, right? Because we can have awesome flow and we're delivering tons of crap into production, but at least flow is telling us what's really going on, right? We're looking at our cycle time, we're looking at our work item aging, we're looking at our throughput, right? Those metrics are just based on historical fact for what we're delivering. We can certainly manipulate them by reducing batch size, which usually has good outcomes. And I just find that they're all round a more useful way of looking at the data of, and potentially looking across multiple teams as well for a whole department, for a whole organisation. What is it we're able to deliver, what does that look like? But ultimately, moving towards more flow-based metrics and away from relative size estimation, I think is a good idea. \n\nAnd that's why I put story points in that list of ghosts of Agile past. And if you are being haunted by these ghosts of Agile past, we can help you exercise them or help you find a coach, consultant or trainer who can. Don't let these phantoms undermine the effectiveness of the value that you deliver. And the longer you wait, the more they're going to haunt your team's progress.

    "description": "Discover how adapting to change drives business success in our fast-paced world. Join us to learn key strategies for thriving amidst constant evolution! üåç‚ú®",
    "captions": "In order to be successful, we need to constantly readjust to our surroundings. Right? Things happen. If you're going through life and you meet new people, people disappear. Things happen in the world, right? Medical things happen. Winning the lottery happens. All of those things happen, and we as humans are default behaviour is to adapt around those situations. \n\nThe same is true for businesses, right? It's basically an ecosystem. Your business exists within a specific niche that it developed into. Your business grew into one or maybe many niches, depending on the size of your organisation. In those niches, things aren't constant; things are continuously changing. \n\nSo, in the old days, the niches used to be there for a really long time. They used to change very slowly. Right? So if you were a carpet manufacturer in Islington, then your market was fairly stable. Your competition was fairly low. But today, that's not true for any organisation. There are organisations which don't have competitive markets, but they are incredibly rare. You're probably not one of them. \n\nIf you exist in those highly competitive, highly dynamic markets, you need to be constantly adapting to the needs of those markets in order to maximise the value that you deliver to your customers and maximise the revenue that you create and profit that you return for your organisation. That requires constant adaptation‚Äîconstant adaptation to the market, constant adaptation to changing circumstances, constant adaptation to things that happen in the world that affect your business. \n\nI think that the great example of that is when COVID came along. If you were an organisation in March of 2020 that had already embraced the interwebs, right? You already had people working from home. You had already embraced modern security practices, so you weren't using VPN tunnels into a specific office location. Then you probably, if you were already in that modern camp, you probably had‚Äîand your business was largely either doing business, i.e. people working in an office‚Äîthen you probably had very little impact to your business from the work-from-home rules. Right? Because people could just go work from home, and it was cool. \n\nYeah, we had to deal with, you know, we lost some productivity because the kids were at home as well. Right? We lost some productivity because I don't have an office in my house, and I had to work on the kitchen table. Right? And there's things going on around me. But we adapted. Right? We adapted to those circumstances. We adapted to what it was we had to do, and we made it work. \n\nThat's the genius of humans. That's the thing that we're really good at. So you don't want to get in the way of that inside of your organisation. The way we get in the way of that is by creating rules. \n\nSo companies, organisational controls or boundaries or organisational boundaries should be maintained using principles rather than rules. If you use principles in the way you do business, i.e. a guiding principle, then you're not constraining people to the way we currently do things. You're leaving it open for people to choose different ways to do things. \n\nYou might have policies and procedures and rules, right? You might work in a regulated industry, and here's a bunch of stuff we have to do. But how you interpret those things should be fluid based on the needs of the market while still complying with the rules. \n\nThat is probably one of the hardest things for organisations to adapt to, is that old thinking‚Äîthe Industrial Revolution thinking‚Äîthat we can just create a bunch of rules, a bunch of ways that we work, and have everybody follow it, and we're going to continue to be successful. Those days were gone in the 1920s. They're completely eradicated by the 1970s. \n\nAll successful organisations continuously adapt. If you continuously adapt to your market, why don't you continuously adapt to the work inside of your organisation? What's holding you back from making that change? \n\nIf you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility dot com. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you."

    "title": "NKD Agility Consulting Approach",
    "description": "Discover the NKD Agility approach to effective Agile consulting and coaching with Martin Hinshelwood. Learn how to choose the right Agile partner!",
    "captions": "So there's no way for an external party to come in and give you a solution. Recipe is something that you can no. Recipe is the wrong word, but there's no way that somebody can come into your organization and just tell you how to do your stuff. It's the reason that the big consulting companies don't affect any change. It's the reason that the big frameworks for Agile or DevOps don't actually tend to change anything in the organization, apart from cost during your bank account. That's big consulting companies too. \n\nIt's the reason that most organizations struggle to incorporate the story that they're trying to work towards a new story, right? And the reason that they struggle is because they're trying to buy it in rather than adapt it. It's like if you wanted to be a gymnast and are you just going to hire somebody to do the gymnastics for you? But you wanted to be the gymnast. They're the gymnast; you're not the gymnast. \n\nSo there's a fallacy in consulting that a lot of consulting is just contracting, right? You're hiring somebody in to do the job. You've got a butt on a seat doing that job for you. And if that job inside of your organization is a business-critical job, which anything that's around the purpose of your organization, anything that's around how your business does business is critical to your organization, then you're outsourcing part of your organization. \n\nAnd now why would anybody in your organization learn how to do that thing? Because there's somebody else doing it who doesn't want to share it because they're a contractor. And if they keep that knowledge, they keep their job. If they share that knowledge, they lose their job. And that for me is the big difference between contracting and consulting, right? Although a lot of people sell consulting when actually they're doing contracting. \n\nAnd that's that. The purpose of a consultant is to provoke change. That's probably the most interesting way to say it. The purpose of a consultant is to provoke change. The consultant shouldn't be doing any of the work within your organization. If you hire a consultant, you're not hiring them as an Agile coach; that's a contractor. You're not hiring them as a development lead or a project manager; that's not a consultant; that's a contractor, right? There's somebody in your organization doing the work. \n\nWhat a consultant is, is an advisor who provokes change. They are somebody from the outside who maybe has additional deep knowledge and skills in that particular topic who doesn't come in to just tell you how to solve the problem. Even if they know how to solve the problem, right? They might give you advice, but they're not going to solve the problem for you. But they help enable you as the person inside the organization or group of people, if it's a team, to understand the theory so that you can make the decisions for the organization, so that you can make the changes in the organization. \n\nAnd because you understand the theory and the principles, you're able to then make the future decisions as well that are better than the previous decisions, if that makes sense. The whole idea of consulting is to help organizations change by provoking the people inside of the organization to do things differently."

    "description": "Unmask the burndown trap in Agile! Discover effective sprint planning strategies that prioritise value and adaptability. Watch now! üöÄ‚ú®",
    "captions": "A common thing that agile teams do is they use burndowns to figure out how things are going throughout the Sprint. I've got to say burndowns are agile banditry. The whole idea of burndowns, in order for a burndown to move from top left to bottom right in a reasonable linear fashion, you have to have planned the whole Sprint up front. Right? In order to have a project burned down or a product burn down moving from top left to bottom right, you have to have planned the whole product or project up front.\n\nHopefully, we can all be on the same page that if we're doing, if we're building products that don't exist yet, right? We're developing products that don't exist, then there's too much variance, too many surprises, too much complexity in what it is we're doing to really plan the next six months' worth of work. It's always going to change more than we would like. And if we look at data from like the Standish Group, that do the chaos report, for example, you'll find that 65% of things that we build change over the life of the product. And in fact, even worse than that, only 30% of the features that we do build are actually used by our customers. The rest are used little, if ever. Right? So that brings those two things together. We have a massive amount of unknowns in what we're doing. It's usually always more than 50%. So we know less than half of what we're going to have to figure out along the way. And that means that being able to plan up front, even the next 10-day Sprint, is just a ridiculous exercise in making stuff up. A ridiculous exercise in telling a fictional story.\n\nThe reality is you should walk out of Sprint planning with no more than is needed to get started. That's how big your plan should be. Getting started in the Sprint, how big should your plan be for your product? Enough to get started, right? Or enough to convince somebody to give you the money. That's also, you know, you might need more for that. But that ability to get started is all you need. So you maybe walk out of Sprint planning with 24 hours' worth of work. We've planned the next 24 hours because we're going to get together every 24 hours and plan the next 24 hours after that. So we don't really need more than the first 24 hours to get started. If we're going to build a product, we don't really need that much more than the first Sprint to get started. What of the backlog items we're going to do maybe during that Sprint? We can come up with, you know, how far out into the future we do want to look. But you want it to be minimal but sufficient. You want to have less stuff to manage, less stuff in these things. That's why burndowns are one of the reasons that you can't tell what's going on.\n\nThis is the banditry part of it. Being for bandits, it's that if I plan the whole Sprint, right? And I've got, let's say I've got five developers working on my product, and I've got five stories coming into the backlog, and each of those five stories has ten tasks that I'm going to write down as part of my plan. How many per person, right? How many tasks do I have at the end? I have lots and lots and lots and lots of tasks. What happens on day two of the Sprint when you figure out that your plan wasn't that great and 50% of it needs to change because you figured out something new? It gets out of date. And the reason it gets out of date is because none of your developers, they want to focus on delivering the stuff because we're under pressure to deliver the product, deliver the value. And yet they need to go and edit or manage these hundred things that are in the Sprint backlog. Right? Don't have them there. You don't need them. All you need is a just-in-time, just-enough plan either for the Sprint or a just-in-time, just-enough plan for your product in order to start getting started and get developing your product.\n\nSo don't get stuck in that rut of too much planning up front, which is what a burndown forces you to do. Stop being a bunch of agile bandits and focus instead on continuous flow of value through your system. If you are being ambushed by agile bandits in your organisation, then my team at Naked Agility can help. Or we can help you find a consultant or expert who can.

    "captions": "There's a quote: \"There's no such thing as an agile transformation; it's a cultural transformation.\" I agree with the part that says there's no such thing as an agile transformation. That's agile transformation, digital transformation, whatever transformation you want to call it. It's not really a thing. But I also disagree that it's a cultural transformation. \n\nCulture is not something you can change; it's not something you can affect directly. The culture is an outcome of the way you do things, the system, and the way the system engages people. People interact with the system, resulting in the behaviours that create the culture in your organisation. \n\nSo, the easiest way to think about it is: culture is just a shadow on the wall. Right? So if you want to change the shadow on the wall, do you try and change the shadow, or do you change you? You change your position, you change your shape, and then the shadow on the wall changes. \n\nIf you want to make changes to your organisation, if you want to change the way people act in your organisation, if you want to modify the culture of your organisation, you don't actually focus on those things. Those are not the things you change; those are the outcomes. You focus on the system that your organisation has. What are the rules? What are the procedures? What are the practices? What are the ways you measure people within your organisation? What are the principles upon which people make decisions in your organisation? \n\nWhen the rules don't fit, those are the things that changing will affect the way your organisation runs, the way it functions, and the way people act within your organisation, which is your organisational culture. \n\nSo, you can't really affect how people act. Well, there my dad's spinning on that one. But if you want to change the way people behave in your organisation, you're going to have to focus on the system. Change the system itself and tweak the system. Make changes; maybe it's small changes, maybe it needs large changes to the system. \n\nThen monitor the outcomes, which is the culture and the way people act and the behaviours that you see in your organisation. Then keep shifting the system to get the result that you want. So you need to focus on that system; you can't focus on the culture because you can't change culture. \n\nIf you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility.
