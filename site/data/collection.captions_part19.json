    "title": "Mastering Evidence-Based Management in Agile: Inform, Donâ€™t Control",
    "description": "Discover how Evidence-Based Management (EBM) empowers organisations to make informed, data-driven decisions that enhance outcomes and drive success.",
    "captions": "Evidence-based management is the application of evidence-based practices at the strategic and tactical levels in an organisation. It involves using data to inform but not control the actions and behaviours that have been shown to impact outcomes. So what that means is that we're going to collect a bunch of data within the organisation. The way we measure people informs the way they behave. So whenever you're working within an organisation and you find somebody's working against you or somebody's not being as involved as you think they should be involved, and you're wondering why, there's probably some organisational measure or metric something being levied against them that enables, ensures, encourages that behaviour in that person.\n\nSo the best way to figure out why somebody is doing something in a particular way that maybe you feel has a negative impact on the way your things need to happen is to figure out how they're measured. That can be difficult, but if you can glean that information, you can figure out why they're behaving the way they're behaving, why they're taking the actions that they're taking. We want to try and have more behaviours and actions that impact our outcomes positively. We want to deliver more value to our customers. \n\nWhat other outcomes might your business want? Well, they might want more revenue. They might want more value for their customers. They might want to save money. What else might be good impactful outcomes for our business? We might want to increase our capability within a particular market. It's difficult without a specific instance to have a specific outcome that you're trying to achieve. \n\nOnce you've figured out what your outcomes are, you need to figure out what metrics are going to help you measure progress towards those outcomes. These can be super tactical things that help you move towards those outcomes. It can be leading or lagging measures; there's all kinds of things that come into that. But evidence-based management is that application of practices within the context of that data to help you make decisions. \n\nOne of the reasons I very specifically said inform but not control is that the data is not always going to result in a specific action. For example, let's say I had a metric for my team or teams. I've got a group of teams I'm working with, and my metric is the number of live site incidents that last or exist for longer than two sprintsâ€”let's call it three sprints. We're running a live service; we're going to have outages and issues and things that happen in the live service. When those things happen, we're going to create live site incidents or live site incident mitigating actionsâ€”things we're going to change in the product in order to not have that type of live site incident happen again.\n\nSo we've done our analysis, we've come up with these ideas, and then we expect our metric to be that we expect teams to clear those off within three sprints. If I expect them to clear it off within three sprints, I maybe want to have a measure, a team dashboard, and I'm going to have a measure that says what is the number of live site incidents that have been existing for longer than three sprints and what is the trend of that number. Is it trending up or is it trending down? \n\nYou may see your list of teams, and you see the numbers, and they're all good apart from this one team that has these four outstanding live site issues that have been there for longer than, let's say, six or seven sprints. That doesn't mean there's something wrong in that team. These are indications, these are flags, pieces of evidence that you use to inform your decision-making. So you'll probably need to go ask them how it's going, and maybe there's a team that they're waiting on something else to happen. They can't fix their thing until some other third party that they don't control and we have limited influence over needs to do something. \n\nSo the team, that data looks bad, but the team's doing fine. They're chasing it on a regular basis; they're putting pressure on that other group on a continuous basis. It's just taking time to get resolved. That's why it informs but does not control. \n\nWe're making decisions based on the evidence. We're collecting a bunch of evidence; we're extrapolating what we don't know or don't understand. The evidence is going to have gaps in it, and then we're making an informed decision based on our understanding of the current situation. That's evidence-based management in a nutshell."

    "description": "Unlock the secrets of a successful product backlog! Join Martin as he highlights the crucial role of the Product Owner in Scrum. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¯",
    "captions": "So the question is, how critical is a product owner in developing a great product backlog? If you look at the Scrum Guide, then it will be absolutely imperative. They are the one that decides, makes the final decision, the arbiter of the product backlog. They are responsible and accountable for ordering the product backlog. Although they can delegate it, they're responsible for the contents of the product backlog. Although they can delegate it, they are 100% responsible for expressing and communicating the vision and strategy that results in all of those other things.\n\nSo if you think about what you might put in a product backlog, you're not going to know what to put in there unless you know what direction you're going. Product backlogs can quite often become just this massive dumping ground of whatever crap anybody asks for at any point in time, and that's not what you want. You want your product backlog to be a short list, a lean inventory of the work that needs to be done to maximise the value that you're going to deliver to your customers. This means if you have 5,000 things in your product backlog, you probably don't have a product owner. You've probably got somebody who's just dumping stuff in there, and if a customer makes a request, they just put it in there. Perhaps that's not the right customer request. Perhaps we should say no to that customer request. Perhaps we should ask the customer to keep it in their back pocket because it's not to do with our current strategy.\n\nAnd those are really the core critical activities of the product owner that help us create this lean, directional product backlog that enables then the engineering team, the developers, to select the right things. Because it's all understood, it's transparent, we know what trade-offs we're making as developers. We know what trade-offs we're making when we choose this over that. Even though this is more important, we know we have to do this that first. And those are the types of conversations that we can only have if we have strong product leadership, a strong product owner on our product, who's able to communicate and express that strategy and direction effectively.\n\nThanks for watching the video.

    "description": "Discover the buzz around our new immersive learning experiences for Scrum! Join Martin Hinshelwood as he shares initial feedback and future insights.",
    "captions": "So the initial response to the immersive learning has been incredibly positive. Almost every single pair, I can't think of anybody I've spoken to that have said, \"Well, that sounds like it sucks. I'd rather do a two-day class.\" Nobody said that. Everybody detests the full-time two-day workshop. I don't know why we kept doing it for so long. Actually, I do know why we kept doing it for so long. It's because we insisted on trainers going on site to do it, which means that you have to do it in a short period of time because the company that you work for doesn't want to pay for me in a hotel for six weeks and all the stuff that that entails in order to be able to deliver a six-week workshop, right?\n\nSo we need to compress it into a short period of time. Now, in the virtual space, we're free to experiment with different formats, different ways of engaging with students, and it's really resonating with the people that are thinking about taking the class or wanting to be part of it. We've already had customers express interest. We've had customers buy onto, especially the PSPO, which has been hugely popular because they're really interested in that continuous development, right? That conversation that you have over a longer period of time so that you're not just, \"Here's a bunch of content. Bye, that's it.\" That's a two-day class, right? This is more, \"Here's a little bit of content and here's something to try in your business. Go try it, come back next week, and let's have a chat about it. How did you get on? How did it work? What happened?\" \n\nThat piece, businesses, especially small to medium-sized businesses, really see that extra value that they get for it, for really not that much extra cost, right? It's spreading that out over a longer period of time, closing those feedback loops, getting people really embedding those ideas. Not, oh, my favourite expression that actually one of my good friends, Jim, mentioned is that a job as a trainer is to plant seeds, right? Seeds of ideas that are then going to grow into something. \n\nOne of the problems with the two-day format is you're planting a whole bunch of seeds and you don't know what's going to grow, and nobody's coming back to water those seeds or care for them, right? That's just self-service. You've seeds are on your own figuring out how to expand that, whereas this format is the gardener's coming back, tending all of the different plants, the different seeds. You know, if these plants in this area aren't getting enough water, they can spend more time on that, and that really gets those thought processes going. \n\nI'm really looking forward to these immersive classes.

    "captions": "So the question is, is the EPS immersive learning experience the equivalent of having a hands-on Scrum coach? No, but almost. I think is probably the right answer to that. \n\nHaving somebody with your team on a continuous basis is really helpful, right? Somebody to even, even Sprints later, who you're able to get advice from and engage with is really powerful. But we kind of almost do that with our immersive class, right? So what we do is, each session includes a feedback loop, right? The assignment you get at the end of the session to try in your organisation is then debriefed before the next session, so you're closing that feedback loop. \n\nThat includes a little bit of coaching, right? Because you're not just doing it; you're getting the feedback from it and getting coaching from the trainer slash coach who's able to help you with that. But also, it's over 10 weeks, right? Typical Sprint length is two weeks, so you actually get five Sprints' worth of help, and you're only taking one half day per week per Sprint out. \n\nSo that's one day, ten percent of your Sprints, right? In our two-week Sprint, that's ten percent you're losing, right? That's you're losing it as productive time on the team building your product. But hopefully, what you gain back in overall effectiveness of your team over five Sprints, right? Continually coming back, closing those feedback loops, trying something new. \n\nHow many retrospectives do you have in those five Sprints? You have five retrospectives, right? So you can get together as a team and each two weeks, each two sessions, figure out how much the training has helped you and bring that information to the next session so that the trainer can then adapt and augment the training based on the needs of you and your organisation on a continuous basis, right? That's super awesome. \n\nAnd in addition, oh, if that wasn't enough, right? The We Always Nickel Agility always offers an hour of additional coaching per person that's in the class, right? So if you're doing a 10-week, 10 weeks with us, with let's say 12 people in the class, the immersive classes are a little bit smaller, right? So you get 12 people in the class, you get an additional 12 hours of coaching and help. \n\nSo maybe that trainer comes back for your next two or three retrospectives. Maybe they sit in on, or even during that time, right? They sit in on our Sprint review and a Sprint retrospective and your some of your dailies, and you can close some of the more of those feedback loops, get more help, get that coaching as part of the scenario. \n\nThat is being delivered. That part is up to you, right? You have to want it because you have to use it, and you have to figure out how to include it in your process. But the APS immersive class is ultimately a 10-week, five Sprints, five Sprint kickstart for your organisation and moving towards Scrum or Kanban or whatever it is you're trying to do. \n\nThanks for watching the video.

    "description": "Discover whether an APS workshop or agile consultant is best for your team. Join Martin Hinshelwood as he shares insights on mastering Scrum for effective product development.",
    "captions": "Oh, so if a Scrum Master was battling with their team, would you recommend an APS workshop or an agile consultant? I may recommend a new Scrum Master, right? Because if the Scrum Master is battling with the team, that doesn't even make sense. They're there to help the team be effective; they're part of the team. If a whole team is battling with them, then that makes them the [ __ ]. Right? I think it does. I guess it would be circumstantial, but that's how I feel.\n\nWith an APS workshop or an agile consultant, be better. What I tend to do as an agile consultant is more of a coach, the coach, right? So I'm happy to be there, observe the team, maybe give the whole team advice if that's what's asked for. But I would tend to focus on observing and then coaching the Scrum Master. If the Scrum Master is battling the team, maybe that's not going to be effective, right?\n\nSo probably it depends on what the Scrum Master is battling the team over. So if the Scrum Master is battling the team, like the team, I, we, the team are objecting to doing things that could potentially benefit them, it's kind of let the team decide. It's meant to be a democratised process, not a dictatorship. So the Scrum Master can't dictate anything, but perhaps there's some value in helping the team understand more about what Scrum, for example, has to offer so that they have more ammunition to make a determination, and perhaps they'll make a different determination, right? Because if the team decides not to do Scrum, they probably shouldn't be doing Scrum, right? Because if you enforce it, they're not going to like it, they're going to push back against it, and you're not going to have a good time. It needs to be a chosen thing.\n\nSo what I might suggest is yes, an APS workshop, and treat it as a workshop, treat it as having fun, right, from their perspective. But also from my perspective, they're all going to bring the things, the reasons why Scrum can't work for them. So it's almost like a hybrid. That would, for me, be a hybrid situation where I'm going to run an APS, where I may run an APS workshop, but I'm going to treat it very much as a consulting gig that they do want some answers, right? They don't necessarily just want to understand APS; they want to understand EPS within the context of their company and their problems and their issues. Because there's no point in just teaching them Scrum if they're vehemently opposed to the idea of anything like that or anything being imposed upon them.\n\nSo probably approach it from that perspective, that we're going to use the APS curriculum as a way to shape the conversation and hit all of the things that we need to hit. But even at the end, at the end of the APS, I've mentioned this a couple of times because I just love this feature of the APS. After we've had those conversations, right, whether it's a standard APS where I've got a bunch of public students and we teach the class, they learn a bunch of stuff about Scrum, but we don't necessarily dive too much into their individual context, or if it's a private gig like the one that we're describing here, where we're able to spend as much time as we need on their stuff as well and understanding that link because it matters to everybody in the room.\n\nAt the end of the class, we have this session where we dive into what should you do, right? There's a number of little workshops that I can run with the group that's in the room that depends on what the group is. One of those is a kind of getting started with Scrum workshop. One of those is a tune-up, right? We're already doing Scrum, and we need to tune up our process. What should we look at? But we also first have a kind of set of questions to set them up, and one of those is should we use Scrum? One of the questions is what are the reasons we shouldn't use Scrum? What are the reasons we should? What will happen if we don't change what we're doing? Because those are important questions, not for me to answer, but for them to answer for themselves.\n\nDo they feel their current way of working is actually working? Is it actually providing value to the customer? If not, what are they going to do to change? We've just talked for four half days about a bunch of tools that they could use to help them change. Are they going to try some of those tools, or do they want to try something else? If you think those tools won't work, what needs to change in your organisation in order for that to be effective? And I think that's probably the way I would approach it, a kind of hybrid APS with some agile consulting in order to help the team make better decisions. And you know when to have a long chat with the Scrum Master if they're battling the team, right?\n\nThanks for watching the video. If you enjoyed it, please like, follow, and subscribe.

    "description": "Uncover the truth behind Scrum myths! Join Martin as he reveals the real purpose of Scrum events and why they matter in agile. ðŸŽ¥ðŸš€ #Scrum #Agile",
    "captions": "There's a myth in Scrum that you spend more time talking than doing. I see this quite a lot. People talking, usually people are using old school terminology. When you hear them talking about that, you hear them talking about ceremonies, right, rather than events. One of the main reasons why Scrum doesn't call the activities ceremonies is because it's ceremonies. We get together and nothing happens. It's a ceremony; it's something we do that's perhaps the same every time, and there's no actual outcome to a ceremony apart from maybe people have some jollies and they feel good.\n\nThe reason Scrum calls them events and also not meetings is something's supposed to happen there. Every single one of the Scrum events serves empiricism; that's their purpose, right? You're going to inspect something and adapt something. If you're not adapting, there's no point in being there. There's no point in having it; there's no point in doing it. Their purpose is to adapt.\n\nSo, for example, at your Sprint planning, you're inspecting your product backlog and your product goal, and you're adapting your Sprint backlog and your Sprint goal. That emerges through that conversation, right? But at the end of your Sprint planning, you should have a Sprint goal. You should have selected backlog items. What do the developers think best serves working towards the product goal? You should have some kind of a starter plan to complete them. If those three things don't exist at the end of Sprint planning, there was no point in having it. That's what it's there for, so that we understand what it is we're going to take into the next Sprint, so that we can communicate that perhaps with other people. What's our goal for this Sprint? What are we trying to achieve?\n\nHow do you get the stakeholders to actually turn up for the Sprint review? Well, you have to give them something that they're interested in coming and providing feedback on. That's your Sprint goal, right? And that's just one of the events in Scrum. Every single daily Scrum, it's only 15 minutes. How does that add up to a boatload of meetings? At most, 15 minutes per day where the team gets together and plans the next 24 hours. That's its purpose. You're inspecting your existing Sprint backlog, and you're adapting that Sprint backlog based on what you learned in the last 24 hours. You might have learned some stuff from actually working on the product, what can and cannot be done. You might have gained more information and insight from other stakeholders and collaborating with the business and doing analysis on what it is you're going to work on. That means that something that you've got in the Sprint needs to be taken out because it's no longer viable, or something else needs to be brought in because it becomes part of that story of what it is you're trying to achieve that Sprint.\n\nThat's your daily Scrum, right? It's not an elaborate status event; it's not a time that you're wasting. It's where you're maintaining the transparency that is required to be able to inspect and adapt. You're serving empiricism, and all of the Scrum events serve empiricism.\n\nThanks for watching the video. If you enjoyed it, please like, follow, and subscribe.

    "captions": "The question is, why is the Professional Agile Leadership Essentials class a kind of core evolution for a Scrum Master? I think, again, there are two great reasons. The first one is that it enables a Scrum Master to hear the questions that leaders and managers have about Scrum, about the context that we're talking about, right? They get to hear some of the other ways that it's important to them or that we can solve problems for them.\n\nBut also, I think of the Scrum Master as being the first rung on the leadership track, right? This idea that I call them kind of gold shirts, right? Like the Star Trek idea. You get people that are on the leadership track, and you get people that aren't really interested in the leadership track. There are loads of people out there who are quite happy being software engineers, right? They're quite happy being Scotty, running these engineering departments. They don't want to be in charge of the ship at all.\n\nSo, we need to be able to cater for both of those groups, and the Scrum Master is a natural position of leadership. They're a leader who serves the team. Then the next level up is the leader who serves a bunch of teams, and the next level up is the leader who serves a part of the organisation or the leader who serves the actual organisation, right?\n\nSo, that gives you that kind of leadership track of the organisation. For the Scrum Master, learning the language, the lexicon, the problems that the leaders see at those levels will help them better serve people at those different levels in the organisation.\n\nThanks for watching the video!
