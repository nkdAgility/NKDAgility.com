        "description": "# CI/CD Done Right: Engineering Excellence with Continuous Integration and Delivery | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I unpack the real meaning of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**—and why most teams aren’t doing it right. From mainline branching to ring-based deployments, I explore how CI/CD pipelines can help teams reduce risk, improve product quality, and achieve faster, more reliable releases. Let’s redefine what CI/CD should look like and how it can transform your development process.\n\n**📌 Chapters:**  \n\n1. 00:00 – Introduction: The Problem with “Fake CI/CD”  \n2. 02:30 – What Continuous Integration Really Means  \n3. 05:00 – Why Mainline Branching is Critical  \n4. 08:15 – Continuous Delivery: Shipping Directly to Production  \n5. 11:30 – Ring-Based Deployment Models for Controlled Risk  \n6. 15:45 – The Role of Automation in CI/CD  \n7. 19:30 – Adapting CI/CD to Fit Your Product and Business Goals  \n\n**🎯 Who This Video is For:**  \n\n- Developers and engineering teams looking to adopt true CI/CD practices  \n- Product owners and business leaders aiming to improve release frequency and quality  \n- Organizations struggling with complex branching models or deployment bottlenecks  \n\n**📖 What You’ll Learn:**  \n\n- The difference between automated builds and true CI/CD  \n- Why DevTestLive branches are outdated and risky  \n- How mainline branching reduces integration issues and supports continuous delivery  \n- The benefits of ring-based deployments for managing risk and gathering feedback  \n- Strategies for automating CI/CD pipelines to reduce costs and improve efficiency  \n- Real-world examples from Microsoft’s deployment models  \n\n**💡 Key Takeaways:**  \n\n- Continuous Integration means frequent merges into a mainline branch, not separate branch builds.  \n- Continuous Delivery ensures every commit is deployable to production, reducing deployment friction.  \n- Ring-based deployments allow teams to manage risk while iterating quickly.  \n- CI/CD isn’t one-size-fits-all—tailoring it to your product and goals is key.  \n\nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we specialize in helping organizations design and implement CI/CD pipelines that fit their needs. Whether it’s full automation, ring-based deployments, or just a reliable build system, we can help you optimize your processes and deliver better software, faster.

        "description": "# Shift Left: Building Quality In From the Start | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I explore the transformative concept of **shifting left** in modern software engineering. It’s about integrating quality, security, and testing into the earliest stages of development, empowering teams to build better products and avoid the pitfalls of technical debt. From test-driven development to pair programming, I’ll share actionable insights and real-world examples that demonstrate why shifting left is a game-changer.\n\n**📌 Chapters:**  \n\n1. 00:00 – Introduction: What is Shift Left?  \n2. 01:30 – Why Shift Left is Controversial  \n3. 04:00 – Owning the Code: Build, Test, and Support  \n4. 07:15 – Key Skills for Modern Engineering Teams  \n5. 10:00 – Tools & Techniques: Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming  \n6. 14:30 – Lessons from the Azure DevOps Team  \n7. 19:00 – How Shifting Left Impacts Productivity and Innovation  \n8. 22:00 – Building a Culture of Engineering Excellence  \n\n**🎯 Who This Video is For:**  \n\n- Software engineers and developers seeking to improve product quality and reduce technical debt  \n- Engineering managers and CTOs focused on scaling effective teams  \n- Agile practitioners looking to integrate modern engineering practices into their workflow  \n\n**📖 What You’ll Learn:**  \n\n- Why shifting quality assurance earlier in the development cycle improves outcomes  \n- The importance of engineering teams owning the entire product lifecycle, from development to production support  \n- How test-driven development leads to better architectures  \n- The productivity and innovation gains from pair programming  \n- Real-world insights from the Azure DevOps team’s journey to continuous delivery  \n- How shifting left minimizes production bugs, brand damage, and missed opportunities  \n\n**💡 Key Takeaways:**  \n\n- Shifting left empowers teams to \"build quality in\" rather than testing it in later.  \n- Practices like pair programming and test-driven development may seem slower initially but drastically reduce costs and increase efficiency in the long run.  \n- Paying down technical debt enables exponential productivity and value gains.  \n- Iterating quickly through small experiments creates better products that resonate with customers.  \n\nAre you ready to embrace modern software engineering practices and unlock your team’s potential?

Migrating to Azure DevOps, especially from on-premises TFS (Team Foundation Server), presents a key decision: fidelity versus flexibility. Do you migrate everything in one complete transfer, or selectively choose data sets based on your organizational needs? Each option offers unique benefits—and challenges.\n\nI'll walk you through the trade-offs, including how a complete database migration ensures higher fidelity but less flexibility, while selective data migration provides flexibility but requires replaying data, which may result in minor data loss. This video will help you understand the nuances of both approaches and how our tools can simplify and streamline your migration process.\n\nVideo Chapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction to Data Integrity and Azure DevOps Migration\n00:27 - Database Architecture: TFS to Azure DevOps\n00:51 - Full Database Migration: High Fidelity, Less Flexibility\n01:24 - Selective Data Migration: Flexibility with Trade-Offs\n02:03 - Wrapping Up: Choosing the Right Migration Path for Your Needs\n\n👉 Watch the video to gain insights into Azure DevOps migration strategies.

        "description": "💡 Debunking Scrum Master Misconceptions: Why Competence is Key 🚀\n\nIn this video, I tackle the widespread misconceptions surrounding the role of a Scrum Master, especially the difference between organizational roles and the true accountabilities as defined by Scrum. \n\nMany Scrum Masters transition into the role from other positions like project managers or developers without a deep understanding of the core principles that underpin Scrum and Agile. This leads to common mistakes, such as focusing on mechanical practices like user stories or burndowns, which aren’t even required by Scrum. \n\nI emphasize the need for Scrum Masters to focus on the principles, philosophies, and theories that truly drive success rather than blindly copying practices they don’t understand. Equally important, Scrum Masters should balance their attention between the team, the product owner, and the organization—ensuring that they create overall organizational effectiveness, not just team improvements.\n\nWatch as I debunk common myths and explain why competence in the role of Scrum Master goes beyond the mechanical aspects of Scrum. Let’s move toward a deeper, more effective understanding of the Scrum Master’s true accountability. 🌱\n\nChapters\n\n0:00 - Introduction: Common Misconceptions about Scrum Master Accountabilities  \n0:44 - The Transition from Other Roles to Scrum Master: Common Pitfalls  \n1:19 - Why “That’s Not Scrum” is a Common Response to Misunderstandings \n1:50 - Mechanical Practices Like User Stories and Burndowns Aren’t Required \n3:13 - Why Scrum Masters Focus Too Much on Mechanisms  \n4:06 - Scrum Masters Need to Understand Core Principles, Not Just Copy Practices  \n4:45 - The Scrum Master's True Focus: Team, Product Owner, and Organization  \n5:43 - The Danger of Creating Suboptimal Team Improvements  \n6:15 - Common Dysfunctional Scrum Master Stances and Behaviors  \n8:01 - Why a Scrum Master Shouldn’t Be a Team’s Scribe or Administrator \n9:12 - The Shift from Scrum Master as a Role to Scrum Master as Accountability  \n10:35 - Misconceptions That Become Fact: Story Points and User Stories  \n10:57 - How to Approach Scrum: Research, Understand, and Adapt\n\nReady to move beyond the misconceptions and develop the deep competencies that make a great Scrum Master? 💪 Visit [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com) to learn how we can help you understand the core principles, philosophies, and theories that drive real success in Scrum.

        "description": "The True ROI of Hiring Competent Scrum Masters\n\nIn this video, we’re discussing the *return on investment (ROI)* you should expect from hiring competent Scrum Masters. A Scrum Master who lacks competence in the context of the team’s work, product ownership, and organizational structure results in teams that deliver less value, produce more defects, and struggle to innovate. You’re simply not going to see the ROI you expect without the right skill set in place.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn from Watching This Video\n  \nIn this video, I explain why hiring skilled Scrum Masters is essential for maximizing your team’s performance and delivering meaningful product outcomes. You’ll learn:  \n\n- How competent Scrum Masters directly impact a team’s ability to deliver value, innovate, and maintain engineering excellence.  \n- Why you need to measure **product-based metrics** to track the real impact Scrum Masters have on your team’s effectiveness and ROI.  \n- Specific metrics such as **innovation rate**, **usage index**, and **installed version index**, which help quantify how well your team is performing and delivering value to customers.  \n- How to calculate your **return on the dollar** for every investment in product development, and how these metrics reveal where your Scrum Master’s influence should show improvement.  \n\nKey Chapters \n- [00:00:00] – The Problem with Incompetent Scrum Masters: Why lacking skills in team context results in poor ROI.  \n- [00:01:37] – Delivering More Stuff: Why ROI is about delivering value and not just improving team happiness.  \n- [00:02:02] – Key Metrics to Measure: Innovation rate, usage index, and other product-based metrics to track Scrum Master effectiveness.  \n- [00:06:44] – Real-World Data: How companies can misjudge their effectiveness and the importance of actual data in assessing product success.  \n- **[00:07:44]** – Measuring Scrum Master Impact: Expect real change in your metrics when you hire competent Scrum Masters, or you’ve hired the wrong ones.\n\nIf you’re ready to measure the real impact of your Scrum Masters and improve your team’s ability to deliver valuable outcomes, visit https://www.nkdagility.com.

        "description": "The Importance of Competent Scrum Masters in Driving Team Success\n\nUn this video, we’re diving into why Scrum Master competence is critical for team and organizational success. Scrum Masters who lack a deep understanding of both agile practices and the daily work of their teams often fail to deliver meaningful improvements. If a Scrum Master doesn’t understand the environment they’re coaching in—whether it's engineering or another domain—how can they effectively help the team? In this video, I break down why knowing the theory isn’t enough; practical competence is key.\n\nBy watching this video, you’ll gain insights into how a competent Scrum Master can dramatically improve a team's ability to deliver high-quality products. You’ll learn:  \n\n- Why Scrum Masters need to understand not just agile principles, but also the specific work their team does, whether it’s in engineering, product design, or another domain.  \n- How Scrum Masters can add value by teaching the team new skills and techniques that enhance productivity and quality, beyond just improving communication and engagement.  \n- Why focusing solely on team-building exercises or theoretical knowledge without real-world skills leaves teams stuck in the status quo, unable to deliver meaningful product outcomes.  \n- The difference between superficial improvements, like better team interactions, and actual business results, such as delivering working products that solve real customer problems.  \n\nKey Chapters  \n- [00:00:00] – Why Scrum Master Competence Matters: Understanding the theory and the team’s daily work is essential for success.  \n- [00:01:18] – The Ted Lasso Myth: Why fictional portrayals of coaching don’t translate to real-world effectiveness.  \n- [00:02:22] – The Sports Analogy: How great coaches understand the specifics of their field and help their teams improve through real-world knowledge.  \n- [00:03:39] – The Business Perspective: Scrum Masters must focus on delivering products that solve business problems, not just fostering team bonding.  \n- [00:06:14] – Biggest Bang for Your Buck: Why teaching teams new skills and capabilities provides the highest value for improving delivery outcomes.  \n\n\nIf your organization is looking to break the status quo and enable Scrum Masters who drive real product outcomes, visit https://www.nkdagility.com.\n\nWe can help your teams build competence, deliver valuable products, and achieve business success through expert coaching and agile training.

The massive demand for Scrum Masters has led to a systemic lack of competence across organizations. Many people have entered this field without the necessary skills, often with just a two-day course under their belt. But being a Scrum Master is about much more than that. It requires deep understanding, experience, and continuous learning.\n\nI share my experiences training police officers in Ghana, working with software teams, and consulting around the world, explaining why so many Scrum Masters are falling short. Without a solid understanding of the context within which they’re working—whether it’s software engineering, product ownership, or organizational change—Scrum Masters can’t truly help their teams. \n\nAs the industry faces economic uncertainty, organizations are starting to realize that many Scrum Masters don’t have the competence they need. We are seeing a massive correction in the industry, as companies let go of underqualified Scrum Masters and look for more experienced professionals. Watch to learn more about how we got here and what’s needed to fix this competence crisis. 🚀\n\nChapters\n\n0:00 - Introduction: The Competence Crisis in Scrum Master Roles  \n0:50 - Demand for Scrum Masters Far Outstrips Supply\n1:49 - The Influx of Unqualified Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches  \n2:45 - Why a Two-Day Course Doesn’t Make You a Scrum Master  \n4:55 - Training Police Officers in Ghana: An Example of Context and Competence  \n6:00 - Understanding the Context of the Team You’re Coaching \n9:00 - Why Competence in Software Engineering is Crucial for Scrum Masters \n12:00 - The Role of the Scrum Master in Supporting Product Owners \n14:00 - Organizational Change: The Third Key Responsibility of Scrum Masters\n18:00 - The Skills and Experience Required for Effective Scrum Masters  \n20:35 - A Massive Deficit in Scrum Master Competence \n21:13 - Scrum Master Competence Data: A Sobering Look at the Numbers  \n22:38 - The Industry Correction and What it Means for Scrum Masters\n\nAre you ready to step up as a competent Scrum Master? 🌱 Visit [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com) to discover how you can develop the deep understanding, skills, and experience needed to truly help teams and organizations thrive.

It’s not just about hiring the right people, but also supporting the ones we already have, encouraging continuous learning, and fostering a culture of experimentation. Without investing in our teams’ capabilities, we won’t be able to create the kind of innovative products that lead to success.\n\nOne major realization I had years ago was that unhappy, unmotivated people don’t build great products—they build mediocre ones. If you want to achieve greatness, you need happy, engaged, and knowledgeable people. That means creating environments where they feel valued and are encouraged to grow. Just like self-care in your personal life involves eating well and exercising, self-care in the workplace means continuously improving your skills and competence. Let's make sure we focus on building competence and stop hiring without it. 💪\n\n(b) Chapters\n\n0:00 - The Importance of Competence in Organizations \n0:37 - Why Unhappy People Build Mediocre Products  \n1:01 - Creating Environments that Foster Happiness and Growth  \n1:30 - The Connection Between Self-Care and Competence\n1:51 - The Need to Prioritize Competence in Hiring and Development\n\nIs your organization focused on building the competence of your people?

        "description": "🔧 Where Agile Went Wrong: Addressing the Competence Crisis 🚨\n\nIn this video, I discuss how Agile started going off the rails right from the beginning due to certain assumptions made by the creators of the Agile Manifesto. While they were the right people at the right time, there was an assumption that everyone participating had a high level of competence and continuous learning capabilities. Unfortunately, our current systems of education and work don’t foster that level of commitment to learning and experimentation. I explain how demand for skilled Agile practitioners has far outpaced the supply, leading organizations to lower the bar and hire Scrum Masters and leaders who lack the necessary skills to truly support their teams. \n\nI dive into why we need to refocus on hiring people who prioritize lifelong learning and why the roles of Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and leaders require deep context and competence to drive Agile success. If we don’t address this, we’ll continue to see a disconnect between Agile theory and real-world results. This video is all about how we can course-correct and build a more capable Agile workforce. 💡\n\nb) Chapters\n\n0:00 - Introduction: Agile’s Early Mistakes \n0:28 - The Assumptions Made by Agile’s Founders  \n1:06 - The Importance of Continuous Learning and Validation  \n1:52 - Why Most People Aren’t Committed to Lifelong Learning \n2:31 - The Supply-Demand Imbalance for Agile Competence  \n3:29 - The Role of Agile Communities and Learning  \n4:45 - Agile Teams as Special Operations Teams  \n5:09 - The Competence Crisis in Agile Roles\n6:03 - Scrum Masters: The Proxy for Team Competence  \n7:30 - The Incompetence of Many Scrum Masters  \n9:05 - Why Hiring Practices Must Change to Fix Agile  \n10:35 - Promoting Competent Leaders from Within the Organization  \n12:02 - The Importance of Context in Agile Leadership  \n13:22 - Why HR Should Demand Higher Standards for Scrum Masters  \n14:54 - Satya Nadella: A Case Study in Agile Leadership Competence\n\nIs your organization struggling with a shortage of truly competent Agile leaders?

        "title": "The Four Key Value Areas of EBM",
        "description": "📊 The Four Key Value Areas of Evidence-Based Management\n\n🎯 Introduction: Evidence-Based Management Overview\n\nWhen I talk about evidence-based management (EBM), I often refer to the four key value areas that encompass a holistic view of organizational success. These metrics ensure we don’t just optimize one area at the expense of the overall system. Each value area allows us to assess various aspects of the business and product, ensuring a balanced approach to growth and innovation.\n\n---\n\n🚀 The Four Key Value Areas\n\n 1. Market Value\n\nMarket value consists of two key areas: current value and unrealized value.\n\nCurrent Value:\n- What it measures: The value your existing product provides to users right now.\n- Key Metrics:\n  - Telemetry: Measure how often features are used, which customers use them, and how satisfied they are with the product.\n  - Customer Satisfaction: Through surveys and real-time data, understand customer feedback and overall happiness with the product.\n  - Revenue: Revenue generated from the product is another critical measure of its current value.\n\n Unrealized Value:\n- What it measures: The potential value that the product could create but hasn't tapped into yet.\n- Key Metrics:\n  - Product Backlog: What new features could be added, and what gaps exist that could unlock new markets or opportunities?\n  - Market and Competitor Analysis: Stay ahead by assessing trends, analyzing competitors, and looking for ways to expand market share.\n\n 📺 Analogy: TV Shows and New Markets\nJust like how TV networks invest in new series rather than additional seasons of existing shows, adding new features can bring in new audiences. A fresh, innovative feature can open up new markets and unlock greater potential than continuing with older, more familiar elements.\n\n---\n\n2. Organizational Capability\n\nThe second broad category is organizational capability, broken into two areas: ability to innovate and time to market.\n\nAbility to Innovate:\n- What it measures: How much focus and time your team spends on creating net new functionality vs. maintaining existing systems.\n- Key Metrics:\n  - Technical Debt: Any technical debt will reduce your team's ability to innovate. Managing this debt is critical to long-term success.\n  - Code Branch Management: How much time do you spend managing code between different environments or branches? Reducing this time can boost innovation.\n  - Production Incident Count: Track the number of production issues—more incidents could indicate lower quality in delivered innovation.\n\nTime to Market:\n- What it measures: The speed at which your team can move a change from idea to production.\n- Key Metrics:\n  - Cycle Time: How long it takes to deliver a new feature from the initial concept to the hands of the customer.\n  - Lead Time: How quickly can you change direction based on new information?\n  - Release Frequency: The frequency with which you release updates or new features to customers.\n\nExamples:\n- Facebook: They can go from code commit to production in 12.5 minutes!\n- Microsoft Windows: Shifting to regular updates and faster time-to-market helped improve quality and customer satisfaction.\n\n💡 Why Time to Market and Ability to Innovate Matter\n\nA fast time to market ensures your organization can adapt to customer needs more quickly, close the feedback loop, and increase customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, a high ability to innovate ensures that your teams aren't bogged down by technical debt and can continuously deliver new value. Together, these two metrics help maximize organizational capability and ensure you stay competitive in your industry.\n\n📊 Evidence-Based Management in Practice\n\n- Current Value: Know how your current product is performing by leveraging telemetry, revenue, and customer satisfaction metrics.\n- Unrealized Value: Look for opportunities that haven't been explored yet, either through backlog features or new market trends.\n- Ability to Innovate: Manage technical debt, reduce complexity, and increase the time your team can spend on creating new, valuable features.\n- Time to Market: Measure the speed of delivering changes to production, from cycle time to release frequency.\n\n🎯 Conclusion: The Power of the Four Key Value Areas\n\nBy focusing on the four key value areas, you can make informed decisions about your product’s development, align efforts across the business, and optimize both market value and organizational capability. It’s about ensuring that every area of your product delivery and management is measured, tracked, and continuously improved to maximize value and impact. \n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to discover how we can help you achieve great results",

        "description": "Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management (EBM)\n\n📘 Introduction to the Differences Between Traditional and Evidence-Based Management\n\n- Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management:\n  - Many people ask about the distinction between traditional management and evidence-based management (EBM). Interestingly, evidence-based practices have existed for decades, and some managers were applying these techniques long before it became a formal approach. The key difference lies in how decisions are made: traditional management often relies on intuition or hierarchy, while EBM focuses on data-driven decisions.\n\n🔍 Key Concepts in Traditional Management vs. EBM\n\n1. 📊 Data-Driven Decisions in EBM:\n   - EBM requires the collection and interpretation of data to inform decision-making. Managers must assess the data to understand the potential impacts and outcomes.\n   - Traditional management often relies on two approaches:\n     - Intuitive decision-making: \"I'm the manager, I’ll make the call.\"\n     - Escalation-based decision-making: \"Let me ask someone more senior to make the decision.\"\n  \n2. 🤔 Measuring for Success:\n   - In traditional management, decisions may be made without considering the evidence or clear outcomes. Evidence-based management, on the other hand, asks critical questions:\n     - \"Why are we doing this?\"\n     - \"What do we hope the outcome will be?\"\n     - \"How will we measure success?\"\n\n🚀 The Challenge of Evidence-Based Management\n\n1. 📈 Vanity Metrics in Traditional Management:\n   - Traditional managers often use vanity metrics, focusing on numbers that make them look good rather than metrics that help the organization succeed. These metrics don’t provide an accurate picture of what’s happening at a larger scale, creating a suboptimal decision-making process.\n   \n   - Example: Story points and velocity are often used to measure productivity. While they can be helpful within a team, they don’t provide useful data for decisions at the organizational level.\n\n2. 💡 Holistic Approach in EBM:\n   - EBM looks at the whole system rather than just one part. The focus is on whether the decisions made will help the entire organization achieve its goals, rather than just making an individual manager look good.\n\n⚖️ Making Better Decisions with EBM\n\n1. 🧠 Collecting Evidence:\n   - In EBM, decisions are based on collecting and validating evidence. The key is to figure out whether the evidence is good or bad and then make informed decisions.\n\n2. 🚫 Moving Beyond Vanity Metrics:\n   - Metrics like velocity or story points might make teams or managers feel productive, but they don’t provide the full picture of what’s truly driving success. EBM encourages focusing on outcomes and progress toward organizational goals, rather than surface-level metrics.\n\n🌟 Conclusion: Why EBM is Superior to Traditional Management\n\n- EBM Encourages Better Decision-Making:\n  - Evidence-based management allows organizations to make decisions that are informed by data, which is critical for driving real outcomes and success.\n  \n- Moving Away from \"Making It Up\":\n  - Rather than relying on gut feelings or hierarchy to make decisions, EBM focuses on gathering and validating evidence to optimize success at every level of the organization.\n\n- Focus on the Bigger Picture:\n  - While traditional management may focus on metrics that benefit individuals, EBM looks at the whole system, ensuring decisions are made to benefit the entire organization and align with its goals.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to discover how we can help you lead with Evidence-based Management in your #productdevelopment and #agileprojectmanagement",

        "description": "Understanding Evidence-Based Management (EBM)\n\n---\n\n📘 Introduction to Evidence-Based Management (EBM)\n\n- What is EBM?\n  - Evidence-based management (EBM) applies data-driven practices at both strategic and tactical levels in an organization.\n  - It focuses on using data to **inform** decisions, rather than control them, ensuring that actions positively impact outcomes.\n\n🧠 Key Concepts in EBM\n\n1. 📊 Data-Driven Decision Making*\n   - EBM is about collecting **evidence** within an organization to understand how actions and behaviors are affecting outcomes.\n   - It's essential to understand that **how people are measured** affects their behaviors. For instance, if someone’s behavior seems counterproductive, it could be driven by organizational metrics that encourage that behavior.\n\n2. 🔄 Focus on Positive Outcomes\n   - The goal of EBM is to foster behaviors that **positively impact outcomes**, such as increased customer value, revenue growth, or cost savings.\n   - Organizations must clearly define their desired outcomes, then measure progress towards those goals with appropriate metrics.\n\n---\n\nBest Practices in EBM\n\n1. 📊 Inform, Don’t Control\n   - Metrics should **inform** decisions, not dictate them. Data can provide insights but should not be treated as absolute truth without further investigation.\n   - Example: A team might have unresolved live site incidents for several sprints. This could be due to external dependencies beyond their control, not because of inefficiency.\n\n2. 🔍 Leading and Lagging Metrics:\n   - **Leading metrics** help predict future outcomes, while **lagging metrics** reflect past performance. A combination of both helps teams make more informed decisions about how to move forward.\n   \n3. 📈 Track Progress and Trends:\n   - Analyzing trends in data, such as the number of unresolved issues over time, can provide valuable insights. However, understanding the context behind the numbers is critical to avoid misinterpreting the data.\n\n⚖️ Making Informed Decisions\n\n1. 📉 Data Gaps and Extrapolation:\n   - It’s important to recognize that data will often have gaps, and informed decisions need to be made with the best available evidence.\n   - Teams need to gather **as much evidence as possible** and then make educated assumptions about areas with incomplete data.\n\n2. 🛠 Example of Using EBM:\n   - A company may set a metric around clearing live site incidents within three sprints. If a team hasn’t resolved an issue in six sprints, the data **informs** that there’s a delay, but it doesn’t mean the team is at fault. Further investigation might reveal that external factors are causing the delay.\n\n🌟 Conclusion: The Value of Evidence-Based Management\n\n- Informed, Not Controlled:\n   - EBM helps organizations make **evidence-informed decisions**, taking into account the complexity of real-world situations where data alone doesn’t provide the full story.\n   \n- Driving Positive Outcomes:\n   - By focusing on metrics that align with **desired outcomes**, such as customer value and operational efficiency, organizations can make better decisions that drive long-term success.\n\n- **EBM in a Nutshell**:\n   - EBM is about collecting evidence, understanding the broader context, and making informed decisions that positively impact organizational outcomes.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to explore how Evidence-based Management can be a game-changer for your organization.",

        "description": "### Panel Description: \"Should Companies Take Money Off the Table? Exploring Motivation Beyond Financial Incentives\"\r\n\r\nIn today's fast-paced business environment, the debate over the role of financial incentives in driving employee motivation is more relevant than ever. Join us for an engaging panel discussion where we dive deep into the idea of \"taking money off the table\" as a motivator and explore the principles outlined in Dan Pink's groundbreaking work, *Drive*.\r\n\r\nDan Pink argues that traditional reward systems based on financial incentives often fail to motivate people effectively, especially in complex, creative, or knowledge-based work. Instead, Pink suggests that true motivation comes from the intrinsic drivers of Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. But how practical is it for companies to shift away from financial rewards, and what are the potential impacts on employee performance, satisfaction, and retention?\r\n\r\nOur panel of experts will discuss:\r\n- **The Psychological Impact of Financial Incentives**: How do bonuses, raises, and other monetary rewards influence behavior? Are they as effective as we think?\r\n- **Dan Pink’s Framework**: A deeper look into Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose as the real drivers of motivation.\r\n- **Practical Applications**: How can companies realistically \"take money off the table\" and still maintain a motivated workforce?\r\n- **Case Studies**: Success stories and challenges faced by organizations that have shifted focus away from financial incentives.\r\n\r\nWhether you're a leader, HR professional, or just curious about the future of work, this panel will offer valuable insights into how companies can foster a more motivated and engaged workforce by looking beyond the paycheck.",

        "description": "🎯 Video Summary: Validating Feature Value in Product Development\n\n📘 Introduction: Understanding Feature Validation\n\n- Why Validate Features?\n  - When developing a product, it's crucial to ensure that the features you add provide real value to both the customers and the business.\n  - Without validation, you might end up with features that, while closing deals, ultimately fragment the product and fail to serve the users effectively.\n\n🔍 Key Concepts in Feature Validation\n\n1. 💡 Assumed Value vs. Actual Value:\n   - Sales-driven features often get added to products to close deals, but these features might not align with long-term user needs or product goals.\n   - The challenge lies in distinguishing between features that close a deal and those that truly add value over time.\n\n2. 💰 The Cost of Poor Validation:\n   - Adding a feature to close a $30,000 deal might seem beneficial, but if that feature costs $100,000 in support and maintenance over time and doesn't attract more customers, it’s a net loss.\n   - Sales teams may push for features that close deals because their incentives are tied to immediate revenue, not long-term value.\n\n3. 📈 Shifting to Value-Based Metrics:\n   - Organizations can benefit from changing how they measure success. For example, Microsoft shifted Azure salespeople's bonuses from the amount sold to the amount used by customers, aligning incentives with customer satisfaction and long-term value.\n\n🚀 Best Practices for Feature Validation\n\n1. 🔄 Hypothesis-Driven Engineering:\n   - Before adding a feature, create a hypothesis about the expected outcome. For instance, if you believe adding a Facebook login will increase user sign-ups, define the metrics that will prove or disprove this hypothesis.\n   - Collect data to measure the impact of the feature, such as the percentage of users who choose Facebook login and the overall increase in new users.\n\n2. 🧪 Experimentation and Telemetry:\n   - Implement telemetry to track feature usage and validate whether the feature is delivering the expected value.\n   - Use this data to make informed decisions about continuing, pivoting, or removing features.\n\n3. 📊 Push Back on Unvalidated Features:\n   - Encourage teams to challenge the addition of features by asking for a clear hypothesis and understanding the potential long-term costs.\n   - Validate features incrementally and be willing to halt further investment if early data shows the feature isn’t performing as expected.\n\n The Importance of Data in Decision Making\n\n- The Cost of Wasted Features:\n  - Data shows that only 35% of features in products are actually used by customers, meaning that a significant portion of development efforts may be wasted.\n  - This statistic highlights the importance of validating features before fully committing to them.\n\n- Making Informed Decisions:\n  - Product managers and teams need to use data to assess feature usage continuously.\n  - Decisions about whether to double down on, pivot, or remove features should be based on solid evidence, not assumptions.\n\n Conclusion: Emphasizing Validation in Product Development\n\n- Validation as a Core Practice:\n  - Validation is crucial to ensuring that the features you add to your product provide the intended value.\n  - By focusing on evidence-based decisions, you can reduce waste, enhance user satisfaction, and drive long-term product success.\n\n- Call to Action:\n  - Start integrating telemetry into your product, develop a culture of hypothesis-driven development, and push for validation at every step of the product lifecycle.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to explore how our #productevelopment mentorship program and Professional Product Discovery and Validation program can help you thrive. #agile #scrum #agile",

        "description": "What is Product Discovery and Why It’s Crucial?\n\n📘 Introduction: Understanding Product Discovery\n\n- What is Product Discovery?\n  - Product discovery is the critical work done to plan for the future of a product.\n  - It’s about more than just executing tasks; it’s about uncovering what needs to be built, understanding the market, and anticipating user needs.\n\n🔍 Key Concepts in Product Discovery\n\n1. 🔄 Continuous Exploration:\n   - Product discovery isn’t a one-time task; it’s an ongoing process of exploring and identifying both the known and unknown elements that could improve the product.\n   - It includes everything from research and design to collaboration with other teams to ensure a holistic understanding of what’s needed.\n\n2. 🧠 Expanding Beyond the Obvious:\n   - Discovery isn’t just about what you know you need; it’s also about uncovering needs and opportunities you didn’t realize were there.\n   - This proactive approach can lead to better user experiences, new market opportunities, and increased user base.\n\n3. 📊 Strategic Direction & Alignment:\n   - At scale, discovery involves setting strategic directions and aligning various teams and departments to work towards common goals.\n   - For example, large organizations like Microsoft engage in discovery to coordinate across numerous teams, ensuring everyone is moving towards the same objectives.\n\n4. 🔍 Refinement vs. Discovery:\n   - While Scrum calls part of this process \"refinement,\" discovery is broader, encompassing everything from the initial idea to the final product.\n   - It’s not just about fine-tuning; it’s about exploring new possibilities and ensuring that every decision aligns with the overall vision.\n\n🚀 Real-World Examples of Product Discovery\n\n1. Azure DevOps Example:\n   - With over 90 teams working on a single product, Azure DevOps illustrates the scale and complexity of product discovery.\n   - Strategic direction is set at a high level, and discovery is essential at every stage to ensure that all teams are aligned and contributing to the overall goal.\n\n2. Microsoft’s Creators Update:\n   - Microsoft’s focus on the \"Creators Update\" is an example of how discovery leads to tangible outcomes.\n   - By targeting creators (writers, artists, musicians), Microsoft enhanced its products to better serve this market, which involved coordinated efforts across multiple teams.\n\n🎯 The Importance of Product Discovery\n\n- Why It Matters:\n  - Without a strong discovery process, even the best engineering teams can fail to deliver real value.\n  - Discovery ensures that the team’s efforts are focused on the right problems, leading to better outcomes for the business.\n\n- Aligning Teams & Goals:\n  - Discovery aligns everyone from the lowest-level team members to the highest-level executives, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the organization’s strategic goals.\n\nConclusion: The Power of Deliberate Discovery\n\n- Product Discovery is Underserved:\n  - Despite its importance, many organizations don’t give enough attention to deliberate discovery.\n  - Shifting focus towards this can unlock new market opportunities and enhance the value delivered to customers.\n\n- The Future of Product Development:\n  - Teams that excel at discovery are not just executing; they’re innovating, creating, and driving the business forward.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com if you want help learning how to discover and validate products early in the #productdevelopment cycle.",

It's like finding your keys—you stop searching once you've found them. But what if there are better answers out there?\n- The Search for Better Solutions: The risk with self-taught knowledge is that we may miss out on better solutions simply because we stopped looking once we found something that works.\n\n---\n\n 🔍 The Value of Experience and Continuous Learning\n\n- Decades of Experience: With 20 years in software engineering and 10 years as a Scrum coach and consultant, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t across various organizations.\n- DevOps Evolution: Having been involved in DevOps since it was known as Application Lifecycle Management, I’ve witnessed its growth and transformation firsthand.\n  \n  🔄 Continuous Learning: Unlike the self-taught approach where learning stops after finding a solution, continuous learning involves constantly seeking out better methods, tools, and practices.\n\n---\n\n 💡 Diverse Knowledge Brings Better Solutions\n\n- Organizational Insights: Not every organization excels in every area. By working with a variety of companies, I've gathered a wealth of insights into what works well and what doesn’t.\n- The Power of Perspective: Bringing in different ideas from multiple sources can lead to discovering better solutions that you might not have considered on your own.\n  \n  💡 Ask More Questions: Have you thought about this? Exploring additional possibilities can lead to significant improvements.\n\n---\n\n 🎯 Key Takeaways\n\n- Beware the Knowledge Trap: Self-taught learning can limit your potential by stopping at the first solution you find. Always be curious and open to discovering more.\n- Leverage Experience: Decades of experience across different organizations provide a broader perspective on what works and what doesn’t.\n- Diverse Ideas: Don’t just rely on the first answer you find—there could be better solutions waiting to be uncovered.\n\n\n\n 🕒 Chapters\n\n1. **00:00 - 00:26 | The Limits of Self-Taught Learning**\n   - Why stopping at the first solution might not be the best approach.\n\n2. **00:26 - 00:36 | The Evolution of DevOps**\n   - From Application Lifecycle Management to modern DevOps.\n\n3. **00:36 - 00:46 | The Power of Diverse Knowledge**\n   - How insights from various organizations lead to better solutions.\n\n---\n\n 📊 Key Points\n\n- Continuous Learning: Don’t settle for the first solution—there might be better answers out there.\n- Experience Matters: Decades of experience can provide valuable insights into best practices.\n- Diversity of Thought: Embrace different ideas and perspectives to find the most effective solutions.\n\n\n 🔥 Don’t Forget to Subscribe!\n\nIf you found this video insightful, please like, share, and subscribe for more content on DevOps, continuous learning, and best practices in software engineering! 🚀\n\n---\n\nVisit https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/azure-devops-migration-services/ if you need help with DevOps or DevOps migration.",

        "description": "🎥 Video Summary: Tackling Technical Debt and Complex Product Architectures in DevOps Consulting\n\nIntroduction: Why Customers Seek DevOps Consulting\n\n- Customer's Dilemma: Companies usually approach DevOps consultants because they’ve identified a problem they can't solve on their own. It's rarely a random decision.\n- Real-World Example: One significant engagement involved a major oil and gas organization with a $50,000 per license desktop product. They knew they had a problem, but the real issue was more complex than they initially thought.\n\n 🚧 The Challenge: A Global Development Puzzle\n\n- Massive Scale: The product had been developed over 25 years, involving 90 teams across 13 locations in 9 different countries.\n- Acquisitions Complicate Matters: The company had acquired various competitors, integrating their technologies into one complex product architecture.\n\n  🔄 The Core Problem: The root issue wasn’t just the scale or complexity—it was the accumulation of technical debt.\n\n---\n\n 💡 Unveiling the Core Issue: Technical Debt\n\n- Neglected Integration: Instead of fully integrating acquired companies' systems into their own, the company left them as-is, leading to fragmented and inefficient processes.\n- Technical Debt Explained: By not addressing the accumulated technical debt—like continuing to use subversion systems instead of migrating to Git—the company created a convoluted architecture that was difficult and time-consuming to manage.\n\n---\n\n 🎯 Key Takeaways\n\n- Technical Debt: Ignoring or postponing the integration of systems and technologies can lead to long-term inefficiencies and complex challenges.\n- Proactive Integration: When merging different entities, it's crucial to integrate their systems fully to avoid future bottlenecks and technical debt.\n- Consulting Insight: A fresh perspective from a DevOps consulting service can help uncover deeper, systemic issues that might not be apparent at first glance.\n\n---\n\n Chapters\n\n1. **00:00 - 00:12 | The Customer's Dilemma**\n   - Why companies reach out to DevOps consultants.\n\n2. **00:12 - 00:44 | The Complexity of Scale**\n   - How a massive product architecture developed over 25 years became a tangled web.\n\n3. **00:00 - 00:29 | The Impact of Acquisitions**\n   - Integrating various technologies from acquired companies without proper alignment.\n\n4. **00:29 - 00:51 | The Root Cause: Technical Debt**\n   - The consequences of neglecting technical debt during system integration.\n\n5. **00:51 - 01:12 | The Lesson Learned**\n   - Why addressing technical debt is critical for maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n---\n\n Key Points\n\n- Understanding Technical Debt: It’s crucial to recognize and address technical debt early to prevent long-term complications.\n- Effective System Integration: Fully integrating acquired systems and technologies is essential to avoid future inefficiencies.\n- The Role of Consultants: Bringing in external experts can help identify and solve underlying issues that internal teams might overlook.\n\n---\n\n 🔗 Related Videos\n\n- [Understanding Technical Debt](#)\n- [Best Practices for System Integration](#)\n- [How to Scale DevOps in Large Organizations](#)\n\n---\n\n### **🔥 Don’t Forget to Subscribe!**\n\nIf this video provided valuable insights, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more content on DevOps, system integration, and technical debt management! 🚀\n\nVisit https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/azure-devops-migration-services/ if you're looking for expert DevOps migration services and consulting.",

        "description": "In this video, we delve into the complexities of implementing DevOps practices within organizations and how these practices can be tailored to meet the unique needs of different teams and companies. The speaker provides insights into how DevOps principles, while flexible, require careful consideration and adaptation to align with each organization's goals and challenges.\n\n Points Discussed:\n\n1. Customization of DevOps Services:\n   - The video begins by acknowledging that DevOps services are often customized for each client. While there are patterns in DevOps, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions because every organization has different goals, teams, and challenges.\n\n2. The Importance of Understanding the Current State:\n   - One common approach is conducting a \"state of DevOps\" report to understand where the organization currently stands. This is akin to using a map—you need to know your starting point to figure out the best direction to move forward.\n\n3. Assessment of Current Practices:\n   - The speaker discusses the importance of evaluating current practices, such as how products are being released and the tools being used. This assessment often reveals inefficiencies, like having multiple source control systems for a single product, which can be streamlined.\n\n4. Identifying Dysfunctional Behaviors:\n   - Through interviews and assessments, the video highlights how organizations often discover dysfunctional behaviors, or as the speaker prefers to call them, \"opportunities for improvement.\" These are common industry issues that arise when teams are pushed to solve problems without fully understanding the best practices.\n\n5. Overcoming Misconceptions:\n   - A significant part of the DevOps journey involves overcoming misconceptions, such as the belief that certain compliance requirements (like SOX) prohibit automated deployments. The video emphasizes the need to educate teams and leadership on how these compliance requirements can be met within a DevOps framework.\n\n6. The Value of DevOps:\n   - The video underscores the benefits of adopting DevOps practices, including higher quality, more frequent deliveries, and reduced friction in getting software to production. The concept of ownership is crucial—teams should own their ideas from development through deployment and beyond.\n\n7. Steps Toward Effective DevOps Implementation:\n   - Implementing DevOps involves ensuring compliance, maintaining quality, and controlling the risk of deployments. The speaker provides practical advice, such as avoiding deploying on Fridays and controlling the \"blast radius\" by testing deployments on a small scale before rolling them out widely.\n\n8. Case Study - Lessons from CrowdStrike\n   - The video concludes with a discussion of a recent high-profile incident involving CrowdStrike, where failure to control the blast radius during deployment led to massive disruption. This serves as a cautionary tale and highlights the importance of careful, staged deployments.\n\n### Chapters:\n\n1. **Introduction to Custom DevOps Services (00:00-00:37):**\n   - Overview of the need for bespoke DevOps solutions tailored to each organization's unique needs.\n\n2. **Understanding the Current State with DevOps Reports (00:37-01:30):**\n   - The importance of assessing the current state of DevOps practices within an organization.\n\n3. **Evaluating and Streamlining Current Practices (01:30-02:37):**\n   - Identifying inefficiencies and dysfunctional behaviors in current processes.\n\n4. **Overcoming Compliance Misconceptions (02:37-03:52):**\n   - Addressing and correcting common misconceptions about compliance and automated deployments.\n\n5. **Benefits of DevOps: Ownership and Quality (03:52-05:01):**\n   - Discussing the value DevOps brings in terms of ownership, quality, and reduced friction.\n\n6. **Practical Steps for Effective DevOps (05:01-07:18):**\n   - Practical advice for implementing DevOps practices, including managing risk and ensuring compliance.\n\n7. **Case Study - CrowdStrike Incident (07:18-09:42):**\n   - Analysis of the CrowdStrike deployment issue and the lessons learned about the importance of controlled deployments.\n\nThis video serves as a comprehensive guide for organizations looking to adopt or improve their DevOps practices, offering real-world examples and practical advice to navigate the complexities of modern software delivery.\n\nVisit https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/azure-devops-migration-services/ if you are looking for expert help and support with your migration.",

        "description": "In this video, discover how Kanban's pull-based principles can transform your workflow efficiency. Learn the core practices that make Kanban a game changer in project management, from defining and visualizing workflows to actively managing and improving them. Perfect for teams looking to enhance productivity and reduce waste. Join us to unlock the full potential of Kanban in your workplace!\n\n*Mastering Kanban: Creating a Pull-Based System for Enhanced Workflow*\n\nImplementing a Kanban strategy introduces a pull-based system of work, essential for streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency. This strategy revolves around three core practices: defining and visualizing your workflow, actively managing work items, and continuously improving the workflow. By embracing these practices, teams can significantly improve their process efficiency and output quality.\n\n*Defining and Visualizing Your Workflow*\n\nA foundational step in Kanban is to define and visualize your workflow. This involves setting up a system that clearly outlines the stages work passes through. However, simply defining columns on a board is just the beginning. For a system to truly embody Kanban, additional elements, such as work-in-progress (WIP) limits, must be incorporated. WIP limits are crucial as they prevent overloading any stage of the process, ensuring that work flows smoothly through the system.\n\n*Identifying Wait States*\n\nWait states, or stages where work pauses due to capacity constraints, are critical to understand and manage. These states can signal bottlenecks in the system, indicating areas where improvements are necessary. Visualizing these wait states helps teams recognize when and where to take action to alleviate congestion and maintain a steady flow of work.\n\n*Actively Managing Workflow*\n\nActive management involves constant evaluation of the workflow to identify areas of congestion or inefficiency. By adopting a pull-based system, teams ensure that work is only moved forward when capacity allows, thereby avoiding overburdening any part of the process. This system encourages teams to work within their means, pulling work into new stages only when they have the capacity to handle it effectively.\n\n*Continuous Improvement*\n\nThe goal of Kanban is not just to manage work but to continuously improve the process. This involves regularly reviewing the workflow, identifying inefficiencies, and making adjustments to enhance productivity and reduce wait times. Continuous improvement helps teams evolve their processes, adapt to changing demands, and maintain a high level of efficiency.\n\n*Applying Kanban Beyond Software Development*\n\nWhile Kanban originated in manufacturing, its principles are applicable across various industries, including software development, healthcare, and more. By creating a visual representation of work, setting clear WIP limits, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, any team can benefit from the increased clarity, focus, and efficiency that Kanban provides.\n\n*Need Help Implementing Kanban?*\n\nImplementing a Kanban strategy can be challenging, especially for teams new to the concept or those transitioning from other methodologies like Scrum. However, professional training, consulting, and coaching can provide the guidance needed to successfully adopt Kanban principles. Whether you're a Scrum team looking to integrate flow metrics or a new team building your workflow from the ground up, expert support can make all the difference. Visit https://www.nkdagility.com\n\nCan you explain how Kanban principles facilitate a pull based system of work?",

        "description": "Conquering Challenges in Kanban: The Perils of Ignoring Problems\nAcknowledging the Elephant in the Room\n\nIgnoring problems, or \"sweeping them under the rug,\" is a behavior that can significantly undermine the success of any process, but it's particularly detrimental in the context of a Kanban strategy. This common pitfall can prevent teams from achieving their full potential and delivering maximum value.\n\nThe Danger of Overlooking Issues\n\nHuman Tendency: It's a natural human inclination to overlook problems that seem daunting or unsolvable. This avoidance behavior can stem from a belief that the issue is too complex, or from a lack of confidence in our ability to tackle it.\nRetrospectives and Kaizen: Reflection sessions and continuous improvement practices are designed to bring hidden problems to light. Asking, \"Are we hiding or ignoring anything?\" is a crucial step in identifying and addressing underlying issues.\n\nA Personal Anecdote\n\nThe Unattended Grill: A relatable story shared involves neglecting the cleaning of a grill, leading to a fire incident. This narrative serves as a metaphor for what happens when problems are ignored in a work environment—eventually, the issues catch fire, causing significant disruptions.\n\nImplications for Teams and Projects\n\nBuildup of 'Cruft': Unaddressed issues can accumulate over time, manifesting as bureaucratic hurdles, technical debt, or inefficient processes. This buildup makes tasks increasingly difficult and can severely impact productivity and product quality.\nBursting Closets: The analogy of a closet stuffed with ignored items eventually bursting open illustrates the inevitable consequence of ignoring problems. Sooner or later, these issues will resurface, often at the most inopportune times.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nDiscipline and Courage: Overcoming the temptation to ignore problems requires discipline to confront issues head-on and the courage to tackle challenges, even when the solutions are not immediately evident.\nCollaborative Problem-Solving: A Kanban strategy thrives on team collaboration. Discussing and addressing problems collectively can lead to innovative solutions and stronger team cohesion.\n\nCall to Action\n\nImplementing a Kanban strategy effectively demands transparency, discipline, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.

        "description": "Crafting Success: The Power of Team Agreements in Kanban\n\nThe Foundation of Effective Collaboration\n\nThe cornerstone of any successful Kanban or agile strategy is not the methodology itself but the team's agreement on how to work together. Without a shared understanding and explicit agreement, teams can easily fall into disarray, with each member pulling in different directions based on individual preferences rather than a unified strategy.\n\nThe Pitfalls of Assumed Agreement\n\nLack of Direction: Without a clear, agreed-upon approach, team members may select tasks based on personal interest rather than strategic value, leading to a lack of cohesion and direction.\nMisconception of Frameworks: Merely adopting Scrum or any other framework without a detailed working agreement does not guarantee alignment. These frameworks provide structure, not solutions.\nThe Danger of Vanity Metrics: Relying on superficial metrics like story points or planning poker without a consensus on their use and value can lead to misguided efforts and ineffective measurement of progress.\nBuilding a Winning Strategy\nExplicit Working Agreements: Sit down as a team to decide on your approach, tools, and methods. This agreement forms the basis of your collaborative efforts and ensures everyone is aligned towards common goals.\nDefine Success: Clearly outline what success looks like for your team and how it aligns with the organization's objectives. This includes defining small wins that contribute to larger goals.\nCustomize Your Approach: Whether you're implementing Kanban, Scrum, or a hybrid strategy, the key is to adapt the methodology to fit your team's unique needs and agree on the best practices that will guide your work.\n\nCollaboration Over Dictation\n\nJoint Decision-Making: Imposing methods and tools top-down without team buy-in is a recipe for resistance and inefficiency. Collaboration and consensus-building lead to a more cohesive and motivated team.\nIterative Improvement: Your working agreement is not set in stone. Regularly review and adjust your strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances to continuously refine your workflow.\n\nCall to Action\n\nAligning on how to work together is not just a step towards improving your Kanban or agile practices; it's a leap towards building a more cohesive, efficient, and motivated team. If you're navigating the complexities of implementing a Kanban strategy or seeking to enhance your team's collaboration, we're here to offer guidance, support, and expert advice.

        "description": "Elevating Kanban Strategy: Beyond Vanity Metrics\n\nThe Pitfall of Ignoring Data\n\nImplementing a Kanban strategy without leveraging the power of data is a common misstep that can significantly hamper the effectiveness of the system. Simply having a board with columns and no work-in-progress (WIP) limits does not constitute a true Kanban strategy. The key to unlocking the full potential of Kanban lies in moving beyond surface-level metrics and diving deep into meaningful data analysis.\n\nDitching Vanity Metrics\n\nVanity Metrics: Metrics such as story points, velocity, and burn-down charts often do not provide the insights needed to optimize the flow of value to customers. These metrics can distract from the real issues and improvements needed within the workflow.\nThe Importance of Actionable Data: To truly improve your process, it's essential to focus on metrics that allow for actionable insights. Metrics that don't lead to meaningful change are merely distractions.\n\nFour Key Metrics for Kanban Success\n\nWork-in-Progress (WIP): Monitoring items that have started but not yet finished helps in understanding current workload and identifying bottlenecks.\nAge of Work: Determining how long work items have been in the system highlights potential delays and inefficiencies.\nDelivery Rate: By tracking the number of items delivered over a set period, teams can gauge their throughput and set realistic expectations.\nCycle Time: Knowing how long it takes to deliver work items from start to finish is crucial for predicting delivery times and improving process efficiency.\n\nLeveraging Data for Continuous Improvement\n\nData Collection: Utilizing digital tools like JIRA, Azure DevOps, or Trello can simplify the collection of start and end times for each piece of work, providing the foundational data needed for analysis.\nAnalysis and Adaptation: With the right data, teams can perform in-depth analyses to identify improvement opportunities. This cycle of transparency, inspection, and adaptation is key to evolving your Kanban system.\n\nCall to Action\n\nDon't let your Kanban strategy be undermined by a lack of focus on meaningful metrics.

        "description": "Maximizing Flow with Kanban: A Strategy for Success\n\nUnlock the Potential of Your Workflow\n\nIn the realm of Kanban, improving your workflow stands as a cornerstone practice. It's not just about setting up a system; it's about continually refining it to ensure peak efficiency and value delivery. Below, discover key insights and strategies from our latest video to enhance your workflow and drive success.\n\nVisualize, Manage, Improve\n\nVisualize Your Workflow: The first step is to have a clear visual representation of your entire process. This visibility is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.\nActively Manage Work: Actively managing your workflow means not just observing but taking action. Adjust work in progress, tackle blockages, and ensure work doesn't pile up or linger unfinished.\nImprove Continuously: The essence of Kanban. Once you've visualized and managed, the next step is to improve. Identifying problems is one thing; implementing changes to solve them is where the true benefit lies.\n\nCase Study: Transforming Approvals\n\nA compelling example shared in the video highlights the power of proactive workflow management. A team faced delays due to a weekly approval process, causing a backlog of work. By visualizing the cost of delays on their Kanban board, they not only made the problem visible to all, including decision-makers, but also motivated immediate change. The approver adjusted their behavior, checking for items needing approval twice daily, significantly reducing wait times and boosting the team's efficiency.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIdentify and Address Blockages: Understand the root cause of delays and blockages in your system and take decisive action to remove them.\nVisualize Impact: Use visual tools to highlight the cost or impact of inefficiencies in your workflow. This can prompt necessary changes and improve accountability.\nEmbrace Continuous Improvement: Always look for ways to refine and enhance your workflow. Small adjustments can lead to significant gains in efficiency and value delivery.\n\nCall to Action\n\nAre you ready to take your team's workflow to the next level? Whether you're new to Kanban or looking to refine your existing system, our video provides essential strategies and insights for success.

Part 5.\n\nAccelerating Value Delivery: Mastering Time-to-Market with Evidence-Based Management\n\nIn today's fast-paced business world, the speed at which an organization delivers value is a critical determinant of its success. Understanding and optimizing this timeframe is vital. This is where Evidence-Based Management (EBM) becomes an indispensable tool, particularly in its key value area: Time to Market.\n\nThe Importance of Time-to-Market\n\nTime to Market (TTM) is not just a metric; it's a comprehensive reflection of your organization's efficiency and agility. It provides insights into how quickly your organization can respond to market changes and customer needs.\n\nKey Metrics to Enhance Time-to-Market\n\nLead Time: The duration from the conception of a product or project to its delivery.\nCycle Time: The time taken to complete one cycle of a process.\nTime to Pivot: Measures how quickly an organization can change direction in response to market demands.\nTime to Learn: The speed at which your organization can acquire and apply new knowledge.\nTime to Fix: The time it takes to identify and resolve issues.\nBy tracking these metrics, you gain a clear understanding of your organization's delivery capabilities.\n\nUtilizing EBM to Improve Delivery Speed\n\nTo effectively use EBM for enhancing your Time to Market, consider the following approach:\n\nStrategies for Reducing Time-to-Market\n\nImplement Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track and review the above metrics to get real-time insights into your processes.\nIdentify Bottlenecks: Use these metrics to pinpoint where delays are occurring and why.\nAdopt Agile Methodologies: Agile practices can significantly reduce cycle times and lead times by promoting flexibility and rapid iteration.\nFoster a Learning Culture: Encourage quick learning and application of new knowledge to stay ahead of market trends.\nPractical Insights: From Metrics to Enhanced Value\nIn my professional journey, I have witnessed how effective management of Time to Market can transform organizations.\n\nReal-World Example: Streamlining Lead Times\n\nA software development company I worked with significantly reduced its lead time by adopting Agile methodologies. This shift not only accelerated their product delivery but also improved their responsiveness to customer feedback.\n\nImpact on Business Success\n\nEnhanced Customer Satisfaction: Faster delivery times mean quicker responses to customer needs and market changes.\nIncreased Competitive Edge: Reduced Time to Market can provide a significant advantage over competitors.\nImproved Operational Efficiency: Understanding and optimizing these metrics lead to more streamlined processes.\n\nConclusion: Embracing EBM for Faster Value Delivery\n\nIn conclusion, mastering Time to Market through Evidence-Based Management is essential for any organization looking to thrive in today's competitive landscape. By focusing on key metrics like lead time, cycle time, and time to pivot, organizations can not only understand but also significantly improve how quickly they deliver value to their customers.\n\nStart leveraging EBM to accelerate your Time to Market. It’s not just about speed; it’s about strategic agility and efficiency that drives your business forward.",

        "description": "#shorts #shortvideo #shortsvideo 5 reasons why you need #ebm in your #agile environment. Part 4.\n\nMaximizing Organizational Value Through Innovation: The Role of Evidence-Based Management\n\nIn today's dynamic business environment, understanding and enhancing your organization's effectiveness in improving value is crucial. This is particularly true for organizations involved in software development, where innovation is a key driver of success. Evidence-Based Management (EBM) offers a structured approach to assess and boost this capability.\n\nUnderstanding Organizational Capability and Innovation\n\nThe heart of enhancing organizational value lies in understanding your capability, particularly in innovation. EBM provides the framework to measure and improve this aspect.\n\nKey Metrics in Monitoring Innovation\n\nActive Branches in Software Development: This metric indicates the number of ongoing initiatives or updates in your software projects.\nTechnical Debt: Measures the cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.\nInnovation Rate: The percentage of time spent on innovation versus time consumed in dealing with complexities.\nThese metrics are not just numbers; they are indicators of your organization’s health and its potential for growth.\n\nEffective Use of EBM in Enhancing Value\n\nTo leverage EBM effectively in your organization, particularly in the realm of software development, consider the following steps:\n\nImplementing EBM for Innovation\n\nChoose Relevant Metrics: Select metrics that align with your organizational goals and the nature of your projects.\nRegular Monitoring: Establish a routine for tracking these metrics to get a continuous sense of your innovation efforts.\nData-Driven Decision Making: Use the insights gained from these metrics to make informed decisions about resource allocation, project prioritization, and process improvements.\n\nPractical Insights: From Metrics to Action\n\nIn my experience working with software development teams, the application of these EBM metrics has been transformative.\n\nCase Study: Balancing Innovation and Technical Debt\n\nFor example, a tech company tracked its technical debt alongside its innovation rate. This dual focus allowed them to balance the urgency of current development needs with the long-term health of their software, leading to more sustainable growth.\n\nDriving Value Improvement\n\nPrioritizing Innovation: By understanding the innovation rate, organizations can adjust their strategies to allocate more time to groundbreaking work.\nManaging Technical Debt: Regular assessment of technical debt ensures that it doesn't hinder future development efforts.\nAdapting Strategies: Based on these metrics, organizations can pivot their approaches to overcome challenges and seize new opportunities.\n\nConclusion: Harnessing EBM for Organizational Excellence\n\nThe journey to improving organizational value is continuous, and the use of EBM provides a clear pathway to track and enhance innovation. By understanding and applying relevant metrics, organizations can not only gauge their current effectiveness but also strategically plan for enhanced value creation.\n\nEmbrace EBM as a tool for growth. Let it guide your strategies, refine your processes, and ultimately lead your organization to new heights of innovation and success.",

Part 3\n\nUnlocking Unrealized Value in Your Product: A Guide to Evidence-Based Management\n\nIn the competitive world of product development, understanding and tapping into the full potential of your product is vital. This is where Evidence-Based Management (EBM) becomes an indispensable tool. It helps identify and capitalize on unrealized value, ensuring your product reaches its maximum potential.\n\nExploring the Concept of Unrealized Value\n\nUnrealized value represents the potential benefits and growth your product could achieve but hasn't yet. It's about finding the gaps between what your product is and what it could be.\n\nIdentifying Potential with EBM\n\nEvidence-Based Management offers a structured approach to uncover these gaps. By focusing on the key value area of unrealized value, EBM guides you in setting metrics that reveal these hidden opportunities.\n\nImplementing EBM to Discover Unrealized Value\n\nThe process of uncovering unrealized value through EBM involves specific metrics and a deep understanding of your product and market.\n\nKey Metrics to Consider\n\nExperience or Satisfaction Gap: Measures the difference between the current user experience and the ideal or expected experience.\nMarket Share: Assesses your product's position in the market compared to competitors.\nCustom Metrics: Tailored metrics that align with your specific product and target audience.\nThese metrics serve as indicators of where your product stands and where it could potentially reach.\n\nReal-World Application: From Metrics to Product Backlog\n\nIn my professional experience, utilizing EBM to explore unrealized value has led to significant product improvements and market positioning.\n\nCase Study: Leveraging User Satisfaction Gaps\n\nFor instance, a tech company identified a significant user satisfaction gap through customer feedback. This insight led to targeted enhancements in their product's user interface, resulting in increased user engagement and market share.\n\nThe Role of Product Backlog\n\nUnderstanding unrealized value is not just about identifying gaps; it's about acting on them. This is where the product backlog comes into play. It becomes a strategic tool to prioritize and address these identified areas of potential growth.\n\nConclusion: Harnessing Unrealized Value for Competitive Advantage\n\nEvidence-Based Management is more than a methodology; it's a catalyst for growth. By focusing on unrealized value, you not only gain insights into what your product is lacking but also chart a clear path for its development and improvement.\n\nEmbrace EBM to uncover the untapped potential of your product. Use it to refine your product backlog and drive strategic enhancements. This proactive approach ensures your product doesn't just meet current demands but is also poised for future success and innovation.",

Part 2.\n\nDecoding Organizational Value with Evidence-Based Management\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of modern business, understanding and maximizing the value delivered by your organization is crucial. This is where the concept of evidence-based management (EBM) steps in, offering a strategic framework to assess and enhance your organizational value.\n\nThe Essence of Evidence-Based Management\n\nEBM is more than a methodology; it's a tool that empowers organizations to gauge their current value effectively. It revolves around using specific metrics and data to gain insights into various aspects of business performance.\n\nKey Metrics to Consider\n\nCustomer Satisfaction: A direct reflection of how well your products or services meet customer needs.\nEmployee Satisfaction: An indicator of workforce morale, which impacts productivity and retention.\nRevenue Per Employee: Measures the efficiency and productivity of your workforce.\nProduct Cost Ratio: Provides insights into the profitability of your products.\nTelemetry and Customer Usage Index: Helps understand the actual usage and engagement with your products.\nBy leveraging these metrics, you can paint a comprehensive picture of your organization's performance.\n\nMaking Better Decisions with EBM\n\nEvidence-based management isn't just about collecting data; it's about using that data to make informed decisions.\n\nSteps to Leverage EBM Effectively\n\nIdentify Relevant Metrics: Focus on metrics that align with your organizational goals and values.\nRegular Data Collection: Establish a consistent process for gathering and updating your data.\nAnalytical Approach: Analyze the data to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities.\nActionable Insights: Use these insights to inform strategic decisions and drive organizational improvement.\n\nHarnessing the Power of EBM: A Real-World Example\n\nIn my experience, implementing EBM can significantly transform how decisions are made. For instance, a company I worked with used customer satisfaction scores to revamp its product features. This shift, informed by direct customer feedback, led to an increase in user engagement and, subsequently, revenue.\n\nImpactful Changes Through EBM\n\nImproved Product Design: Based on customer usage data, products can be tailored to better meet user needs.\nEnhanced Employee Engagement: Employee satisfaction metrics can lead to a more motivated and efficient workforce.\nFinancial Optimization: By analyzing revenue per employee and product cost ratios, financial resources can be allocated more effectively.\n\nConclusion: Why EBM is Essential for Your Organization\n\nEvidence-based management is not just a tool; it's a mindset that encourages data-driven decision-making. In a world where business dynamics are constantly changing, EBM provides a solid foundation for understanding and improving the value your organization delivers.\n\nBy embracing EBM, you're not only equipping your organization with the means to assess its current state but also paving the way for informed, strategic decisions that drive future success. Start integrating evidence-based management today, and witness a tangible transformation in how your organization operates and thrives.",

Part 1.\n\nEmbracing Evidence-Based Management in Agile Environments: A Key to Success\n\nIn today's fast-paced business landscape, the adoption of Agile and Scrum methodologies has become pivotal for companies aiming to thrive and stay ahead of the competition. However, it's not just about implementing Agile practices; it's about ensuring that these practices genuinely contribute to your organization's success. This is where the concept of evidence-based management becomes crucial.\n\nUnderstanding Evidence-Based Management\n\nEvidence-based management is a strategic approach that focuses on gathering data and using it to make informed decisions. This method is particularly significant in Agile environments, where changes are constant, and the need to adapt is continuous.\n\nThe Impact on Success\n\nMeasuring Change: By integrating evidence-based management, you can clearly understand and measure the impact of alterations made to your system.\nValue Delivery: This approach ensures that your efforts are aligned with delivering value to the business in the most efficient way possible.\nSuccess Evaluation: It allows you to determine whether the changes made are moving the needle in the right direction.\n\nThe Need for Measurement in Agile\n\nAgile and Scrum are dynamic, with continuous iterations and improvements. To keep up with these changes and ensure they are beneficial, measurement is key.\n\nHow to Measure Effectively\n\nSet Clear Metrics: Define what success looks like in your context and set measurable goals.\nUse Agile Tools: Utilize tools designed for Agile environments to track progress and performance.\nRegular Reviews: Conduct frequent reviews to assess whether the changes align with your objectives.\n\nMy Personal Experience with Evidence-Based Management\n\nIn my journey of integrating evidence-based management into Agile environments, I've seen firsthand how it transforms operations.\n\nReal-World Examples\n\nEnhanced Decision-Making: In one instance, a team struggling with delivery timelines implemented specific metrics for tracking progress. This data-driven approach enabled them to pinpoint bottlenecks and streamline their process.\n\nIncreased Value Delivery: Another team focused on measuring customer satisfaction. By adjusting their strategies based on customer feedback data, they significantly increased value delivery.\n\nActionable Recommendations\n\nTo truly benefit from evidence-based management in your Agile environment, consider these actionable steps:\n\nImplement a Systematic Approach: Incorporate a structured system for collecting and analyzing data.\nFocus on Relevant Metrics: Choose metrics that directly impact your business goals and objectives.\nFoster a Data-Driven Culture: Encourage your team to make decisions based on data and evidence.\nRegularly Review and Adjust: Be open to changing your approach based on what the data tells you.\n\nIntegrating evidence-based management into your Agile and Scrum practices is not just a recommendation; it's a necessity for thriving in today's business world. By measuring the impact of your changes and aligning them with your organizational goals, you can ensure that your Agile journey is not only about speed and flexibility but also about delivering real, measurable value.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to implement changes but to make changes that propel your business forward. Embrace evidence-based management, and witness the transformation in your Agile environment.",

        "description": "The #agilemanifesto was a strong signal from the #softwarengineer community that traditional #projectmanagement wasn't well suited to complex environments, and a new style of working and thinking was needed to thrive in these environments.\n\nAs such, #agile gained a lot of traction in the market and more organizations adopted #scrum or an #agileframework to help them navigate uncertainty and complexity. For many, that just meant that today we did this and tomorrow we're doing #scrum without any formal training, coaching, or professional guidance.\n\nAs such, many teams haven't mastered the basics and @ScrumOrg have created a new Professional Scrum Product Backlog Management course to help people master this element of scrum. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why Product Backlog Management is receiving a great deal of attention right now.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

        "description": "War is one of the seven signs of the Agile-pocolypse! ⚔️\n\nAs an Agile expert, I'm passionate about helping teams to succeed. And that includes helping them to resolve conflict and create a positive and productive work environment.\n\nFull Video: https://youtu.be/wHGw1vmudNA\n\nIn this video, I'm going to give you some tips on how to de-escalate team conflict and prevent it from turning into a full-blown war.\nBut first, let's talk about why conflict happens in the first place.\n\nAgile teams are made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. That's a good thing! It's what makes Agile teams so innovative and successful. But it can also lead to conflict, especially when people have different ideas about how to get things done.\n\nSo, conflict is normal. It's how we learn and grow. But if it's not managed effectively, it can damage team morale and productivity.\nSo, what can you do to de-escalate team conflict?\n\nHere are a few tips:\n• Talk to the team members involved and try to understand the root of the conflict. What are their underlying concerns? What are they trying to achieve?\n• Encourage team members to communicate with each other respectfully and openly. This means listening to each other's perspectives, even if you disagree with them.\n• Help team members to find common ground and compromise. This may involve brainstorming solutions together or finding a middle ground that everyone can accept.\n• Mediate between team members if necessary. This can be helpful if team members are unable to resolve the conflict on their own.\n• If the conflict is severe, it may be necessary to bring in a professional mediator or coach.\n\nIt's important to remember that conflict is not the end of the world. In fact, it can be a valuable opportunity for team members to learn from each other and grow. By taking action to de-escalate conflict and promote a culture of cooperation, you can help your team to succeed.\nNow, go out there and create some Agile peace and prosperity! ✌️\n\nAbout Naked Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

        "description": "*Understanding Barriers in Product Ownership*\nDevelopers often face challenges in accepting a product owner as the final decision maker. This video dives deep into the reasons behind this. *Enjoy this video? Like and subscribe to our channel:* https://www.youtube.com/@nakedAgility\n\nIn this video, Martin 🎙️ discusses the barriers that prevent developers from fully accepting a product owner's decisions. He highlights the importance of respect and accountability within the organization. When a product owner is undermined, it affects the team's trust and the overall effectiveness of the product management process. Martin emphasizes that everyone in the organization, from top to bottom, needs to respect the product owner's role and decisions. If there's a lack of alignment or undermining, it's essential to address the root cause rather than bypassing the product owner's authority. 🚀\n\n*NKDAgility can help!*\nThese are the kinds of issues that lean-agile practitioners love and most folks hate, and if you find it hard to establish trust and respect for product owners in your organization, my team at NKDAgility can help you or help you find a consultant, coach, or trainer who can.\n\nIf you have issues that are undermining the effectiveness of your value delivery, it's especially important to find help as soon as you can and not wait!\n\n_You can request a free consultation:_ https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/\n_Sign up for one of our upcoming professional Scrum classes:_ https://nkdagility.com/training-courses_\n\nBecause you don't just need agility, you need Naked Agility.\n\n#scrum, #agile, #productowner, #agileprojectmanagement, #projectmanagement, #agilecoach, #agiletraining, #scrumorg",

This video dives deep into the reasons behind this. *Enjoy this video?

He highlights the importance of respect and accountability within the organization. When a product owner is undermined, it affects the team's trust and the overall effectiveness of the product management process. Martin emphasizes that everyone in the organization, from top to bottom, needs to respect the product owner's role and decisions. If there's a lack of alignment or undermining, it's essential to address the root cause rather than bypassing the product owner's authority. 🚀\n\n*NKDAgility can help!*\nThese are the kinds of issues that lean-agile practitioners love and most folks hate, and if you find it hard to establish trust and respect for product owners in your organization, my team at NKDAgility can help you or help you find a consultant, coach, or trainer who can.\n\nIf you have issues that are undermining the effectiveness of your value delivery, it's especially important to find help as soon as you can and not wait!\n\n_You can request a free consultation:_ https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/\n_Sign up for one of our upcoming professional Scrum classes:_ https://nkdagility.com/training-courses_\n\nBecause you don't just need agility, you need Naked Agility.\n\n#scrum, #agile, #productowner, #agileprojectmanagement, #projectmanagement, #agilecoach, #agiletraining, #scrumorg",

These individuals face the challenge of making quick decisions to seize fleeting opportunities. 🚀🎯\n\nDrawing parallels with the entrepreneurial mindset, Martin discusses the inherent risks and rewards of decision-making. He touches upon the famous (albeit possibly misattributed) Edison quote about finding numerous ways not to make a light bulb before achieving success. 💡🔍 The video also emphasizes the importance of building trust within teams, ensuring that even if not everyone agrees with a decision, they support it.

A multi-week learning journey where you don't just learn valuable information, but also get to apply it on the job in the form of assignments and tasks. You also get to bring what you have learned back into the classroom and receive coaching that will help you iterate and improve.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of the new immersive learning experience and how it will help you in your job.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

You need to invest a great deal of time and effort in learning, practicing, and receiving coaching if you are going to be great at what you do.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of certification in your journey to mastery, and how following Scrum.Org certification paths can help ensure that you are studying the right materials, listening to industry respected thought leaders, and receiving validation of your knowledge and capabilities through an official certification body.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

Dive into this insider’s journey, uncover hidden truths, and find out why Scrum.org is favoured by professionals seeking effective and lasting certification.

Scrum.Org and #scrumalliance.\n\nThe majority of people who become a #scrummaster, #productowner, or #agileleader pass through one of these two certification paths, and go on to build a career in #agile based on what they have learned in the training room.\n\nSo, what is the difference between these two bodies? Why would you choose one over the other when presented with a choice?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why he chose the scrum.org path as both a student and a #professionalscrumtrainer.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg \n\nWhy did you choose the Scrum Org track rather than the Scrum Alliance track?",

        "description": "The #agile industry has a bit of a problem when it comes to regulation, skills development, and validation of an #agilecoach or #agileconsultant. In some cases, a #scrummaster with 2 years' experience can simply amend their CV and call themselves an #agilecoach or #agileconsultant without having the necessary skills, expertise, or experience to do the job.\n\nThere are great certification paths for an #agilecoach, and there are great #agileconsultants out there, it can just be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff if you've never worked with an experienced #agileconsultant.\n\nSo, how do you know if your person is the right person for the job? How do you know if your #agileconsultant is making rookie mistakes or whether they are the perfect catalyst to help you successfully adopt and master #agile?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood highlights a common mistake made by rookie agile consultants and provides some insights into what they should be doing instead.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

You know what needs to be done, you know who is best positioned to do the work, and you know how long that will take and how much it will cost to do.\n\nBecause it is complicated, it tends to be linear and stable, and so it's simply a matter of running a tight ship from point A to Z to ensure you get the job done efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn complex environments, things become way tougher. You have never built the solution or solved the problem before, and so you don't know what you don't know.\n\n#agile is a process of developing a hypothesis, running an experiment, inspecting what has been created, and using the data and evidence to inform what you should do next.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how #scrum provides a framework to help #leadership teams decide which work is the most valuable, in the context of the customers they serve, and within the organizations constraints.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

        "description": "Jeff Sutherland, the co-creator of #scrum, titled his book 'How to do twice the work in half the time' and it's been a value proposition for the #scrumframework ever since.\n\nIf you're a traditional organization using #projectmanagement, it can be a very attractive proposition because your focus lies in delivery - execution of a predetermined plan - and it's natural to assume that #scrum will enable your team to simply do more with less.\n\nMany #agile purists and #scrum practitioners will tell you that the goal of #scrum is to be more effective, rather than efficient, and so productivity isn't really the goal of #agile. So, how do we reconcile the value proposition of a co-creator of #scrum with what it actually empowers you to do?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood speaks about the value proposition of #scrum and whether it does actually allow you to do twice the work in half the time.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

We know how to build a road, we know who is best positioned to build the road, we know how long it takes to build the road, and we have a great idea of how much it costs to build that road.\n\nWhen you step into a complex environment, everything changes because the problem you are trying to solve has never been solved before. The solution you are trying to create has never been created before. So, you don't know what you don't know, and there are way too many variables to guess upfront, so you need to approach things differently.\n\nThis is where things get tricky because it doesn't help to simply throw your hands up and tell #leadership and #executive teams that you don't know, and cannot know, until you have actually solved the problem or built the solution.\n\nThere has to be a bridge. A way of moving effectively from the initial starting point, through each iteration and evolution, until you have created the most valuable product or solved the most compelling problem.\n\n#agile is a great approach to this kind of #productdevelopment and has proven itself time and again over the past 25 years. So, if your organization hire an #agileconsultant to achieve increased #businessagility and critical business objectives, how will you know that the engagement is creating value?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood provides some examples of valuable outcomes that could emerge from an #agileconsulting engagement.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/\n \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

Instead, they act as a servant leader that teaches, coaches, and mentors the team to success.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what you will learn on the professional #scrummaster course (#psm) and how that will help you become a great scrum master.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

It isn't about the theory of #scrum, it's about living and breathing the experience of applying #scrum in a live environment.\n\nWhether you are a #scrummaster, #productowner, #developer, or aspiring #agileleader, this course is perfect for you. It is a simulation that captures how you currently work and solve complex problems, and then leads you through 4 sprints to teach you how to effectively apply #scrum in your own, unique context.\n\nSo, how does the APS course achieve that? Why is this such an effective #scrumtraining course in helping both individuals and teams leverage the power of #scrum?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the #APS course and how it helps people apply #scrum effectively.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/\n \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",

        "description": "In simple or complicated environments, such as civil engineering and building bridges, traditional #projectmanagement has done a great job because we know how to build bridges, we know how much they cost, we know all the variables involved, and we know who is best positioned to build the bridge based on past performance.\n\nIn complex environments,. we don't know the answers upfront. We know that something is important but we may not know if the problem can be solved or whether it is possible to build the product. We certainly can't know all of the variables upfront and it's common for circumstances to change, requiring us to pivot rapidly and respond to customer needs or competitor activity.\n\nThe #agile industry talk about the need to shift from #project to #product, and have great case studies that demonstrate how effective #agile is at #productdevelopment in complex environments.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood describes the difference between #projectmanagement and #productdevelopment in the context of #agile environments.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nIf you’re thinking of adopting #agile for your #productdevelopment and #projectmanagement needs, consider #SAFe aka #scaledagileframework.

Students will complete the course ready to take the globally recognised certification exam included in the course fee.\n\nAs part of our learning experience for every participant, we provide a 30-minute learning review, a 60-minute coaching session, and access to future courses at a 30% discount on future classes.\n\nWe recognise the positive impact that a happy AND motivated workforce that has purpose has on client experience. We help change mindsets towards a people-first culture where everyone encourages others to learn and grow. The resulting divergent thinking leads to many ideas and opportunities for the organisation's success.\n\nAll participants gain complimentary access to the premium \"Professional Scrum\" space in our public community \"The League of Extraordinary Lean-Agile Practitioners\". \n\nI hope to see you there; click the link below to find out more…",

        "description": "The Professional Scrum Product Owner is a hands-on, activity-based course where students explore Professional Scrum and develop an understanding of the Product Owner’s critical role on the Scrum Team. Being a professional Product Owner encompasses more than writing requirements or managing a Product Backlog. Product Owners need to have a concrete understanding of all product management aspects, including but not limited to product ownership, that drives value from their products.\n\nBeing a Product Owner is a key position that sets the tone for product leadership and the definition of success in the organization. As a Product Owner, modern product management practices and mindsets are expected to be put into practice daily. The Product Owner is accountable for and has the authority to maximize the value of the product and the effectiveness of the Product Backlog.\n\nOur training is delivered as an interactive, activity-based course over half-day sessions using Microsoft Teams, and Mural. Throughout the class, students learn several Product Ownership practices that they can use once they leave the classroom while also receiving an introduction to Agile Product Management. Between sessions, we provide additional reading, writing, and watching activities to maximise the learning opportunities and complement the classroom experience.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the class, we provide access to a community of peers and continued access to the trainer through office hours, quarterly catchups, and constant engagement. All students are given a password to take the PSPO1 assessment to maximise validated learning. If they take it within 14 days and are unsuccessful, they will be granted a second attempt.\n\nAs part of our validated learning experience, we provide a 30-minute learning review, a one-hour coaching session, and access to future courses at a 30% discount on future classes.",

They need to expand, or scale, to a group of Scrum Teams working together on the same product. When doing so, they often encounter common challenges with cross-team dependencies, self-management, transparency and accountability.\n\nWhen introducing heavy-weight scaling methodologies, teams often find that the added overhead slows down the teams and distracts from the essence and benefits of Scrum. Instead, the Nexus Framework minimally extended the Scrum Framework to include ways that help solve the dependency and collaboration challenges of cross-team work. Since Nexus enhances the foundational elements of Scrum, it reinforces the benefits of Scrum while also being familiar to those that have used Scrum.\n\nThe Scaled Professional Scrum™ (SPS) with Nexus course, builds on the Nexus framework by introducing complementary practices and techniques proven to help teams scale. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS) certification exam.\n\nOur training is delivered as an interactive, activity-based course over half-day sessions using Microsoft Teams, and Mural. \n\nStudents work together in a Nexus to organize and simulate a scaled product development project. This case study-based class presents common challenges in scaling and more than fifty practices for overcoming them are revealed. \n\nStudents will develop an understanding of how to launch, structure, organize, and manage a large Agile project using Scrum.  They will leave the class with a toolbox of techniques for identifying and overcoming common scaling challenges.\n\nBetween sessions, we provide additional reading, writing, and watching activities to maximise the learning opportunities and complement the classroom experience.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the class, we provide access to a community of peers and continued access to the trainer through office hours, quarterly catchups, and constant engagement.\n\nTo maximise validated learning, all students are given a password to take the SPS assessment, and if they take it within 14 days and are unsuccessful, they will be granted a second attempt. \n\nAs part of our validated learning experience, we provide a 30-minute learning review, a 1h coaching session, and access to future courses at a 30% discount on future classes.",

        "description": "There is no such thing as an Agile Transformation, Digital Transformation, DevOps Transformation, or any of the Whatever Transformation that you can think of or have been sold. You can’t buy agility, and you certainly can’t install it. There is no end state, no optimal outcome, No best practices. We are no longer factory workers.\n\nInstead, you have to grow, nurture, and prune agility as it grows organically inside your organization and eventually, you too will be able to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise in the ever-changing marketplace. This is continuous change…\n\nIts an Evolution, not a transformation.\n\nTranscript/Blog post: https://nkdagility.com/blog/evolution-not-transformation-this-is-the-inevitability-of-change/\n\nAgile Leadership Training: https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?course=11878",

        "description": "Something very close to my heart is helping folks understand the origin of the practices that are commonly used in management today. I feel that only with an understanding of history can we figure out how to change the future. I often talk about this in my classes and help folks see why things are the way that they are in many organisations.\n\nWe are still using workplace practices developed during the industrial revolution to manage factory workers and the mechanisation of those workers. When we had to build at scale but did not have the technology to build robots, it was down to humans to do this monotonous, repetitive work; Think factory floor or typing pool. These practices, envisioned by Frederic Winston Taylor to control workers, are the Tyranny of Taylorism that we battle every day in our working environments.\n\nWhile 81% of all development shops say that they are adopting agile, the reality is far from it; only 22% do short iterations, 16% have ordered backlogs, & 13% do retrospectives! \n\nThey still lack feedback loops.\n\nFeedback loops were not significant when our current management practices were developed. We had defigned work, we understood it very well, and we were optimising a production line. \n\nThose days are gone now!\n\nView Presentation: https://nkdagility.net/30MVagF\n\nDIB Guide: Detecting Agile BS: https://nkdagility.net/DOD-Detecting​",
