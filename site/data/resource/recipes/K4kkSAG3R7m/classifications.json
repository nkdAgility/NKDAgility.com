There is no mention or exploration of human-AI collaboration, enhanced outcomes from joint human-AI agency, or AI agents as team members. The content thoroughly discusses human collective practices but does not address collective intelligence as defined—i.e., the emergence of superior capabilities from human-AI partnerships. While the intended audience (Agile practitioners, Scrum Masters, Product Owners) somewhat overlaps with the target audience for collective intelligence topics, all discussion is strictly human-centric. No relevant direct or indirect references to AI partnership, distributed cognition with AI, or socio-technical human-AI systems are present.",

While it covers collaborative and feedback-driven practices, there are no direct mentions or deep exploration of agentic engineering, developer/AI agency, systemic observability, or DevOps-infused craft. The main focus is on meeting structure and facilitation, not on the deliberate design of engineering practices that maximize agency. Most concepts (e.g., feedback loops, stakeholder involvement) only tangentially align with agentic engineering, and there is no significant philosophical or technical framing around agency, autonomy, or ethical AI. The target audience (Scrum practitioners, facilitators) is somewhat adjacent but does not precisely match the agentic engineering context. No penalties were necessary; there is no obsolete or contradictory tone. Overall, the content fits poorly with the strict criteria for Agentic Engineering.",

Discussion of metrics and feedback loops is limited to sprint-level improvement and does not extend to organization-wide continuous improvement, governance frameworks, or structural alignment between strategy and execution.
