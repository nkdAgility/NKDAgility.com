    "final_score": 46.0,
    "reasoning": "The content critiques the overuse of story points and velocity in Scrum, arguing for transparency, empirical data, and meaningful measures of confidence. While these themes touch on some agentic practices—such as empowering teams to inspect, adapt, and increase agency in delivery approaches—the discussion remains focused on Scrum maturity, metrics, and transparency rather than the broader, philosophical, or systemic topics central to Agentic Engineering (e.g., decentralised decision-making, AI integration, or designing for human/AI agency). No direct mention of Agentic Engineering or its vocabulary occurs. The main audience is technical—Scrum practitioners and coaches—which matches the category, but the content does not fully explore engineer/AI agency or deliberate system design for maximising autonomy. Thus, confidence is moderate: slightly aligned by intent and depth, with clear audience fit, but lacking explicit and deep coverage of core Agentic Engineering tenets.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content advocates for greater transparency and questioning of traditional agile metrics, echoing some values of Agentic Engineering. However, it mainly focuses on Scrum maturity rather than the deliberate, systemic empowerment of human and AI agency, leading to only partial alignment with the category.",

There is, however, no discussion of agentic principles: it does not reference autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or software delivery by agentic means. Its alignment with the target category is minimal; the content is about Scrum practice reform, not agentic software delivery. The closest thematic overlap is a minor reference to improved feedback loops (confidence via transparency), but it lacks any mention or implication of AI, agents, or modern agency-enabled workflows, and does not engage with agentic delivery's core concepts or audience.",
