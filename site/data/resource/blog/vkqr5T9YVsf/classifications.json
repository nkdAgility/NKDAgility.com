The discussion of core Agile values and critique of over-documentation is insightful but treats these as high-level strategies or philosophical preferences—not as explicit first principles. There's some conceptual overlap (e.g., 'working product over documentation'), but it lacks direct, in-depth engagement with first principles theory, definitions, or their explicit application as unbreakable constraints.
