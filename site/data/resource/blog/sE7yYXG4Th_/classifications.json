    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses the implementation of automation within the TFS Automation Platform, focusing on technical details and operational efficiency rather than the intentional shaping of outcomes through agency and adaptability. While there are elements of automation that could relate to agility, the discussion lacks a clear connection to the principles of Agentic Agility, such as intent, accountability, and the interplay between human judgement and AI logic.",
