The audience (technical/organizational leaders) partially overlaps with deployment strategy audiences, but the content's focus is not targeting practitioners of deployment methodology.

There are only brief mentions directly relating dependencies to customer outcomes, but these are not deeply explored or made central to the argument. The primary lens is on organisational design, team structure, ownership, contracts, and reducing delivery risk for the organisation, which can benefit customers indirectly, but the piece does not substantively discuss measuring or prioritising work via customer needs or evidence of customer outcomes. There is conceptual overlap (since eliminating dependencies can improve value delivery), but customer focus is not the primary or explicit driver. The alignment and depth scores are thus moderate, with only a few explicit links to customer value. No penalties apply, as the content is current and non-contradictory.

Key frameworks (Conway's Law, Nexus, Kanban, Evidence-Based Management) referenced are used to illuminate cross-functional operating model choices, not just technical practice. The depth of discussion is high, probing root causes and laying out explicit operational and governance changes. The audience is product/engineering leadership and organizational designers, matching the category. The few places where workflow or technical tooling is mentioned (such as wiki or DevOps platform) are squarely in service of clarity in ownership/governance.
