    "reasoning": "While the content discusses structural ideas (e.g., rejecting specialist teams, leveraging team skills, Communities of Practice), the main focus is practical integration of Design/UX within Scrum, not operating model design or transformation. Concepts of scaling, skills integration, and communities of practice are lightly touching the broader topic but lack direct, explicit, and sustained exploration of operating model structure, transformation, or evaluation at the organizational level. There are no substantial references to value streams, governance, alignment with business strategy, or organizational design principles foundational to the operating model category. Audience and intent remain practitioner-focused (scrum teams, facilitators) rather than those making or evaluating operating model decisions.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on integrating design/UX into Scrum rather than operating model design. Some overlap with team structure and communities of practice, but no direct, substantive exploration of operating model topics. Fit is partial and mostly tangential.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on integrating Design Sprint and UX work within Scrum practices, emphasizing collaborative workflows and cross-functional teams. There is no reference to AI, ML, or product operating models specific to AI; nor are model lifecycle, data governance, or ethical/organizational aspects of AI discussed. Its main themes (eliminating special sprints, integrating specializations, leveraging communities of practice) are rooted in agile and product team dynamics for software generally—not AI products. It targets practitioners interested in agile software delivery, not audiences dealing with AI product operating models.",
