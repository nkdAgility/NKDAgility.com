    "reasoning": "The content covers general Agile product backlog refinement, prioritization, and the value-driven product development process. There is no mention or discussion of AI, machine learning, or unique operating models for AI products. The themes are standard Agile/Scrum principles and product management practices, with no focus on the specialized challenges, governance, or lifecycle of AI solutions. The audience is aligned with product managers and Agile practitioners, but not specifically with those concerned with AI product operating models. No penalties were warranted as the tone and currency are appropriate.",

    "reasoning": "The content solely focuses on Agile practices, especially Product Backlog refinement in Scrum. It makes no direct or indirect reference to the Industrial Operating Model (IOM), its assumptions, mechanics, structures, or historical context. There is no discussion of hierarchical, centralized, or efficiency-focused approaches, nor any contrast with IOM. The audience, purpose, and framing are fully aligned with Agile methods, not IOM. Scoring is accordingly very low across all dimensions. No penalties were applied, as there was no outdated or undermining tone. The confidence score appropriately reflects that the content is almost wholly irrelevant to the IOM category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about Agile Product Backlog management, with no reference to the Industrial Operating Model or its concepts. Does not fit the category; full alignment is absent and intent is unrelated.",
