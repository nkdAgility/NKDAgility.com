While these are closely related to DoD principles (especially quality criteria and completeness of increments), the Definition of Done is never directly mentioned. The discussion aligns conceptually—especially around what constitutes 'working software' and criteria for 'done'—but treats them as general quality/accountability practices rather than the formal DoD artefact. The discussion reaches some depth regarding technical standards and team accountability, discusses stakeholder and developer roles, and references Scrum events but doesn't explicitly detail or exemplify DoD creation, content, best practices, or evolution. The intent is broadly in line (informing practitioners about what quality should look like per Scrum values), but it's not structured as a DoD-specific resource. The audience (Scrum practitioners, teams, organizations) is appropriate, and most content is relevant, with little off-topic material. No penalties are needed as the content is neither outdated nor critical of DoD. No evidence for full exclusion, but the fit is partial, placing it across the midpoint threshold.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on SCRUM team professionalism, accountability, automation, and quality—elements foundational to high-agency engineering teams. While themes like developer accountability, automation, and empiricism overlap with Agentic Engineering (e.g., empowering teams and fostering improvement), the discussion is conventionally rooted in Scrum concepts, not in the broader or explicit framing of maximising human and AI agency. There's scant reference to decentralised decision-making, ethical AI, or feedback-driven adaptation beyond empirical Scrum processes. The lack of explicit terminology or direct mention of Agentic Engineering concepts reduces the confidence. The audience and signal remain high, as the guidance is relevant for practitioners interested in agency within their teams, but the category fit remains partial and not fully intentional.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a detailed advocacy for software quality and professionalism in Scrum delivery, emphasizing developer accountability, automation, CI/CD, and technical excellence. However, nowhere does it mention or substantially discuss agentic concepts: e.g., AI agents, agency, autonomous systems, contextual intelligence, human-agent collaboration, or agent governance. The closest it comes to category relevance is in discussing automation, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps practices—a foundational enabler for agentic delivery, but far removed from the core topics (autonomous agents, human-in-the-loop, agent governance, etc.). The audience (Scrum practitioners) is partially aligned but the core purpose is traditional craftsmanship, not agentic delivery. Penalties were applied for outdated references (2017), lack of conceptual fit, superficial treatment of automation as opposed to agentic intelligence, and irrelevant focus for this category. Thus, the fit is only minimal, scored mainly for foundational engineering practices relevant as prerequisites, not as direct agentic delivery discourse.",
