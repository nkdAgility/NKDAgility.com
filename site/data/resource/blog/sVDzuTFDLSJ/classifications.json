There is no explicit or implicit discussion of the Industrial Operating Model's assumptions, structures, or mechanics. No references are made to hierarchy, Taylorism, functional silos, or efficiency-driven planning typical of IOM. The audience is agile practitioners and Scrum Teams, not those seeking to understand the IOM.
