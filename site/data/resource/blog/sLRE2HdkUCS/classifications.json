However, it is primarily a practical guide for Scrum practitioners on effective Sprint Goal usage, not an exploration of the design, governance, or organizational structure that a Product Operating Model entails. Topics like portfolio management, operating model frameworks, or deep governance mechanisms are absent. There is partial conceptual alignment in discussing how Product Owners align tactical steps with strategic goals, but this falls short of substantive Product Operating Model discourse.
