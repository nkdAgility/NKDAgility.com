    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly explores immersive vs. traditional learning in Agile and Scrum training but does not explicitly discuss organizational operating models—structures, people-process-technology alignment, or value streams. 'Operating model' is not directly mentioned, nor is there a systemic analysis of how an organization's way of working or learning aligns with its business strategy or delivery model. The closest alignment is at the team or training practice level; discussion centers on the methods, formats, and effectiveness of learning, not the design or evolution of operating models. Audience is partially aligned (Agile practitioners, some decision-makers), but depth on operating model topics is low. Thus, the fit to 'Operating Model' is poor.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content focuses on immersive learning formats in Agile training, not on the design or transformation of organizational operating models. There's little to no direct or in-depth discussion of operating model concepts, so category fit is weak.",

No content intersects with the unique requirements, lifecycle, governance, or management of AI products as outlined in the scoring rubric. No AI-specific challenges, scaling strategies, data governance, or ethical AI considerations are discussed; thus, the alignment and depth are minimal. There is no signal relevant to AI or product operating models for AI solutions.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on the contrast between traditional (classroom-based, lecture-driven) and immersive approaches to Agile learning. While 'traditional' learning is discussed, there are no explicit references or in-depth analysis of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM) as defined. The text makes some implicit connections—such as describing traditional formats as established, rigid, standardized, and less adaptive—but it never directly discusses IOM's structural assumptions, vertical decision-making, hierarchy, or Taylorism. The purpose is to advocate for immersive learning for Agile rather than to explain or substantively explore IOM. Brief mentions of 'traditional' methods do not significantly align with the IOM category, and the discussion doesn't target the senior/structural audience interested in operating models—it targets Agile practitioners and educators. There's also minimal depth tying 'traditional learning' specifically to IOM's organizational structures or strengths; instead, the bias is toward moving away from these methods.",
