Only indirect nods to underlying core principles (e.g., need for empiricism, rejection of command-and-control) are present, but these are framed as lessons/best practices, not as immutable constraints.

The target audience aligns loosely due to its strategic leadership focus, but without specifically targeting OKR practitioners.
