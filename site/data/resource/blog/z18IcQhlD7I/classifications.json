    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of Agentic Engineering or its terminology are absent; concepts like agency, autonomy, DevOps, and continuous delivery are referenced only tangentially. The focus is strictly on Definition of Done practices in Scrum, with emphasis on quality, responsibility, automation, and iterative improvement. Some overlap exists with agentic topics (developer autonomy, quality through automation), but ethical AI integration, decentralization, or systemic observability are not substantively discussed. The purpose is practitioner-oriented and targets a technical audience, but explores only traditional Scrum/Agile practices, not their deliberate design to maximize agency for humans or intelligent systems.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This material directly addresses Definition of Done in Scrum, focusing on software quality, automation, and team responsibility. While there are themes adjacent to agentic concepts, it lacks deliberate discussion of maximizing human or AI agency and doesn't explicitly relate to Agentic Engineering.",

    "reasoning": "The content doesn't explicitly mention agentic software delivery or its key concepts (autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent collaboration, etc.). Instead, it focuses on how to develop and continuously improve a Definition of Done within Scrum practice, emphasizing quality and transparency. There are small references to automation (e.g., automated checks, tests, DevOps), but not in the context of autonomous, context-aware agents or their integration into delivery processes. Discussion remains at the level of Scrum roles, workshops, and standard engineering practices. There is no substantial or thematic alignment with agentic principles, nor is the purpose relevant. The audience (Scrum teams, practitioners) might overlap with agentic delivery's audience, but the topic is almost entirely unrelated beyond superficial overlaps with automation and DevOps.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is squarely about basic Scrum practice, with no discussion of agentic software delivery, AI agents, or context-aware automation. Fit is poor, with only slight overlap via mentions of automation and DevOps.",
