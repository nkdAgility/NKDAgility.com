However, it stops short of explicitly referencing 'Agentic Engineering' or its specialized frameworks (e.g., AI/human co-agency, automation, or AI-augmented decision-making), sticking mainly to human agency and cultural change rather than broader engineering constructs. Thus, while it strongly aligns with certain tenets—particularly developer agency, feedback-driven adaptation, and cultural prerequisites for agency—it lacks direct mention and comprehensive coverage of agentic engineering's technical and philosophical breadth. The discussion is thoughtfully targeted at practitioners interested in cultural, process, and team agency, but narrower than the full category definition.",
