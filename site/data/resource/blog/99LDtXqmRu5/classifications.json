While this can indirectly support cultural qualities like collaboration and transparency, there is little direct or deep discussion about organisational culture, cultural change, leadership, or team dynamics as defined for this category. The piece does not examine culture as a primary theme—rather, it stays tethered to process, artifacts, and practical implementation. It is thus only moderately aligned conceptually and shallow in cultural depth, though team focus and shared understanding are touched upon. The audience (Scrum teams, Product Owners, Agile practitioners) overlaps somewhat with the category's intended audience, which boosts that dimension. The signal is reasonably high since little is off-topic. There is no discussion of outdated practices or contrary tone, so no penalty is needed.",

    "reasoning": "Direct references to 'Product Operating Model' are absent; the content focuses on the Sprint Goal's purpose within Scrum, providing examples and links to the Product Goal. While Sprint and Product Goals are elements in modern product management, the article does not address structural, governance, or cross-functional aspects central to a product operating model. There is a loose conceptual connection—Sprint Goal supports focus and alignment, which supports broader product delivery workflows—but the main intent, depth, and discussion center on team-level tactical practices (Scrum), not operating model design or evolution. Audience is Scrum practitioners, not organizational designers or executives. Most content is relevant to Sprint Goals specifically, providing some indirect overlap but not enough for a high-fit classification.",
