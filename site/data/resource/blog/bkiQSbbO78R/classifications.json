    "reasoning": "The content is focused on modern source control, DevOps, automation, and professional practices. While it discusses modern engineering practices (CI/CD, automated testing), organizational context, and the integration of tools, it lacks explicit or implicit mention of autonomous AI agents, agentic principles, or context-aware intelligence. No agency, AI-driven delivery, or embedding of agentic behaviors is found. The fit is only partial, mainly due to overlaps in progressive software engineering, feedback loops, and mentions of telemetry, but without grounding in agentic concepts or AI. Audience and signal-to-noise are strong, but the core topic is misaligned with the category definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Primarily about modern DevOps and source control, this content lacks relevance to agentic or autonomous AI in delivery. While it mentions automation, CI/CD, and telemetry, it does not cover agentic principles. Only a partial, tangential fit.",
