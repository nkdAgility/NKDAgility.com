    "final_score": 35.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the shift from in-person to live virtual classroom training in response to crisis conditions and explores technological adaptation, improved participation, and operational benefits. However, it does not substantially discuss operating model components (roles, governance, value streams, alignment with business strategy, or organizational design) at an organizational level. The perspective is limited to training delivery rather than exploring how the fundamental 'way we work' is structured in organizations. There is slight conceptual overlap in discussing adaptation and a 'new normal,' but it lacks substantive depth or explicit intent toward operating model principles, case studies, or evaluation of change in a systemic, organizational sense.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Primarily discusses virtual training formats and adaptation to remote learning, but does not directly address organizational operating model design or transformation. Some minor overlap, but fit is weak and mostly tangential.",

    "reasoning": "The content exclusively discusses live virtual classroom adoption, remote training effectiveness, and related technology in the context of general business adaptation. There are no mentions or exploration of AI-specific product operating models, practices, roles, data/model governance, ethical considerations, or how organizations structure the end-to-end lifecycle of AI products. The examples revolve around remote education logistics and participant experiences, with passing reference to Scrum and product delivery as related to virtual work—not as operating models for AI products. The content’s audience is primarily trainers and organizations transitioning to virtual learning, rather than decision-makers, leaders, or practitioners interested in AI product operationalization.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is unrelated to AI Product Operating Models—focus is on remote training and virtual classrooms, not AI product lifecycle, governance, or organizational operating models for AI.",
