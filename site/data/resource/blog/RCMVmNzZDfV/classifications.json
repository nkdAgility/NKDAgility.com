The audience and purpose are squarely geared toward practitioners of modern Agile product delivery, not toward understanding traditional industrial structures or processes. Thus, neither the topic nor the themes match the IOM category, and the fit is minimal—reflected in very low scores across all dimensions.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content centers on Scrum team practices and modern Agile workflow, not on the Industrial Operating Model. It does not help understand what IOM is or where it works, so fit with the category is very weak.",
    "level": "Ignored"
