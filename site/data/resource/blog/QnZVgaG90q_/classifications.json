    "reasoning": "The content centers on redefining co-location in light of technological advances, promoting video presence for more effective online communication in teams. While it references shifts in how teams collaborate (potentially relevant to operating models), it does not substantially explore broader organizational structure, governance, roles, or explicit operating model design. The main focus is on practical team dynamics and etiquette in a virtual context, which aligns only peripherally with the operating model category and mostly at the level of working practices, not structural or systemic change. The audience may be practitioners interested in modern collaboration, not those specifically seeking operating model insights.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content describes evolved co-location and online team presence, not operating models. Mentions of structure/process are incidental; main focus is communication etiquette and tech use. Only weak or tangential fit for 'Operating Model' category.",

    "reasoning": "The content extensively discusses how technology (not AI-specific) and video presence have impacted the definition of co-location for remote teams, focusing on team engagement, communication, and agile practices. It never mentions AI, artificial intelligence, or product operating models. There is no discussion of any AI product lifecycle, MLOps, AI-specific governance, or organizational practices unique to AI product delivery. Its themes fit agile team operations and virtual collaboration, not the operationalization of AI by organizations. No penalties applied as it is not outdated nor critical in tone.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on redefining co-location in online/virtual contexts and emphasizes effective video presence for communication and engagement. There is no discussion or analysis of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM), its assumptions, structures, history, or direct comparison with adaptive models. At most, a tangential allusion to 'established practices' appears when referencing traditional, in-person co-location, but this does not engage with IOM concepts or mechanics. The core themes—technology, team practices, participation norms—are about modern collaboration rather than IOM's hierarchical, efficiency-driven structures. The intent is to help online teams improve communication, not to elucidate the IOM.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is almost entirely unrelated to the Industrial Operating Model; it focuses on virtual co-location and team engagement, never exploring IOM themes, structures, or relevance. Fit with the category is extremely weak and only tangential at best.",
