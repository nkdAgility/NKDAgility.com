    "reasoning": "The content addresses how organizations can structure Product Owner roles across multiple Scrum teams at scale within Nexus, including delegation, hierarchical structures (Area Owner, Team Owner), and communication. This reflects significant aspects of Product Operating Model such as roles, governance, collaboration, and alignment of product strategy with execution. However, the core framing is on role management within Scrum/Nexus rather than on a full operating model design, and deeper discussion into tooling, metrics, and continuous improvement is limited. Audience fit is strong (Scrum practitioners, organizational leaders) and the content maintains clear relevance to scaling and structuring for value delivery. Mentions of 'operating model' are not explicit, but the conceptual alignment is high due to the structural and governance focus.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions to 'operating model' are absent, as most references are about Scrum roles and scaling Product Owner participation. The content touches on scaling structures and delegation, aligning partially with operating model discussion (e.g., hierarchy, division of responsibility, cross-team coordination). However, it does not deeply analyze or frame these mechanisms in terms of organizational operating model design, transformation, or value delivery principles. The discussion stays team- and role-focused with practical examples, thus offering some but limited broader organizational insights. Audience skews toward Scrum practitioners and team leads rather than strategists. S/N ratio is moderate: focus wanders to role delegation, ways of managing meetings, and tool analogies.",

All practices and examples center on general product/scaling topics, not the unique structures of AI product operating models.
