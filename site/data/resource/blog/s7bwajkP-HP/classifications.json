    "reasoning": "The content focuses on integrating UX into Scrum teams, specifically within the context of Professional Scrum and UX practices. There are no explicit or implicit references to agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, proactive contextual intelligence, or the integration of autonomous agents and human expertise as described in the category definition. The main themes pertain strictly to traditional Scrum and UX, with no mention of AI-driven delivery enhancements, human-in-the-loop agent frameworks, or modern autonomous delivery practices. The target audience (Scrum practitioners/UX professionals) is only loosely related, as the topic is not relevant to agentic delivery. No penalty deductions were required as the content is neither outdated nor contradictory; it is simply off-topic.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content does not fit the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category. It addresses UX in Scrum teams without reference to AI agents, autonomous delivery, or contextual intelligence as required for this classification.",
