There are no explicit mentions or implicit evidence of human-AI collaboration, AI agent involvement, or the main concepts framed by 'Collective Intelligence.' The example solely addresses rapid responsiveness in project contexts and omits key dimensions like distributed cognition, shared human-AI outcomes, or collaborative frameworks. The target audience could align with Agile practitioners, but the message is overly general and not directly related to the core category. No penalties were needed as there is no evidence of outdated nor contradictory content.",
