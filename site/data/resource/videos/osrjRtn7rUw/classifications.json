    "reasoning": "The content critiques tech hype and advocates for evidence-based leadership and decision-making but never references AI, AI product operating models, or the unique governance, workflow, or lifecycle challenges of AI products. Its focus is general technology management (e.g., whether to choose Kubernetes), not managing or operating AI solutions. There is no discussion of AI-specific roles, data/model governance, MLOps, or ethical considerations. While the audience (tech executives) overlaps, and some general principles (evidence-based, clarity, fit over fashion) are adjacent to operating model concerns, the content does not address anything particular to AI or AI product operationalization.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content discusses evidence-based tech leadership and decision-making generally, without reference to AI or product operating models. It does not fit the AI Product Operating Model category except through very indirect, generic principles.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on evidence-based leadership and resisting tech hype, aiming at tech leaders. It discusses strategic technology choices rather than the structure, mechanics, or historical context of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM). There are no direct references or deep discussions of IOM concepts like hierarchy, standardization, or command-and-control mechanisms. The main audience (tech executives) may overlap with IOM relevance, but the material is not about the IOM or its effectiveness. Only a nominal, tangential alignment exists due to faint overlap in decision-making and process visibility themes.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content does not discuss or analyze the Industrial Operating Model. It focuses on evidence-based tech decisions and resisting trends, not IOM structure or its traditional strengths. Category fit is highly limited and mostly incidental.",
