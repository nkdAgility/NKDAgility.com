    "final_score": 22.0,
    "reasoning": "This content focuses on product development challenges, specifically assumption management, experimentation, and navigating complexity. While it encourages evidence-based decision-making, empirical cycles (Discovery-Delivery-Validation), and continuous improvement—concepts present in modern delivery—the content does not mention or discuss agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, integration of contextual intelligence, or any related key topics. No technical specifics, governance frameworks, or engineering practices tied to agentic paradigms appear. The audience (product leaders, owners, teams) somewhat overlaps with the agentic delivery audience, and content is relevant, but the fit is mostly tangential. No satire or outdated material, so no penalties.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content discusses modern product development and evidence-based techniques but does not address or align with Agentic Software Delivery, lacking references to AI agents, agentic principles, or related practices. Only partial thematic overlap.",
    "level": "Ignored"
