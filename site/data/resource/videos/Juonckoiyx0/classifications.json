None of the sections touch on Agile metrics, Kanban theory, or anything specific to SLE as defined in the classification scope. There is passing mention of 'transparency' and 'continuous improvement,' but these are general Agile themes, not linked to SLE or its operationalization. Audience alignment is low because the advice is more for Scrum practitioners seeking better reviews rather than those interested in flow metrics or predictive delivery.
