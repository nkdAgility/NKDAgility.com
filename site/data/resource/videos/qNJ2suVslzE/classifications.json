    "reasoning": "The content focuses on transforming scope creep through Agile and Lean, emphasizing value delivery and adaptability. While it discusses feedback, dynamic planning, and moving away from old paradigms, there is no mention of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or embedding intelligence into delivery systems. The core topics are classic Agile, not agentic systems. Content depth is centered on agile adaptation, not agent integration or human-in-the-loop AI practices. The intended audience (teams dealing with scope creep, Agile practitioners) overlaps slightly. There is almost no noise, but the main themes do not touch on agentic software delivery core concepts.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is about Agile response to scope creep, adaptation, and value, but it lacks references to agentic systems, AI-driven automation, or agent/practitioner synergy. Fit with 'Agentic Software Delivery' is minimal—conceptual overlap is indirect at best.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses product delivery practices in dynamic markets, focusing on turning scope creep into a value-driven Agile approach. There are several conceptual overlaps with product operating model themes: shifting from fixed plans to adaptive delivery, prioritizing customer value, integrating feedback loops, and embracing agility. However, the discussion does not explicitly cover the design, structure, or governance of product operating models, or how roles, processes, or technologies align product strategy with execution. The content is practitioner-oriented, referencing Agile, Lean, and product delivery but stays within operational advice on managing scope, not structuring the overall product operating model. No terms like 'operating model', organizational design, governance, or product team structures are mentioned, though the intent to improve value delivery resonates with the aim of operating models. There is some indirect alignment, but it is partial and not explicit. A penalty was assigned to 'mentions' due to a lack of direct reference to the category.",

There is no explicit mention of operating models; nor is there any substantial exploration of organizational structure, governance, or operating model transformation. While themes like 'embracing agility,' 'dynamic planning,' and 'value delivery' could loosely connect to broader operating model change, all discussion is firmly situated in team-level or methodology-based practices, not structural, organizational, or governance-level concerns.
