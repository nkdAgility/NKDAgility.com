While it emphasizes leadership transformation, delegation, and data-driven decision making, direct references to customer outcomes, feedback loops, or delivering measurable customer value are lacking. There are some relevant mentions of aligning work and organizational outcomes but these remain high-level and internal-facing, not focused explicitly on customer value as required by the classification. The target audience (managers transitioning to leadership) aligns, and there is some conceptual overlap with customer focus through measurement and outcome orientation, but the discussion is mostly about internal effectiveness rather than customer impact. This limits both the depth and alignment scores. No penalties are warranted.",
