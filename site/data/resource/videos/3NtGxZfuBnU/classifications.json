Examples like Sutherland's book and references to organizational learning, as well as 'how-to' roadmaps for cultural shift, further reinforce conceptual fit. The discussion is insightful and substantial, though it is somewhat abstract and thematic rather than an explicit practical guide, which is why scores for depth and direct mention are slightly below maximum.
