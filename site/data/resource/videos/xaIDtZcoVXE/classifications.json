    "reasoning": "The content focuses on measuring and improving Time to Market in Agile teams using Evidence-Based Management (EBM), covering relevant metrics (lead time, cycle time, etc.), and improvement techniques like automation and feedback loops. While these are tangentially related to agentic concepts (developer agency, feedback-driven change), there are no direct mentions or explicit exploration of agentic engineering's philosophy—such as deliberate design for human/AI agency, ethical AI integration, or decentralised decision-making frameworks. The main themes align with continuous improvement and DevOps-infused craft, but only as secondary effects of improved delivery metrics, not as core objectives. Discussion of agency or systemic observability is implied but not explicit or deeply developed. The target audience (Agile teams, practitioners) matches that of agentic engineering, and the content is largely focused, but falls short on depth and intent for the specific category.",

There is no explicit mention or exploration of agentic principles, boundaries for AI agency, governance of AI agents, or agentic transformation in delivery models.

However, it does not directly address the structural or governance aspects of operating models, organizational design, or frameworks for product delivery governance. The primary audience (Agile practitioners, team leads) overlaps with the category, and the content is highly relevant to practitioners interested in product delivery efficiency. 'Product Operating Model' is not mentioned explicitly; the framing is actionable for teams rather than abstracted to the full organizational approach typical of true operating model discussions. Thus, the fit is partial: strong on relevant practices, weaker on structural/organizational model depth.",
