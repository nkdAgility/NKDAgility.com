    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly explains measuring and improving Time to Market in Agile teams via metrics like lead time and cycle time, focusing on Evidence-Based Management and efficiency. It mentions automation and continuous feedback loops, which partially align with modern engineering practices noted in Agentic Software Delivery, but it never discusses the integration or role of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agency, or human-agent collaboration. There is no explicit mention or exploration of agentic principles, boundaries for AI agency, governance of AI agents, or agentic transformation in delivery models. The audience and advice are somewhat indirectly relevant (technical, improvement-oriented), but the fit is partial, as 'agentic' themes are outside the core of this piece.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on Agile metrics and time to market, not agentic software delivery. No mention of autonomous agents or agentic context. Partial alignment with some engineering practices, but lacks core agentic themes.",
