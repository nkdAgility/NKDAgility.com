    "reasoning": "The content discusses Kanban as a strategy for optimizing team workflows and predictability, referencing improvements in transparency and delivery across diverse teams (including portfolio management and manufacturing). However, it does not address the design, governance, or organizational structures central to the Product Operating Model category. There are no explicit or conceptual links to cross-functional product team structures, governance mechanisms, or broader alignment of strategy with execution. The focus remains at the team and practice level rather than on product operating model frameworks or organization-wide transformation, thus only partially aligning (audience overlap but not topic depth).",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses almost exclusively on Kanban as a workflow optimization strategy at the team level. It frequently references principles aligned with process improvement, transparency, and predictability but does not directly mention or analyze operating models, organizational structure, cross-functional value streams, or broader governance concerns. There's emphasis on universal applicability ('any team, any context'), yet all examples and recommendations remain at the workflow/practitioner layer rather than exploring Kanban's integration into organizational design or operating model transformation. There are no strong direct mentions of operating models, nor a depth of discussion on foundational operating model principles, decision rights, or strategic alignment beyond improving 'workflow' and stakeholder trust at the team-process level. The content's main intent is to inspire adoption of Kanban—not to evaluate or design an operating model.",
