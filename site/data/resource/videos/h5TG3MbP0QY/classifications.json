    "reasoning": "The content centers on honesty, transparency, and moral integrity in Scrum—concepts strongly encouraged within Agile but treated here as moral imperatives. However, it never explicitly identifies these as 'first principles' or foundational immutable constraints as defined by theorists; instead, it frames them as professional obligations or ideals rather than untouchable, system-defining axioms. There's no analytical discussion differentiating first principles from heuristics or derived values, nor explicit reference to primary sources outlining first principles in Scrum or Agile. The audience and intent fit reasonably well (PSM 1 learners and practitioners), but depth and alignment are diluted by the lack of explicit first principles discourse. The piece stands as a passionate call for integrity but falls short of methodically anchoring these virtues in first principle doctrine.",
