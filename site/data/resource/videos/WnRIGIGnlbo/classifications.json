While the phrase 'strategic alignment' directly references the key theme, the depth on long-term strategic objectives is moderate—the focus is on decision frameworks, disciplined leadership, and alignment rather than articulating or measuring business agility or strategic goals themselves. It targets executive/leadership (CTOs), aligning the audience, and much of the language is relevant to strategic decision-making in an agile context. However, the main thrust is practical frameworks for tech adoption, not a deep exploration of strategic objectives or metrics for ongoing business agility, so depth and mentions are not maximal.",
