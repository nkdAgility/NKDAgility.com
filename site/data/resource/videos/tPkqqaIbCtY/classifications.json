While 'continuous improvement' is a theme in enterprise agility, the article does not discuss organisational agility, scaled frameworks, leadership, change management, or broader agile transformations. There is no explicit mention of enterprise-level agility concepts, organisational culture, or leadership roles beyond direct user-product relationships. The audience is probably product practitioners rather than executives or agile strategists, and the discussion remains on the product/user plane rather than enterprise systems. Fit is partial at best, with only tangential reference to continuous improvement that overlaps with enterprise agility principles.",
