There is minimal or no explicit mention of 'operating model,' no connection to broader structure/governance, and limited depth on how these concepts impact or reflect organizational operating model transformation or design. The discussion is practical for Agile teams but falls short of addressing how organizations structure 'the way we work'—a core requirement for full categorization. Audience is somewhat aligned (practitioners/consultants), but the content remains too focused on process optimization rather than enterprise operating model.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content discusses process concepts (resource/flow efficiency) at a team or practice level. Organizational operating model themes are not explicit; fit with the category is partial and mostly indirect.",

There is no mention—direct or indirect—of AI, operating models specific to AI products, or any unique considerations of AI Product Operating Models such as AI lifecycle, data/model governance, or scaling AI in organizations. The examples center on general Agile practices, organizational workflow, and human resource dynamics. The only remotely related terms are general product roles (Product Owner) and workflow concepts but not tied to AI. All six dimensions receive very low scores, mainly for faint overlap in audience or conceptual backdrop (Agile), without any direct, substantive, or intentional connection to the AI Product Operating Model category.",
