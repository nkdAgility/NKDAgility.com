However, it never directly mentions Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it reference any related metrics, historical cycle time, or Kanban/Scrum SLE practices. There is a thematic overlap in the focus on predictability and stakeholder trust, which are purposes SLE also aims to improve, but the technical concept of SLE is neither defined, calculated, discussed, nor even named. The entire text orients tightly to Definition of Done as a quality threshold, not to forecasting cycle times or probabilistic delivery windows. Thus, alignment, depth, and intent scores are very low. The audience (Agile teams, coaches, stakeholders) does somewhat match the typical SLE audience, so that is scored higher.
