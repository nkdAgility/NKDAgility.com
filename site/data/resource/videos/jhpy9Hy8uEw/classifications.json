While referencing ethos and its impact, much of the discussion still focuses on practical aspects (certification cost, progression, community). There is moderate depth in discussing how genuine ethos distinguishes one organization from another, linking system behavior (e.g., community sharing, feedback, response to challenges) as evidence of underlying convictions. The audience is Scrum practitioners and decision-makers, fitting the category, and the signal-to-noise ratio is high, though there are promotional and descriptive sections not strongly tied to ethos. Confidence is solid due to repeated direct references and detailed rationale, but not maximal as the discussion also integrates practical and operational topics without always tying them to system-level convictions.",
