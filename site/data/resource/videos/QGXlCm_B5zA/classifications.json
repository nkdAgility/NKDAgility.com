    "reasoning": "The content focuses on advanced Scrum Master practices, team empowerment, and Scrum/Agile facilitation. It does not mention or address AI, AI product lifecycles, or operating models specific to AI product delivery. No references to model governance, AI-specific roles, or organizational integration of AI exist. Audience and themes are for Agile/Scrum practitioners, not for those responsible for operationalizing AI products. The tangential mention of DevOps is not contextualized for AI. Thus, there is extremely weak to no alignment with the 'AI Product Operating Model' category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content centers on Scrum Master roles in Agile teams, unrelated to AI or AI Product Operating Model. No AI context, model lifecycle, or governance discussed. Does not fit the intended category.",
