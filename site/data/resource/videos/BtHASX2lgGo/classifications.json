    "reasoning": "The content focuses primarily on critiquing burndown charts and Sprint planning practices within agile teams. While it mentions organizational habits and touches on ways of working, it does not substantively discuss organizational operating models, structural design, or transformations at a broad or strategic level. The discussion is mostly at the team or process level, making only broad references to workflow and value flow. There is minimal explicit or implicit reference to the design, adaptation, or evaluation of operating models as defined in the category. As such, the fit is weak, with only tangential relevance to operating model concepts.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is narrowly focused on agile team practices (burndown charts, minimal planning), not organizational operating models. Lacks substantial discussion of structure/design or transformation at the operating model level; relevance is marginal.",

    "reasoning": "The content explicitly discusses agile practices (burndown charts, Sprint planning, continuous flow) but never references AI, AI products, or operating models specific to AI. Concepts mentioned are general Agile/Product Operating Model practices without connection to AI-specific requirements, governance, roles, or lifecycle. The audience may overlap with those interested in AI operating models, but there is no substantive linkage to AI Product Operating Model themes. No outdated or contradictory practices were noted, so no penalties applied. Overall, the fit is extremely weak and only gets minimal points for faint indirect relevance to operating models in a generic sense.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content solely discusses general agile team planning, not AI products or operating models. Does not fit the AI Product Operating Model category—no AI-specific content or context present.",
