    "reasoning": "The content provides a thoughtful and detailed exploration of Scrum as a mirror for organizational improvement and transparency. However, it lacks any direct or even indirect references to autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agentic delivery practices, or synergy between AI and human roles, all essential to the Agentic Software Delivery category. Its themes sit firmly within classical Scrum and agile process improvement, focusing on human transparency and feedback loops but showing no engagement with agentic concepts or supporting technologies. The small scores for alignment and depth recognize some overlap in feedback loops and continuous improvement, but these are generic agile traits, not agentic specifics. Audience and signal are higher as it is targeted at practitioners seeking delivery improvement, but virtually all content remains outside the agentic scope.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is focused entirely on traditional Scrum practices and continuous improvement, with no mention or exploration of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery concepts. Weak-to-no fit with 'Agentic Software Delivery.'",
