    "reasoning": "This content focuses on Agile principles, technical leadership, and engineering excellence. It discusses unpredictability in software delivery and strategies like Agile, Scrum, and continuous delivery/testing. However, it does not mention Agentic Software Delivery, nor does it discuss autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agent integration with human teams, or agentic governance frameworks. The concepts discussed—while modern and relevant to high-performing teams—are rooted in traditional Agile and engineering best practices rather than the integration of proactive AI agents as per the category's definition. The intended audience (technical leaders, engineers) aligns with the category, and most content is focused and relevant for them, but not for the explicit agentic context.",

    "reasoning": "The content emphasizes Agile principles, technical leadership, and engineering excellence as approaches to navigate unpredictability in software development. While it discusses leadership, team adaptation, iterative work, and feedback loops, it never directly addresses product operating models, their structural elements, governance, organizational structures, or cross-functional alignment as defined in the category. There is no mention of frameworks for roles, explicit alignment of strategy and execution, governance, portfolio management, or technological support structures. The audience is partly aligned (technical leaders), and topics like continuous delivery/feedback have mild conceptual overlap, but the article focuses on team-level practices and general Agile mindset, not the design/evolution of operating models. No penalties apply because the content doesn't undermine the category or reference obsolete practices.",
