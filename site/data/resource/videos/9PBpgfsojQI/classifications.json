While it discusses effective behaviors and the importance of investing in people and ways of working, it rarely explores the foundational beliefs or system-level convictions that constitute ethos. References to 'toxic practices' and genuine improvement align somewhat with ethos, but the discussion remains at the level of recommendations and outcomes, not a deep dive into organizational convictions or values underpinning sustainable agility. There are minor direct or conceptual ties, but the discussion is more action- and results-focused than ethos-driven.",
