The material is entirely focused on traditional agile improvement and coaching, not on algorithmic or agent-driven delivery. The closest relevancy is peripheral: mentions of backlog, feedback, and CI/CD-adjacent agile practices, but these lack any context of agentic software delivery as defined.

Key dimensions such as end-to-end lifecycle management, governance, or technology support in product operating models are not deeply covered.
