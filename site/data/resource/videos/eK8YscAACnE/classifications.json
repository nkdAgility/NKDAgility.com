It does not mention, address, or contextualize AI product operating models, AI lifecycle management, AI governance, or any domain-specific to AI products. The focus remains solely on general Agile team practices and healthier collaboration metrics. No reference is made to the unique operational requirements, structures, or governance of AI-enabled products. The audience is practitioners of Agile—in general, not AI product teams specifically. Therefore, while the discussion is organizational, there is negligible overlap with the AI Product Operating Model scope.",
