    "reasoning": "The content discusses Agile consulting, focusing on practical strategies, continuous learning, and improvement. While it occasionally references mindset and empowerment, it rarely connects them to foundational, demonstrable system ethos as defined. The focus rests on tools, coaching, and adapting strategies, but there's little exploration of ethos as the underpinning of system behavior. Multiple sections discuss practices and mindset in general terms without explicit links to ethos. Audience alignment is relatively high (consultants/practitioners), and there is moderate signal, but direct mentions and deep engagement with ethos are limited.",

While there’s some conceptual overlap—such as referencing feedback loops and value delivery—these points are not deeply discussed with explicit linkage to defining, measuring, or prioritising based on customer outcomes. The depth remains moderate, as content focuses broadly on Agile Consulting practices, continuous learning, and organisational change, but lacks thorough exploration of customer metrics or data-driven insight frameworks fundamental to Customer Focus. The main intent is to describe Agile Consulting holistically rather than anchor the discussion tightly to customer value as the primary agile driver. Audience alignment is reasonably high (agile practitioners and organisational leaders), and the content is generally relevant, though not tightly focused. No penalties were applied since tone and content are current and neutral.",
