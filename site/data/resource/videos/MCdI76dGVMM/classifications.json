    "reasoning": "The content is focused exclusively on professionalism and mastery in Scrum Master roles, emphasizing personal learning, deep understanding, and commitment to the Scrum philosophy. It does not make any direct or indirect reference to agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, human–AI collaboration, contextual intelligence, or any of the core themes outlined in the 'Agentic Software Delivery' classification. It targets Scrum practitioners in a traditional coaching/support context, without touching on AI, automation, or agentic principles. There are no penalties, as the content is not outdated or contrary, but it remains wholly misaligned with the given category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about personal professionalism in Scrum Mastery, not agentic software delivery. It neither discusses AI agents nor the principles of agentic integration, and thus does not fit the category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
