    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on contrasting traditional management with evidence-based management (EBM). It discusses the pitfalls of vanity metrics, emphasizes outcome-based measurement, and the need to validate assumptions with real data. However, it never references OKRs, their definitions, principles, or implementation, nor does it cite John Doerr or related strategic goal-setting frameworks. While some concepts such as outcome alignment, meaningful metrics, and continuous improvement echo OKR philosophy, these are explored through the lens of EBM, not as part of the OKR system. The content is well-aligned with evidence-based practices but does not fit the precise scope or terminology required for the 'Objective Key Results' category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content explains evidence-based management and outcome-focused measurement but does not mention or explore OKRs. Although some concepts overlap, it is not a discussion of Objective Key Results and is therefore not a suitable fit for that category.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses extensively on evidence-based management versus traditional management, emphasizing data-driven decision-making, usage of valuable metrics, and continuous improvement. While these correlate with some philosophical underpinnings of Agentic Engineering—such as decentralizing decisions and feedback-driven adaptation—the article never directly refers to agency (neither for developers nor AI), DevOps-infused craft, ethical AI integration, or engineering practices that maximize human/AI autonomy. There's a moderate conceptual overlap in terms of striving for empirical, systemic improvement and feedback loops, but the discussion remains at a management/process level. No explicit mention or depth about engineering methodologies, developer autonomy, observability, or AI-human collaboration, so most Agentic Engineering core themes are absent.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content provides a thorough exploration of evidence-based management, reflecting some Agentic Engineering principles like feedback-driven adaptation and systemic impact. However, it lacks explicit focus on engineering agency, autonomy, and AI integration, making alignment partial and indirect.",

There is no direct mention of autonomous AI agents, agentic systems, or agentic principles in software delivery. The closest match is the focus on evidence and metrics, but this is firmly within a managerial/leadership and Agile improvement context, not agentic systems. There are no references to intelligent agents, human-agent collaboration, agency, context-aware intelligence, or governance of agentic systems. The audience, intent, depth, and alignment all firmly target management practice evolution, not Agentic Software Delivery as defined. Thus, confidence is extremely low, reflecting only the slight thematic overlap with improvement and evidence-driven practices.",
