    "final_score": 14.0,
    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses product ownership, marketing the vision, stakeholder engagement, and backlog management—important for general product delivery. However, the piece lacks any direct mention or substantial exploration of operating models, principles, or unique requirements pertaining to AI products. There are no references to AI, ML, MLOps, data/model governance, AI ethics/compliance, or organizational structures for AI product operationalization. Concepts like team roles, value delivery, and feedback loops are covered, but exclusively from a traditional product ownership or Scrum perspective. The audience and themes only partially overlap with AI Product Operating Model, and only as far as baseline roles and feedback mechanisms are universal. Thus, the fit is superficial and mostly unrelated to the AI-specific scope required by the category definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is focused on traditional product ownership and stakeholder alignment, with no discussion of AI-specific operating models, requirements, or practices. Fit with the AI Product Operating Model category is minimal and mostly coincidental.",
    "level": "Ignored"
