    "reasoning": "The content meaningfully challenges common misconceptions about the Scrum Master role by advocating for empowerment, self-sufficiency, and moving beyond superficial practices. While it doesn't directly name 'ethos' or overtly explore foundational system convictions, it does indirectly reference ethos-like principles through its critique of ritualistic roles and emphasis on genuine team value. Some surface-level promotional content and absence of direct system-level value discussion lower the depth and direct mentions scores. No penalties were warranted.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article goes beyond task descriptions, encouraging Scrum Masters to transcend rituals and cultivate authentic team empowerment. While not directly labeled as 'ethos,' its strong focus on underlying beliefs and behaviors moderately aligns with the Ethos category, earning a fair confidence score.",
