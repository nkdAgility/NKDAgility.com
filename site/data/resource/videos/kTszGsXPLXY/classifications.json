There is no reference to AI, AI product lifecycle, AI operating models, or related structures. Key category concepts—like integrating AI product teams, operationalizing AI model lifecycles, or governing AI-specific development—are entirely absent. The audience, topics, intent, and examples are all focused on generic process optimization for teams using Kanban, making any fit with the AI Product Operating Model category negligible. No penalties are applied as there is no outdated or contradicting tone.",

    "reasoning": "The content exclusively focuses on introducing Kanban at the team level (workflows, metrics, continuous improvement, overcoming resistance). It does not define, reference, or substantively examine the Industrial Operating Model, its mechanics, context, or theoretical foundation. Though it mentions 'traditional methods' as a source of resistance, there is no explanation or analysis of IOM assumptions, structures, historical roots, or where IOM succeeds. No explicit or substantive contrast with IOM is present; the content is fully about Kanban implementation, not the IOM as a model. The only slight alignment is the indirect reference to 'traditional methods' as a baseline for change, which is minimal and non-analytic.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about Kanban practices and team-level improvement, not the Industrial Operating Model itself. It does not explain, reference, or analyze IOM, so fit with the category is almost nonexistent.",
