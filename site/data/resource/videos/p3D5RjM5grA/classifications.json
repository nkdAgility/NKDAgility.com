The depth is decent, especially on leadership transformation, but focused more on practical and educational benefits than deep-dive strategic alignment or decision-making.

    "final_score": 14.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses on agile leadership and virtual training but makes no mention of autonomous AI agents, agentic principles, or agentic software delivery concepts. It addresses leadership, self-organisation, and technology use in virtual settings, but lacks any meaningful discussion of agentic AI, context-aware intelligence, agent design, or software delivery frameworks involving agency. The core themes (training, empowerment, virtual learning) are only tangentially related to modern software delivery topics and not specifically to agentic software delivery. Mentions, alignment, and depth are therefore very low, and intent is only weakly aligned due to the general 'improving software teams' motif.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content covers agile leadership training with no discussion of AI agents or agentic delivery. Its topic and intent are only very broadly related to the category, resulting in a poor fit.",
    "level": "Ignored"
