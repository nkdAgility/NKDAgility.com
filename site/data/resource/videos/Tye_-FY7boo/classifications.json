    "reasoning": "The content focuses on transitioning from traditional project management to product management using 'Vision, Value, and Validation'. While it discusses feedback loops and continuous validation, it never mentions or implies agentic principles: no AI, no agent integration, no proactive system intelligence. The audience (Product Owners) overlaps somewhat with those interested in Agentic Software Delivery, but there's no substantive discussion of AI agents, human-AI synergy, or contextual autonomy, which are central to the category. At best, the content presents generic practices that could be prerequisites to agentic approaches but lacks any direct or meaningful conceptual bridge.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is about product management principles for Product Owners, not Agentic Software Delivery. It lacks references to AI agents, context-aware systems, or agent integration. Fit is low and mostly incidental.",
    "level": "Ignored"
