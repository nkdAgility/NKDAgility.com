The discussion is moderately deep around value-driven teams and collaboration, which are adjacent to Lean, but the absence of direct Lean framing reduces confidence. The intent is to promote Agile best practices rather than Lean per se, and the primary audience—Agile practitioners—would overlap with those interested in Lean, but only partially.
