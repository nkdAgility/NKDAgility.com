However, it never explicitly discusses product operating models, nor does it cover organizational structures, decision-making frameworks, governance mechanisms, or resource allocation—core aspects detailed in the category definition. The audience is tangentially similar (agile professionals), and some concepts (empiricism, value streams, collaboration) overlap, but the content is primarily advisory for agile consultants/coaches, not a substantive or structured exploration of the product operating model at an organizational level.
