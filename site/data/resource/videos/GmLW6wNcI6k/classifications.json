    "reasoning": "The content focuses broadly on the assessment phase in consulting, emphasizing agile adaptation and continuous learning, but does not discuss AI, product operating models, or organizational approaches specific to AI product delivery. There are no direct or indirect references to AI, model lifecycle, data or model governance, or unique AI product considerations. The audience is more aligned with agile and Scrum practitioners, not those dealing with AI product operating models. The material is not outdated, nor does it contradict the framing, so no penalties are applied. The subject and examples remain entirely generic rather than contextualized for AI products or their operating model.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content does not address AI Product Operating Model topics; it is generic about consulting assessments and agile adaptation without any AI focus. Not a fit.",
    "level": "Ignored"
