    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on Scrum scaling, specifically addressing misconceptions about scaling Scrum and introducing the Nexus framework. There is no direct or indirect mention of Objective Key Results (OKRs), their principles, implementation, or impact. The underlying discussion is about framework scaling practices and value delivery at scale, not about structured goal-setting or measurable outcomes as defined in OKRs. While 'value delivery' and 'iteration' appear, they are contextually locked to Scrum and Nexus, not outcome-based measurement or OKR strategy. The content's target audience (Scrum practitioners and Agile coaches) overlaps slightly with OKR audiences, but this is incidental rather than deliberate. Overall, there is no substantive alignment with OKRs, and minimal conceptual overlap, resulting in a very low confidence score.",

No significant exploration of developer or system agency, autonomous decision-making, feedback-driven adaptation, or AI integration occurs.
