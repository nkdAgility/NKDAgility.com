There are no direct mentions of AI, human-AI collaboration, or the emergence of enhanced cognition through human-AI teams, which define the 'Collective Intelligence' category. While the content involves team collaboration and decision-making, these are strictly human-centered with no reference or alignment to AI, distributed cognition between humans and machines, or any hybrid intelligence scenarios.

Its main audience is Agile practitioners, partially aligning with the Agentic Engineering audience, but conceptual coverage is mild at best and mostly indirect. There are no signals of deliberate engineering practice design, decentralisation, or human/AI agency maximisation. No penalties apply since the tone and references are current and straightforward.",
