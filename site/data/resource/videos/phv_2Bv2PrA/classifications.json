The discussion delves beyond surface-level mentions, explaining how agile ensures usable product increments regularly and contrasts it to traditional release practices. The main intent fits: advocating for practices (including frequent releases) directly targeting agile/tech audiences. Signal-to-noise is high: nearly all discussions are relevant, focusing on release regularity, value realisation, and complexity mitigation.
