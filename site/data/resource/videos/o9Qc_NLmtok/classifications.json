The focus is on the structure, benefits, and experiential aspects of the course, rather than any Agile forecasting or metrics like SLE. The audience (Agile practitioners) could overlap with those interested in SLE, but in this instance, the topic is course structure and personal transformation, not SLE or related metrics. No penalties were applied since the content is not outdated or disparaging. The extremely low confidence score (3.5) reflects this absence of relevant SLE content, aside from nominal alignment in the audience. The signal score is slightly higher because the content is focused overall, even though it is off-topic for SLE.",

While it lightly refers to the 'philosophy of profound engagement,' it does not concretely discuss underlying convictions, foundational system beliefs, ethos as demonstrated in system behavior, or the deep drivers behind sustainable Agile transformation. The focus is on course logistics and learner experience—mainly discussing practices (blended learning, feedback loops) and benefits (transformation, real-world impact) at a surface level. There is little exploration of the core, demonstrable values or system-level ethos shaping Agile delivery. Audience and signal scores are relatively higher due to the relevance to Agile practitioners, but alignment, depth, and direct mentions are low, so the confidence is proportionally low for Ethos.",
