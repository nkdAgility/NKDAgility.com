It focuses on setup, best practices, and troubleshooting for migration processes, with no direct or implicit discussion of delivering customer value, feedback loops, or measuring impact on customer outcomes. The only potential link to value is that migrations could theoretically help teams serve customers better, but the content never addresses this. The intent, alignment, and depth scores are low as the material does not explore or reference Customer Focus topics, nor does it define customer value or discuss outcomes from a user’s point of view. Audience fit is higher, as some practitioners who care about customer value may use this, but the primary focus remains technical process, not customer-centricity.",
