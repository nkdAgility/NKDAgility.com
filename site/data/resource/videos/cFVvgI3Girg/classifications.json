    "reasoning": "There are no direct mentions of the Industrial Operating Model or its mechanisms, assumptions, or foundational theory. The content focuses on Agile leadership, organizational evolution, and system creation, which is fundamentally a shift away from IOM’s command-and-control, hierarchical, and efficiency-focused structures. While it references hierarchical roles and systemic leadership, these are used in the context of modern Agile approaches, which oppose IOM philosophy. There is no substantive analysis of IOM’s structures, functioning, or where it works best. The audience is somewhat aligned (organizational leaders), but the topic, depth, and direct relevance are minimal for this category.",
