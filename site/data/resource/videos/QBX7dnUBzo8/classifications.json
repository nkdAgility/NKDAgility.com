Metrics such as ROI and profit per team member are discussed, but not in connection with the OKR framework. The main audience (Agile coaches, leaders) and focus on outcome-based change partially overlap with the OKR context, but the content doesn't provide adequate coverage or practical guidance on OKRs.

However, it lacks explicit references to agency (human or AI), DevOps, ethical autonomy, or the integration of intelligent systems. Developer agency is implied in critiques of disengaged teams, but there's no substantial exploration of core Agentic Engineering themes like decentralized decision-making frameworks, DevOps-infused practices, or ethical AI collaboration.
