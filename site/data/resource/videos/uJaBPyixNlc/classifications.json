The primary audience is Agile trainers and coaches, with incidental overlap for product teams, not Product Developers specifically. The discussion lacks depth regarding the Product Developer role and mainly illustrates expectations for trainers who can work in complex product-related contexts rather than the unique behavioral, structural, or collective aspects defined under 'Product Developer.'

The primary purpose is to describe criteria and backgrounds for trainers, not to explore OKRs as a framework.

The discussion largely stays at the level of trainer selection and deep agile/Scrum practice, not the deliberate design of engineering environments for agency maximization (human/AI), nor does it address decentralized decision-making frameworks or DevOps-infused craft in the sense required by the classification definition. Although DevOps, experimentation, and empowerment are mentioned, these are secondary and not explored in sufficient depth to constitute a central, philosophical, or practical discussion of Agentic Engineering.
