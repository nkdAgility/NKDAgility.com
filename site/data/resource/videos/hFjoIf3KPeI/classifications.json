Its ideas are motivational and team-focused rather than process or workflow policy-focused.

The article does not name or directly discuss Product Developer accountability, nor does it address the skills, collective planning, integration with automation, or Scrum role overlap as required by the category.

The audience of Scrum Masters and Agile coaches somewhat overlaps with those who would use OKRs, but the core message does not address OKRs, their intent, practical implementation, or common anti-patterns. The content remains strictly about Scrum team motivation, so strong alignment to the OKR category is lacking in all substantial respects.",
