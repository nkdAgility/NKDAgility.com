It describes several practical strategies and behavioral tips but does not anchor recommendations in foundational, immutable principles or reference theorists or core constraints that are not context dependent. The audience and focus are appropriate for Agile/Scrum practitioners, but the alignment with first principles is superficial and indirect—conflict is framed as an issue to be managed, not as a violation or defense of non-negotiable constraints foundational to Agility or Scrum. There are no penalties as the content is current and not satirical or critical of first principles.
