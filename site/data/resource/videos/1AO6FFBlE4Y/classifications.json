    "reasoning": "The content centers on the impacts of poor code quality and practical steps for improvement—mainly through engineering excellence, technical debt reduction, and modern practices (CI, small tests). However, there is no explicit mention of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or the integration of AI with human expertise. While certain engineering practices (CI/CD, feedback loops) overlap somewhat with agentic prerequisites, the main themes are traditional code quality, productivity, and reputation. The target audience (engineers/leaders) is somewhat aligned. Depth scores are moderate due to thorough coverage of code quality but not agentic principles. Very little content could be construed as conceptually agentic; therefore, the fit is weak.",
