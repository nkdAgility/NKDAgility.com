There are no references to AI product lifecycle, data/model governance, or considerations specific to AI. The main themes and advice are generic to agile, leadership, and broader organizational evolution—not operationalizing or managing AI-centric products. The audience could overlap somewhat with AI operating model stakeholders (e.g., leaders, product owners), but the content intent and specifics do not address the unique requirements of AI product operations per the defined category scope.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about agile evolution and organizational change, not AI product operating models. No direct mention of AI or category themes. Does not fit the category except for broad organizational relevance.",
