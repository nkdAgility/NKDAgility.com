While it mentions value maximization and customer needs, these are embedded among broader themes of training, community, and support. Feedback loops, measuring impact using customer evidence, and continuous customer validation are not thoroughly addressed. Thus, while conceptually aligning with aspects of customer focus, especially in value delivery, the treatment is not deep or comprehensive.
