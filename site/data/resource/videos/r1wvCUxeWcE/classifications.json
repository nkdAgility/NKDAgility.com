These concepts align well with Product Delivery, as Kanban is a methodology used to improve delivery processes, make workflows visible, and identify bottlenecks. The intent—to improve team effectiveness and support continuous improvement—matches the Product Delivery category. While 'Product Delivery' is not explicitly mentioned, the themes are consistent with its definition (e.g., iterative improvement, workflow transparency), and the target audience (team practitioners, managers) is a fit. The discussion is practical, not theoretical, but it does not go deeply into integration with other delivery practices (e.g., deployment, QA) or broader team/organizational context. Therefore, there is some partial fit, high alignment, but also notable focus on visualization mechanics rather than end-to-end delivery processes.",
