Thus, it does not fit the category beyond extremely superficial connections (e.g., operating models in general). All dimensions scored at or very near the bottom, as only indirect, generic themes remotely (and barely) connect to the category. No penalties applied, as tone and timeframe are neutral and up-to-date.",
    "reasoning_summary": "No reference to AI or AI Product Operating Models; content is solely about generic Agile team alignment and does not fit the assigned category.",
