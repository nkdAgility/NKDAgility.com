While these are relevant to software creation, the main thrust is bridging UX and Scrum. Key ALM themes—such as governance, lifecycle stages, ALM-specific toolsets, and change/risk management throughout the app lifecycle—are not thoroughly discussed. The audience (Scrum/agile/product teams) is partially aligned with typical ALM practitioners, but the discussion is product execution-focused, not on full-lifecycle management or organizational governance. Minimal overlap exists conceptually (integration of UX as a practice that could be lifecycle-spanning), but the article does not discuss practices, tools, or KPIs typical of ALM frameworks. The argument for PSU’s popularity is rooted in team-level product improvement, not holistic application governance or lifecycle strategy, thus the confidence is low.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses the popularity and value of the PSU course, focusing on integrating user experience with Scrum in product development. While some themes like decision-making, cross-functional collaboration, and hypothesis-driven development could conceptually relate to aspects of Agentic Engineering (e.g., feedback-driven adaptation and agency in decision-making), the primary emphasis is on bridging UX and Scrum, not the deliberate maximisation of human or AI agency, ethical autonomy, or DevOps-infused craft as defined by Agentic Engineering. There are no direct mentions or explicit references to Agentic Engineering concepts, practices, or terms. The depth is moderate, focusing on practical improvements to Scrum teams rather than the philosophical framing or engineering practices of Agentic Engineering. The audience (Scrum practitioners and agile teams) is fairly well-aligned, but the signal is diluted somewhat by generic agile/Scrum promotion. No penalties apply since the content is recent, not contradictory, nor outdated.",

Terms such as 'operating model,' 'governance,' 'resource allocation,' or 'portfolio management' are not mentioned, and the primary audience appears to be practitioners improving team delivery, not strategists or executives shaping the organization-wide product operating model.
