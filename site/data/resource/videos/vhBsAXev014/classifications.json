    "reasoning": "The content exclusively discusses challenges and strategies within agile transformations, focusing on vision, communication, alignment, and principles for navigating chaos. There are no explicit or implicit references to AI, machine learning, or the operationalization of AI products, nor do any aspects address the unique governance, lifecycle management, or specific organizational practices relevant to AI Product Operating Models. The primary audience is agile practitioners, and discussions center on general agile operating models and transformation strategy, not on AI-powered products or their management.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about general agile transformation, not AI. It lacks any reference to AI products, their lifecycles, governance, or AI-specific operating model concerns—so it does not fit the AI Product Operating Model category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
