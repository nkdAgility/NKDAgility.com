    "reasoning": "The content focuses on recommending the Agile Practitioner Series (APS) course for new Scrum teams, with recurring mentions of organizational change, empowerment, and realignment. While it lightly touches on operational structures (e.g., need to adjust operational structures, organizational change backlog, team/leadership engagement), these are framed in the context of training benefits—mainly implementing Scrum, team empowerment, and cultural adaptation—rather than a thorough exploration of organizational design, governance mechanisms, or end-to-end product delivery frameworks. There is no explicit discussion of product operating models, structural governance, resource allocation, or the integration of business strategy with product delivery at an organizational level. The core intent is to promote the value of APS for team-level transformation, not the design or assessment of a product operating model. The audience is somewhat aligned, targeting practitioners, leaders, and organizations beginning agile journeys, but the discussion is mostly tactical and introductory rather than strategic or architectural. Signal is moderate, with some scattered references to relevant themes, but the overall focus is on course benefits and personal recommendations. There are no outdated practices or contradictions to warrant penalties.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is about course benefits for scrum teams, with only brief references to organizational change or structure. It lacks depth or direct discussion of product operating models, so fit with the category is partial and mostly tangential.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of 'operating model' are absent, but there are moderate indirect signals—e.g., focus on organizational change, operational structures, and empowerment. However, most content revolves around recommending a Scrum course and team-level benefits. Deeper analysis of value streams, governance, cross-functional structuring, and operating model alignment with business strategy is lacking. The discussion of an 'Organizational Change Backlog' does touch on modifying how a team or org operates, yet it remains mostly pedagogical and focused on training outcomes rather than organization-wide operating model transformation. Audience includes leaders and team members but not primarily executives responsible for enterprise operating models. Content is relevant and detailed in places but does not meet the threshold for in-depth operating model evaluation.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on a Scrum training course for new teams, touching on organizational change but not sufficiently addressing operating model design or evaluation. Fit with 'Operating Model' is partial and indirect.",

All topics relate to organizational change and Scrum adoption, which, although structurally adjacent to product operating models, are traditional Agile/organizational change concepts. No AI-specific lifecycle, data/model governance, MLOps, or ethical AI topics appear. The intent, examples, and audience are Scrum and Agile practitioners, not those working on AI products or operating models.",
