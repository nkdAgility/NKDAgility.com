There is a very weak thematic alignment on the intent to continuously improve and to empower teams, but this is not unique or specific to SLE. Thus, direct mentions and conceptual alignment are near minimum, with only peripheral audience overlap (practitioners considering agile improvement, possibly the same group interested in SLE). The signal-to-noise ratio is low for the SLE category — nearly 100% of the content is dedicated to other agile/consulting themes.
