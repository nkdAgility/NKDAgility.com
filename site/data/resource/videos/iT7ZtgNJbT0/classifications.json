While Scrum (which is founded on empirical process control) is central to the story, the narrative does not directly reference, explain, or substantially explore empirical process control's principles like transparency, inspection, or adaptation. Instead, it focuses on the general impact of Agile/Scrum coaching. There are implicit hints at empirical outcomes (long-term transformation, ongoing client success), but there is minimal discussion about evidence-based decision-making or the specific mechanisms of empirical process control. The audience is relevant (Agile practitioners, consultants), and the majority of content stays within the Agile/Scrum domain, yet the theme is anecdotal/celebratory rather than instructive on empirical principles. Penalties applied mostly for lack of explicit reference and limited substantive depth on the category definition.",
