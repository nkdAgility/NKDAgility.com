    "reasoning": "The content does not directly mention Agentic Engineering or related core concepts such as developer agency, system observability, DevOps practices, or ethical AI integration. Its main focus is on the limitations of traditional project management in complex environments and a brief endorsement of Agile and Scrum as superior alternatives. There is no substantive discussion on decentralised decision-making, continuous value delivery, or engineering autonomy. The only slight alignment is the broad advocacy for adaptability (Agile) in complex work, yet without linking it to the philosophy or systemic practice described by Agentic Engineering. The intended readers—Agile practitioners and consultants—overlap somewhat with the Agentic Engineering audience, but the content’s scope is narrower and misses the distinctiveness of the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content discusses why traditional project management fails in complexity and briefly suggests Agile as an alternative, but it does not directly address or explore Agentic Engineering concepts like developer agency or system-driven autonomy. The relevance to the category is minimal.",

    "reasoning": "The content analyzes the limitations of traditional project management in complex environments and suggests Agile as an alternative. However, it does not mention or discuss agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or modern agent-oriented practices. There is no coverage of AI integration, agency, human-agent collaboration, or feedback loops involving agentic systems. The target audience (agile consultants, teams in complex domains) aligns to those interested in related innovations, but the topic itself is off the Agentic Software Delivery category. The discussion is entirely pre-agentic, focusing narrowly on the project management/Agile dichotomy rather than advances involving software delivery agents.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content only discusses why traditional project management falters in complex environments and recommends Agile. It does not mention, reference, or align with Agentic Software Delivery or its key themes, so fit is negligible.",
