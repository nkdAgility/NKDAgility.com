    "reasoning": "The content exclusively focuses on the Sprint Review workshop in Agile, emphasizing stakeholder engagement, market alignment, and continuous improvement. There is no explicit or implicit mention of OKRs, Objectives, Key Results, or outcome-based alignment as defined by John Doerr. The main ideas, terminology, and examples center strictly around Agile practices and ceremonies. No evidence is shown of applying, discussing, or intersecting with the OKR framework—neither its theory nor operational specifics. Any alignment with OKR principles is distant and coincidental (such as references to improvement and alignment), but not in the context of OKRs as a goal-setting or measurement system. The only alignment is very faint, arising from a shared emphasis on reflection and improvement common to Agile and OKR philosophies, but not grounded in OKR theory.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content solely addresses the Agile Sprint Review workshop without referencing objectives, key results, or the OKR framework. It does not discuss OKR theory, practices, or strategic alignment, and only shares surface similarities about improvement and stakeholder engagement.",

    "reasoning": "Direct references to 'Agentic Engineering' are absent. The content focuses on the Sprint Review's role in stakeholder engagement, market alignment, and continuous improvement—these themes lightly touch on decentralised feedback and potentially developer agency. However, there is no explicit discussion of agency (human/AI), engineering for autonomy, or systemic observability. Emphasis is on Agile practice and collaboration, not on the deliberate engineering of agency or integration of AI. The audience fits practitioners, moderately matching the category. Signal is fair but not tightly tied to the philosophical or ethical aspects of agentic practices—rather, it centres on practical workshop guidance.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content addresses Agile Sprint Reviews and stakeholder engagement, indirectly touching on themes of team autonomy and feedback but lacking explicit focus on agentic engineering principles. Its alignment is partial and mainly practical, not philosophical or technical regarding agency.",

However, it does not mention or discuss autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery concepts. There is no reference to integration of AI, agent-driven workflows, or modern agentic engineering practices. The audience (Agile/DevOps professionals) aligns, and relevance is high for Agile practice, but not for the specific topic of Agentic Software Delivery. Consequently, scores for mentions, alignment, depth, and intent are low, reflecting only tangential overlap with agentic principles.",
