While these are adjacent to principles like decentralized decision-making and feedback loops found in Agentic Engineering, there are no explicit references to engineering practices, agency maximization, ethical AI, observability, or DevOps-craft as defined by the classification. Autonomy is referenced in the sense of openness to feedback, but not in the agentic, systemic, or infrastructural sense. The discussion is at the team culture and interpersonal level, not the deliberate design of engineering systems to maximize agency for humans or intelligent systems. Some points overlap (like data-driven adaptation), but overall, the fit is loose and largely incidental.",
