While there is no explicit use of the term 'sociotechnical systems,' the conceptual alignment is strong, as the author explores how organizational practices, learning, and culture shape technical outcomes. The depth is notable, with real-world examples showing the failure modes of ignoring social systems when adopting technical change. The audience is IT leaders, engineers, consultants, and organizations dealing with DevOps transformations, matching the category.

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the pitfalls of DevOps outsourcing and advocates for partnership-led transformation and modern engineering practices. There is no direct or substantive discussion of the Industrial Operating Model—no explicit mention of hierarchical structures, scientific management, or IOM's efficiency-focused assumptions/mechanics. Occasional references to legacy technology and outdated practices may imply older organizational models, but these are not discussed in the context of IOM as defined. The intent is to encourage modern, team-empowered engineering strategies, not to explain or defend the IOM model; as such, alignment, depth, and mention scores are very low. There is no strong audience alignment, as the target is practitioners seeking to modernize rather than those interested in understanding IOM. Overall, the match is very weak, fitting the exclusion criteria.",
