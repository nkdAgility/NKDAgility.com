    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the value of running a Professional Scrum workshop for practical skills, team unity, and hands-on learning. It describes experiential learning, problem-solving, and organizational growth, occasionally touching on purpose and collective vision. However, it mostly addresses practices and benefits, not deep system-level convictions or evidence of foundational ethos. Discussions about beliefs, underlying convictions, or how ethos underpins sustainable agility are either implied or surface-level. The main goal is to advocate for attending workshops, with only brief hints at the impact of shared values. Audience alignment is strong, targeting professionals involved in Agile/Scrum. While references to 'value', 'behavior', and 'philosophy' are present, there is little direct engagement with 'ethos' as defined. Thus, the content has low conceptual alignment and depth for this category, with fair focus and solid audience targeting.",
