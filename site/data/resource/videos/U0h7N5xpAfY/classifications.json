    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on the traditional role and practices of a Scrum Master—maximising team effectiveness, teaching empiricism, resolving organizational impediments—as defined by the Scrum framework. There is no mention or discussion of agentic principles, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or any related concepts from the Agentic Software Delivery category. Therefore, alignment, depth, and intent are all minimal. The intended audience (Scrum Masters, agile practitioners) overlaps marginally with the target audience for agentic delivery, but the topical focus remains on conventional Scrum roles—not on integrating AI agents or agency into software delivery. Signal-to-noise is moderate, as everything is Scrum-relevant but off-topic for agentic software delivery. There are no penalties for outdated or undermining content decisions, but there's no substantive fit either.",

Most discussion remains focused on Scrum team dynamics and the Scrum Master’s personal development, with only occasional references to wider organizational impact.
