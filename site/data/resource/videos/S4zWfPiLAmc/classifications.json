There is no mention of AI, AI products, operating models, data/model governance, or any AI-specific challenges outlined in the category definition. Alignment, depth, and audience scores are slightly above zero to reflect a general process improvement focus, but there are no references to AI, product operating models, or organizational structuring for AI, which makes this a poor fit for the AI Product Operating Model category.",
