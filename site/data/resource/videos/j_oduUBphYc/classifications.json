    "reasoning": "The content focuses on secure modernisation of legacy systems with an emphasis on embedding security practices within the engineering lifecycle. While it discusses team empowerment (developer agency) and continuous, feedback-driven security practices, there is little explicit reference to maximising both human and AI agency, ethical AI collaboration, or systemic observability. The intent and audience align moderately with Agentic Engineering, as it targets technical practitioners and advises on decentralised, empowered decision-making. However, the article is more about security culture and modernisation process than the deliberate design of agency-maximising systems or philosophical underpinnings central to Agentic Engineering. No outdated practices or contradictory tone were found.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content moderately aligns with Agentic Engineering due to its focus on team empowerment, continuous improvement, and embedding secure, participatory practices. However, it lacks explicit discussion of human-AI agency maximisation or deep system-level design, so its fit with the category is partial rather than strong.",

    "reasoning": "The content addresses modernising legacy systems with a focus on security, team empowerment, and system-of-work analysis, which aligns in part with modern engineering practices—but it never discusses autonomous AI agents, agentic patterns, or advanced contextual intelligence. Key agentic themes such as integrating AI with human expertise, governance of agents, or the evolution toward outcome-focused agentic systems are entirely absent. The piece is targeted at technical, security, and organisational leaders rather than specifically practitioners in agentic delivery. Its main themes are tangential—not directly aligned with Agentic Software Delivery. No explicit mentions or discussions on AI agency, agent integration, or related topics occur.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on legacy system security and safe modernisation, not autonomous AI agents or agentic principles. It only partially overlaps via modern practices, lacking core agentic discussion; thus, fit with the category is weak and incidental.",
