There is some overlap in discussing making processes explicit, mapping workflows, and iteratively improving flow, but there are no direct or explicit references to the 'Definition of Workflow' as understood in Kanban/agile contexts. Exit criteria, WIP limits, and distinction from Definition of Done are not addressed. The alignment and depth are moderate due to general process mapping and improvement themes, but the lack of direct mentions and specific policy focus confines the confidence.",
