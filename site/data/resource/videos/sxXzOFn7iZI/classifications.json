    "reasoning": "The content focuses on hiring Agile coaches, their skills, and their impact on team and organizational Agile transformation. There are no direct or indirect references to the Industrial Operating Model or its characteristics (hierarchy, Taylorism, functional silos, etc.), nor any analysis or explanation of IOM's assumptions, mechanics, or where it works. The only tangential connection is the implication that some organizations are undergoing Agile transformation (potentially from a traditional model), but this is not explored; there is no explanation or discussion of the IOM itself. Therefore, the content has almost no fit with the category, scoring minimally on direct mentions, conceptual alignment, depth, and intent, with slightly higher audience and signal scores as the audience (organizational leaders) might overlap. No penalties were applied as the content is neither outdated nor antagonistic.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about hiring and qualities of Agile coaches, not about the Industrial Operating Model. It does not explain, analyze, or describe the IOM itself. Fit with the category is minimal.",
