    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses Evidence-Based Management (EBM) for product owners, emphasizing data-driven decision-making, value delivery, team engagement, and stakeholder alignment. While concepts like developer engagement and decision-making are adjacent to agentic engineering, the post does not reference agentic engineering explicitly or address core topics such as maximizing agency for both humans and AI, ethical autonomy, or DevOps-infused craft. The depth remains focused on EBM practices without delving into the philosophical or technical underpinnings of agency. Audience and signal-to-noise are moderately high as the piece consistently targets product owners in a modern Agile context but with an EBM-centric, not agency-centric, approach.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is centered on EBM for product owners, with emphasis on value metrics and team engagement. While there are some adjacent ideas on empowerment and informed decision-making, it doesn’t explore or reference agentic engineering concepts directly or in depth, resulting in limited category alignment.",

    "reasoning": "The content centers on Evidence-Based Management for product owners, focusing strictly on value metrics, decision making, and team engagement. There are zero explicit or implicit references to agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or related architectural/engineering practices. The closest overlap is indirect—discussing metrics, value delivery, and collaboration in agile teams—none of which invoke or explore the concept of agency, AI integration, or context-aware intelligence in systems of work. Thus, alignment, depth, and intent are all very weak fits for the category, and mentions are nearly absent. The content targets a technical/practitioner audience, which is somewhat shared with agentic delivery topics, but otherwise does not fit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about Evidence-Based Management and value metrics for product owners, with no discussion of AI agents, agency, or agentic software delivery concepts. Fit with the category is extremely low and almost entirely absent.",
