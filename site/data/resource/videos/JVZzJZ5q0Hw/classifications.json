    "reasoning": "The content centers on the purpose and tactical value of sprint goals in Scrum, discussing how they connect team efforts to broader product goals and visions. However, it stops short of explicitly discussing 'Customer Focus' as defined—there is little to no mention of customer outcomes, measuring value from the user's perspective, or using feedback from real end users. Although actionable feedback from stakeholders and the connection between daily work and vision are covered, the feedback is framed in terms of internal evaluation and team clarity rather than direct customer benefit. The audience is practitioners interested in agile/Scrum, matching the category, and the discussion is focused with minimal tangents. Due to the lack of explicit customer-centric measurement or value validation, conceptual alignment and depth remain moderate, and scores reflect that. No penalties are necessary.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the piece thoroughly explains sprint goals' tactical importance in Scrum, it doesn't directly address how they deliver or measure value for customers. The emphasis is on team alignment and tangible feedback, not on customer outcomes, keeping its fit for the Customer Focus category moderate.",
