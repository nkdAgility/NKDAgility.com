There are zero direct mentions of hypothesis-driven development, hypotheses, experimentation, or empirical validation. The primary themes advocate for value delivery, human judgement, and continuous improvement in complex systems. While it encourages challenging the status quo and adapting, it stops short of proposing hypothesis formulation, experiments, or validated learning as mechanisms. No methods like A/B testing, experiment design, nor links to Lean Startup or hypothesis-driven frameworks are discussed. The intended audience is Agile practitioners, consistent with the category, but topical fit is weak, as it lacks any discussion of hypotheses or experimentation.
