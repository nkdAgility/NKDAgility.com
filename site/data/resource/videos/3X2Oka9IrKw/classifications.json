There is meaningful depth in discussing structure, roles, and process impacts on teams, as well as actionable advice drawn from practice. The audience fits practitioners and leaders seeking practical guidance for improving how teams function at scale, resonating with the category's focus. Some emphasis is also placed on broader organizational structures or cultural mindsets, which shifts focus partially away from team-only performance, leading to slightly lower directness and signal-to-noise.
