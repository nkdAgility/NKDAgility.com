It covers the value of inspection, learning from feedback, and adaptation, though it does not directly or frequently use the phrase 'empirical process control.' Instead, the concepts are strongly aligned: transparency (openness to feedback), inspection (reflection on past decisions), and adaptation (changing course in response to new information) are frequent themes. The audience is practitioners in Agile roles, matching the category. The discussion is practical and focused, with minor broad phrasing about mindsets but no significant noise. Lack of explicit references to empirical process control by name limits the 'Direct Mentions' score, but thematic fit is robust. No penalties were applied since the content is current, accurate, and does not contradict the category framing.",
