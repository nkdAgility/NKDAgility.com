It touches lightly on themes like engineering excellence and feedback loops, aligning partially with Agentic Engineering’s focus on system improvement and developer empowerment. However, it does not discuss maximisation of human or AI agency, ethical AI, decentralised decision-making, or the philosophical foundation of agentic practices. While some core elements like fast feedback and autonomy are indirectly referenced, the discussion remains tool- and consulting-centric, not deeply exploring the unique tenets of Agentic Engineering.",
