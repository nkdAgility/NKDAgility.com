However, it does not substantively discuss or analyze organizational operating model design, structure, governance, or transformation. Kanban is discussed in the context of team practices, not as an enabler or exemplar of organization-wide operating model change. There are no explicit mentions of 'operating model', nor treatment of topics like organizational structure, cross-team integration, or alignment with strategic objectives. The depth of process discussion exceeds mere superficiality, but falls short of the broader operating model discourse outlined in the definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on applying Kanban for team workflow efficiency, lacking substantive discussion of operating model structure, transformation, or organizational design. It does not fit the 'Operating Model' category beyond incidental process improvement.",
