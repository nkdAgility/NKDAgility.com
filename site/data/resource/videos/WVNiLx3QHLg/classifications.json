However, it never explicitly references 'first principles,' nor does it engage in identifying or explaining foundational, immutable truths underpinning Lean, Agile, or DevOps. The discussion is aspirational and practical, centering on values and preferred structures (competence over authority) rather than on non-negotiable constraints or first principles. Mention of #Agile and Scrum audience tags raises relevance for practitioners, but the lack of direct treatment of first principles means alignment and depth remain low.",
