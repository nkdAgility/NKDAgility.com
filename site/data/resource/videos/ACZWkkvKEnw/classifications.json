The article is aimed at agile practitioners and leaders, consistent with the Agentic Engineering audience, with a clear focus and minimal tangential content. Its depth is moderate; it explains concepts well but lacks explicit reference to maximizing human or AI agency, ethical autonomy, or DevOps-infused practices. Given the intent to drive better organisational alignment and holistic decision-making, the fit is partial but not strong.",
