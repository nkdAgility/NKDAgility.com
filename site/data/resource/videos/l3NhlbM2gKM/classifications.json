    "reasoning": "The content discusses Scrum and story points within Agile teams. There is no substantive examination of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM)—its assumptions, structure, or operation. Hierarchy, stage gates, or centralized decision-making are not addressed. No IOM terms or concepts are directly mentioned, nor is there comparison to the IOM paradigm. Audience and purpose are closely aligned with Agile practitioners, not those seeking understanding of IOM. Minimal tangential alignment is possible as story points are contrasted with traditional estimation, but the focus remains Agile-centric. There is no depth, direct mention, or detailed relevance to IOM. No penalties were needed since there's no outdatedness or satirical tone detected.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses entirely on Agile estimation and Scrum team practices. It does not discuss or explain the Industrial Operating Model or its mechanics, so alignment with the category is negligible.",
    "level": "Ignored"
