    "reasoning": "The content centers on styles of Agile leadership (dictatorship vs. democracy) and the importance of balancing direction with collaboration. There are no direct mentions or substantial exploration of agentic software delivery, AI agents, or intelligent automation. The discussion is limited to human leadership models and team dynamics, without connecting to agentic principles, AI, or the integration of intelligent agents into delivery processes. Audience partially overlaps (Agile practitioners), but the content remains unrelated to agentic software delivery's core concepts.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Discusses leadership models in Agile, not agentic delivery. Lacks references to AI agents, contextual intelligence, or system integration. Only tangentially relevant via audience. Does not fit the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
