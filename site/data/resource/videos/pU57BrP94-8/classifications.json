    "reasoning": "The content focuses on immersive learning in Agile contexts, emphasizing practical application, feedback loops, and collaborative learning. While it hints at developer agency and feedback-driven adaptation, it does not discuss the deliberate design of engineering practices, decision decentralization, or human/AI agency at the system or cultural level, which are central to Agentic Engineering. No explicit mention of core concepts like DevOps, automation, or ethical AI, and the narrative is educational rather than engineering-practice oriented.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on immersive learning and coaching in Agile contexts. There is no explicit reference to autonomous AI agents, agentic principles, or the integration of contextual intelligence into delivery. The themes are centered on human-centric experiential learning, feedback, collaboration, and skill-building within organizational contexts. While it touches on learning loops and organizational tailoring, this does not equate to the embedding of AI agents or agentic delivery models. There are no agent governance frameworks, human-in-the-loop designs involving software agents, or discussion of autonomous AI in software delivery. The target audience is Agile practitioners interested in learning and coaching, not those seeking insight into agentic software delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about immersive, human-led Agile coaching and learning, not agentic software delivery or integration of AI agents. No mention or alignment with agentic concepts—fit with the category is negligible and purely incidental.",
