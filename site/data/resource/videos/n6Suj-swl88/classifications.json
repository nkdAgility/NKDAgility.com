The alignment is weak, since product backlog refinement, stakeholder communication, and meeting facilitation are organizational/process management topics, not engineering methodology. The main audience may overlap slightly with practitioners of engineering practices (e.g., Scrum teams), but the technical depth is absent; the discussion never extends into how code is written, tested, deployed, nor any of the technical craftsmanship principles.
