    "reasoning": "The content centers on establishing and maintaining a working agreement within Kanban teams. While it touches on team alignment (part of operating model components), it never explicitly discusses the concept of a product operating model or delves into organization-wide structures, governance, or cross-functional collaboration. The article is tactical and focused at the team/process level, without addressing frameworks for product delivery, resource allocation, portfolio management, or broader organizational design. There are only indirect mentions of broader organizational fit, with the entire piece contained to practices internal to a single Kanban team. Thus, while partly aligned on intent and audience, the content does not substantively fit the 'Product Operating Model' category as defined.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Discusses Kanban working agreements—team-level process, not product operating models. Only partial conceptual overlap; lacks structural, governance, or organization-wide focus needed for this category.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mention of 'operating model' is absent; the discussion is about creating team-level working agreements and alignment within Kanban (and broadly, Agile teams). Content focuses on defining roles, goals, processes, and workflows but strictly at the team/process level, not at the wider organizational structure or operating model topic. No exploration of operating model transformation, alignment with organizational strategy, or references to organizational design theories. Audience is practitioners/team leads rather than executive or organizational strategists. Content is very focused on relevant team processes, so signal-to-noise is high, but the fit for Operating Model is only tangential at best.",
