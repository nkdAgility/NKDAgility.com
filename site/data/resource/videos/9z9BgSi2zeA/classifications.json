    "reasoning": "The content exclusively focuses on selecting Agile coaches for technical and leadership engagement in software and general business contexts. There are no mentions, references, or inferred structure related to AI Product Operating Models, nor any AI-specific challenges or operationalization topics. While the piece discusses transformation, value streams, and roles, these are framed within general Agile practices. No AI governance, model lifecycle, or responsible AI practices are discussed; thus, conceptual and thematic alignment is negligible.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the qualities needed in an Agile coach, specifically engagement with technical teams and leadership to facilitate Agile transformation. It does not directly mention the Industrial Operating Model, its structures, or operate within its framing. There is implicit reference that organizations may be shifting from traditional modes to Agile, but the mechanics, assumptions, or strengths of IOM are neither the topic nor explained. No explicit comparisons, definitions, or analysis of IOM are present. Only tangential references exist (e.g., leadership, transformation), lacking substantive coverage per classification requirements.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about hiring Agile coaches for organizational transformation and leadership/technical engagement. It does not discuss the Industrial Operating Model or its principles, making fit extremely low and only tangential at best.",
