The intent fits tangentially as the article guides better work practices through flexible decision-making, but the main aim is Agile effectiveness over theoretical decision analysis.

However, the core discussion aligns closely with key dimensions: adaptability, collective empiricism, team collaboration, value flow, and overcoming rigid structures—central to the category. The piece advocates abandoning fixed, plan-driven metrics (burndown charts) in favor of just-in-time planning, empirical management, adaptability, and value-centric delivery—hallmarks of Social Technologies. It critiques traditional tools undermining self-organisation, promotes continuous improvement, and targets Agile practitioners and coaches. Discussion explores not only what’s wrong but proposes category-aligned alternatives (flow, empiricism, coaching), offering substantiated depth for Agile/DevOps contexts. No penalties: the piece is contemporary, not satirical, and critiquing tools aligns with the intent of continuous improvement.",
