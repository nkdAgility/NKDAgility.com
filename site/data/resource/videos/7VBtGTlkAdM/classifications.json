The main idea is to align consulting engagements with customer results, mentioning 'outcome,' 'value,' and adaptability to client needs. While it references these concepts explicitly and aligns them with agile principles, it does not deeply explore how value is measured, feedback from actual users, or detailed mechanisms for customer validation, which limits the depth.
