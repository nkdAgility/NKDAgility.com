It critiques superficial approaches (DevOps as buzzword, learning as afterthought) and warns of the risks of absent ethos. The discussion aligns conceptually and practically with Ethos, targeting teams, leaders, and coaches involved in agility/transformation. Concrete examples are used to show how ethos is evidenced, though the discussion—while thorough—remains high-level without in-depth case analysis. Audience and signal scores are strong given direct targeting of agile/engineering leaders. No outdated ideas or penalties required.",
