While it references teamwork, feedback, and collaboration, it does so strictly in the context of human teams—not in partnership with AI. There are no discussions of human-AI collaboration, distributed cognition involving AI, or collective intelligence as defined. No AI agents, collective problem-solving with AI, or complementary human-AI strengths are mentioned. The core intent is aligned with promoting authentic human agility, not the emergence of new capabilities from human-AI partnerships. The audience (software practitioners and leaders) somewhat overlaps with the category's typical audience, and the content is focused, but it remains outside the scope of collective intelligence as defined here.",

While it discusses themes like autonomy, feedback loops, and empowerment, it doesn't explicitly use the language or frameworks unique to Agentic Engineering. It remains anchored in agile/scrum cultural critique and improvement, without exploring engineering design for maximising agency (human or AI), systemic observability, or ethical autonomy. So, some core Agentic Engineering concepts are touched (empowerment, retrospectives, responsiveness), but mostly in service of authentic agile—not as an integrated engineering philosophy. The intended audience (agile practitioners, trainers) does overlap, and much content is relevant, but direct conceptual exploration and technical depth for Agentic Engineering are limited.",

No mention is made of AI-driven agency, agentic system design, or agent-enabled delivery models. The closest parallel is some attention to feedback loops and seamless deployment, but these are presented in a traditional agile sense, not through the lens of agentic delivery.

However, the primary intent is not an in-depth, descriptive, or supportive exploration of the IOM itself, but rather a discussion about the limitations of traditional practices as barriers to agility.
