    "reasoning": "The content is focused on tech leadership burnout, resilience, and building future-ready teams; it does not explicitly mention the Industrial Operating Model, its premises, or organizational mechanics. While there are vague allusions to process and decision-making bottlenecks, the discussion is generic leadership advice and does not cover hierarchy, scientific management, or any IOM-specific principles. There's no exploration of where IOM works effectively or how it functions, nor is there any comparison to adaptive models. The intended audience (CTOs, tech leaders) could overlap with those interested in operating models, but the actual material lacks any substantial IOM alignment.",
