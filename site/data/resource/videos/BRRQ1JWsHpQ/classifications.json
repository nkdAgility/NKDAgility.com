    "reasoning": "The content focuses on practical agile training, group facilitation, and applying learning in the workplace. While it touches on themes like experimentation and context and briefly mentions DevOps, there is no discussion or explicit mention of agentic software delivery, AI agents, or autonomous systems. There is no technical or conceptual alignment with the key topics of Agentic Software Delivery. The primary audience (agile practitioners, facilitators, and scrum masters) slightly overlaps, but the subject matter is general agile enablement, not about embedding AI agents or agentic frameworks. Almost all content is dedicated to traditional human-centric training and collaboration tools, and not to the integration of AI agency, intelligence, or agent-support in software delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on agile training, facilitation, and practical engagement; it does not address agentic software delivery, AI agents, or contextual intelligence. Alignment with the category is minimal and mostly coincidental.",
