While the themes of transparency, feedback, and experimentation are relevant to how work is done, their framing is limited to Agile practices rather than organization-wide operating models. The depth is fully focused on empiricism within work practices rather than broader operating model contexts. The intended audience appears to be Agile practitioners, not those focused on structural or governance issues. There is minimal noise, but the content is off-scope for this category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Primarily focused on empiricism in Agile and team-level improvement, not organizational operating models. No substantive link to operating model design, structure, or transformation, so category fit is weak and partial.",
