These are important Agile working practices but are framed at the team/process level and do not discuss or mention product operating models, organizational structures, governance, or mechanisms that align product strategy with execution. There is no explicit or implicit reference to product operating models, nor sufficient thematic connection to structures, governance, cross-functional collaboration, or organizational design. The content addresses Agile practitioners or teams, fitting the audience dimension, but it lacks the breadth and depth necessary for this category. It also does not connect these practices to organization-wide ways of working as described in Product Operating Model frameworks.",
