    "ai_penalty_details": "none",
    "final_score": 20.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on evidence-based metrics (PAL-EBM) for leadership and organisational effectiveness, without mentioning agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or synergies between AI and human expertise. There are no explicit or implicit references to context-aware intelligence, agentic integration, governance frameworks for agents, or any engineering practices unique to agentic delivery. The audience—organizational leaders and Scrum practitioners—somewhat overlaps, but the main topics are leadership, measurement, and empirical management, not agentic systems. Discussion depth remains within metric effectiveness and cultural change, not technical or agentic. Overall, fit is minimal and largely tangential.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about leadership and evidence-based metrics; it does not discuss agentic software delivery, AI agency, or the required integration with software engineering, so fit is poor and at best tangential.",
    "level": "Ignored"
