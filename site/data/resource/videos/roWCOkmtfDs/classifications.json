However, there is conceptual overlap in advocating telemetry, feedback loops, and empowering product managers, which aligns loosely with system observability and decision-making practices. The main thrust targets product managers and owners on hypothesis-driven product validation—related to empirical feedback and adaptive change but not oriented to maximising human/AI agency or autonomy at the engineering practice level. The discussion falls short of addressing autonomy, decentralised decision-making frameworks, or AI integration, placing the content on the periphery of the category.",
