There is some thematic overlap regarding cross-functional alignment and purpose, but it lacks substantive exploration of Product Developer behaviors, responsibilities, or structure. No references are made to sprint goals, collective accountability, or quality practices as required by the category. As such, alignment and depth remain limited, though audience and focus are somewhat relevant due to the Scrum/Agile context. No penalties applied as there are no outdated or contradictory stances.",

There's no discussion of AI agency, collaboration patterns, distributed cognition involving AI, or socio-technical factors linking human-AI relationships. All examples reference human collaboration.

The intended audience is aligned in that it may include technical leaders, but the topic is not targeted toward engineering practitioners interested in Agentic Engineering’s philosophical or methodological concerns.
