While there are underlying hints at foundational beliefs (e.g., importance of vision, shared understanding), explicit discussion of ethos as foundational system-level belief is limited. It does not mention or deeply explore ethos or its implications for system behavior, leadership, or sustained transformation—key to this category. There is moderate conceptual overlap via references to alignment and purpose, but these are more illustrative of good practice than a discourse on ethos per se. The purpose is practical, not a reflection on ethos as a sustaining systemic value, and depth is primarily in actionable advice rather than systemic convictions. Audience mostly aligns, as Product Owners are likely to be interested in ethos, but overt focus is not clear. Minimal off-topic content.",
