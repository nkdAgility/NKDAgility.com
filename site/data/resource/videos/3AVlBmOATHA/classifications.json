There are discussions of agile principles (iteration, frequent value delivery, metrics, and stakeholder collaboration), but none about the Definition of Workflow as per Kanban or agile contexts. Key elements like entry/exit policies, WIP limits, explicit documented workflow agreements, or distinctions with Definition of Done are absent. Workflow is only mentioned in passing, never explicitly as a definitional model or governance construct. There's minor topical overlap with making work visible and focusing on valuable work, but these are not tied specifically to the Definition of Workflow. The main audience match comes from addressing teams and leadership in agile adoption, not workflow specifics. Therefore, scores for mentions, alignment, depth, and intent are very low, with slightly higher (but still low) signal and audience scores due to focus on agile practitioners.",
