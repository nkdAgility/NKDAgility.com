The focus is instead on Agile training, continuous forecasting, virtual class logistics, and general metric usage (e.g., throughput, cycle time, Monte Carlo simulations). While Daniel Vacanti, a known authority on SLE, is referenced in context of continuous forecasting, the content does not actually cover the SLE concept, its calculation, application, or improvement. Further, the metrics and forecasting practices mentioned are commonly used in Agile but are not directly tied to SLE here, and there is no discussion of SLE's defining attributes (elapsed time range, probability, etc.) or its purpose/role in improving predictability or managing stakeholder expectations. For these reasons, direct mentions and conceptual alignment scores are low, as are depth and intent, since SLE is not the main focus and only tangentially approached. However, the audience (Agile practitioners) is loosely aligned, and the content is reasonably well-focused on metrics (signal), but all SLE cues are indirect or absent. No outdated information or penalties were identified.",
