Its alignment and depth scores are minimal, as the main theme is psychological safety and comprehension—not workflow definition or process transparency. Audience is partly relevant since it targets product owners in agile contexts, but not tied to workflow. No signals of outdated or critical tone, so no penalties applied.",

The content does not discuss collective responsibility, skills, or practices specific to Product Developers; instead, it emphasizes PO behaviors.

The alignment is minimal, as the content emphasizes psychological safety and communication—foundational for agency, but does not discuss the deliberate design of engineering practices to maximize agency for humans or intelligent systems.
