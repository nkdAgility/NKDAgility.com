    "reasoning": "The content centers on the role, misconceptions, and core accountabilities of Scrum Masters, with focus on principles, competence, and organizational impact. While it thoroughly discusses effective team guidance, coaching, and adaptable practice, it does not mention or deeply engage with human-AI collaboration, distributed cognition involving AI, or any socio-technical/human-AI teaming topics. There are no references to AI, artificial agents, or the emergence of collective intelligence through human-AI partnership. The audience (practitioners in Scrum and Agile) loosely overlaps with those interested in collective intelligence, but the primary intent and substance diverge from the category definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Although the article addresses team effectiveness and Scrum principles, it doesn't discuss or reference human-AI collaboration or collective intelligence. Its focus remains strictly on human team roles and competencies within Scrum, not the interplay of human and AI agents.",

    "reasoning": "The content is exclusively focused on clarifying the Scrum Master role, underlying competencies, and common misconceptions within Scrum. It addresses principles, organizational impact, and continuous improvement in a general agile context, but does not directly or substantively reference Objective Key Results (OKRs), their theoretical basis, implementation, measurement, or integration with other frameworks. There are no meaningful or even superficial references to OKRs, nor discussion of outcome-based measurement as defined by John Doerr's work. While the audience and themes (agile, organizational improvement, accountabilities) are tangentially relevant, no substantial conceptual overlap or explicit alignment with the OKR framework, intent, or methodologies is present. Scores reflect only the most minimal indirect alignment.",

    "reasoning": "The content deeply explores the Scrum Master’s role, focusing on moving beyond mechanical practice toward principles, competence, and accountability. There is substantial discussion of autonomy and continuous improvement, which conceptually overlap with 'agency.' However, it does not explicitly invoke Agentic Engineering as a discipline, nor does it address AI collaboration, systemic observability, or DevOps-infused craft. The main intent is cultivating effective Scrum Masters—relevant to agency but not systematically about engineering for maximised agency of human and intelligent systems. Audience fit is strong for practitioners, with a focused signal. No penalties were applicable as the content is current and respectful.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article stresses autonomy, principles, and improvement in the Scrum Master role, it does not explicitly discuss Agentic Engineering or AI/human agency at the engineering systems level. It aligns moderately on intent and audience but lacks depth on category-specific topics.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses tightly on the proper interpretation of the Scrum Master role, delineating accountabilities and common misconceptions in Scrum practices. Nowhere does it mention autonomous AI agents, agentic delivery concepts, contextual intelligence, or AI-driven augmentation of software delivery teams. The philosophical discussion about principles and improvement, although helpful for Agile clarity, does not map to the unique integration of AI, human expertise, or organisational context central to Agentic Software Delivery. The only possible tangential alignment is that it targets Agile practitioners (partial audience overlap), but there is no substantial or conceptual fit to the agentic category. No penalties are applied, as there is no outdated or contradictory material.",
