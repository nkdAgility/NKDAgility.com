Nowhere does it discuss AI agents, context-aware intelligence, agentic frameworks, or synergy between AI and humans in delivery. It does not reference modern engineering practices or the evolution toward agentic delivery. The theme stays within traditional Scrum mastery and team dynamics, absent of proactive, autonomous systems. Audience is Scrum/Agile practitioners, somewhat near the category's overlap, but all other key dimensions are surface-only for Agentic Software Delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content centers on Scrum Master roles and professionalism, not on agentic concepts, AI agents, or agent-enabled delivery. Minimal to no alignment with Agentic Software Delivery—focus and intent do not match the category definition.",
    "level": "Ignored"
