    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the product owner role within Scrum and discusses balancing innovation, customer needs, and team dynamics. It touches lightly on hypothesis-driven engineering and mentions DevOps, but the primary discussion is general product ownership—not the deliberate design to maximise agency of humans and AI. There is no explicit reference to agentic engineering, and the exploration of autonomous decision-making or ethical AI collaboration is minimal. The target audience aligns moderately, being technical practitioners, but the content largely describes mainstream best practices without delving into the philosophical or structural elements that underpin agentic engineering. Although the use of data-informed decision-making and collaboration aligns tangentially with agency, these are not explored through the agentic engineering lens, resulting in modest scores for alignment and depth. Signal-to-noise ratio is moderately high since the content is focused, but mostly on Scrum and product ownership rather than agentic engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is primarily about advanced product ownership, innovation balance, and Scrum techniques. While themes like hypothesis-driven development and collaboration are present, agentic engineering concepts are only loosely referenced, and the depth specific to agency maximization or ethical AI is limited.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on product ownership, balancing innovation, customer needs, and team dynamics, referencing Scrum and hypothesis-driven engineering. It lacks any explicit discussion of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or techno-social integration. No mention of AI, agent autonomy, contextual intelligence, or embedded agency—which are central to the category—is found. While some modern engineering concepts are referenced (hypothesis-driven engineering), these fit general agile contexts and not specifically agentic delivery. The intent, depth, and alignment are all low in relation to the category, as there is no substantive overlap with agentic software delivery or its defining principles.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about advanced product ownership and agile practices, not Agentic Software Delivery. No discussion of AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic integration. Only general agile themes; confidence in fit is very low.",
