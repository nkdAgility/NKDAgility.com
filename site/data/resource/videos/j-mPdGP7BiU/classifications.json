    "final_score": 10.0,
    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly covers hypothesis-driven testing, experimentation, learning, and evidence-based product development techniques. However, it makes no reference to AI-specific themes, operating models, cross-functional AI roles, model lifecycle management, AI governance, or any unique concerns or practices associated with AI products. Its entire framing is generic product development, not AI. Audience and depth are slightly higher because the systematic, evidence-based approach could relate loosely to product operating models, but none of the core category-defining requirements are met. No penalties apply as the content is not outdated or satirical.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content does not address AI Product Operating Models or AI-specific operating challenges. It is focused on general product development methodologies and so does not fit the category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
