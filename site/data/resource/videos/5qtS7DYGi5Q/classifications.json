The examples and recommendations center only on humans using tools and processes, not on partnerships with AI agents.

There is little explicit or implicit mention of maximizing developer or AI agency, decentralized decision-making, or the philosophical aspects central to Agentic Engineering. The discussion of telemetry, feedback loops, and team engagement only loosely overlaps with Agentic Engineering's themes (e.g., feedback-driven adaptation, systemic observability), but always through the lens of EBM and organizational value metrics, not engineering philosophy or agency maximization. No outdated or contradictory content was found; thus, no penalties were applied. The overall confidence reflects that, while some supporting practices are relevant, Agentic Engineering is not the main or sufficient focus of this content.",
