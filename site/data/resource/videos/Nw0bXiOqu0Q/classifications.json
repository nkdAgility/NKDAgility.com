While the article's primary topic is why recessions are a good time to invest in agile, it frequently and deeply discusses Hypothesis Driven Development's core practices (empirical process control, hypothesis formation/testing, iterative experiments). Concrete H.D.D. terminology appears, e.g., 'develop a hypothesis,' 'design an experiment or run a pilot,' 'incremental and iterative growth.' Most arguments are framed within the lens of learning-through-experimentation and using evidence to drive change. Some portions focus on general agile culture, leadership, and consultancy promotion, which are less tightly aligned.
