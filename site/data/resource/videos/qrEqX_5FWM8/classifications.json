    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on immersive learning within Agile and Scrum contexts, emphasizing practical application, feedback loops, and real-world challenges. There are no explicit or conceptual discussions of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM); traditional models are referenced only tangentially (as 'traditional classroom model'), and this refers to learning delivery, not organizational operating models. Core IOM assumptions (hierarchy, standardized processes, functional silos, etc.) are neither directly mentioned nor analyzed. Depth, alignment, and intent are all extremely low because the central theme is modern workplace learning, not the established industrial model. The only partial relevance could be inferred by contrast to 'traditional' approaches, but these are strictly about training methods, not operating models or enterprise structure. No penalties are needed as the content is current and neutral in tone.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about immersive learning in Agile/Scrum; it does not discuss the Industrial Operating Model's mechanics, assumptions, or structure. No substantive alignment, mentions, or depth related to IOM. Very low fit for this category.",
