    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on the role and performance of product owners, with no explicit or implicit discussion of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM), its structures, assumptions, history, or even direct comparison or contrast. It examines team-level practices (signs of failing as a product owner, advice for taking ownership, product quality, delivery, vision) without reference to hierarchical, process-driven, or centralized organizational patterns—hallmarks of IOM. Even mentions of 'taking orders' or 'requirement-driven' mindsets do not transition into a broader IOM organizational context, nor do they offer analysis of efficiency-focused, stage-gated, or functional silo operations. The audience (practitioners) only moderately overlaps, but only tangentially. The piece contains no outdated or satirical tone deserving penalty. Thus, all scores are very low except audience alignment, which is slightly higher due to the practitioner focus, yet still not strongly relevant to IOM. Confidence is very low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about product owner role and personal/team performance, not the Industrial Operating Model. No direct or substantive discussion of IOM's structures, assumptions, or mechanics appears.",
    "level": "Ignored"
