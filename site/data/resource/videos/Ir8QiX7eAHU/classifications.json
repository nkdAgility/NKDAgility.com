    "reasoning": "The content discusses the Kanban method, focusing on WIP limits to optimize team workflow. While it covers process improvement, experimentation, and workflow optimization, it is centered at the team level rather than organizational design or structure. There is no substantive analysis of how WIP limits tie to organizational operating models, governance, cross-departmental value delivery, or alignment with strategy. Specialized operating models or transformation themes do not appear. Some techniques could indirectly relate to operating model detail, but such connections are not made explicit. Audience is team practitioners, not organizational or strategic roles.",

It provides practical advice for setting and adjusting WIP limits but never addresses, references, or implies any AI-specific concerns, operationalization of AI products, or organizational structures unique to AI product operating models. There are no direct mentions or conceptual alignment with core AI Product Operating Model topics such as model lifecycle, MLOps, AI governance, or ethical deployment. Only superficial, if any, indirect audience overlap, as some Kanban/Scrum practitioners may also work on AI products. Content is strongly off-topic for this category.",

Its intent is instructional for practitioners using Kanban or Scrum, not to explain, analyze, or contrast IOM with other models.
