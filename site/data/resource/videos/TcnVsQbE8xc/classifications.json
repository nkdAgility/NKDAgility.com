Key dimensions (alignment, depth, and intent) are moderate because the focus is on professional growth and agile mastery rather than grounding delivery in measurable customer outcomes or prioritizing based on validated needs. Some elements—such as focus on 'value creation' or feedback—could be linked to customer focus, but mostly in an indirect sense; participants might use these skills in ways that enable customer-focused delivery, but the content itself does not substantively frame learning or action around maximizing customer value as per agile or DevOps philosophies. Audience and signal-to-noise are higher, since it addresses an agile practitioner audience with focused content, but the primary driver is course benefit, not customer outcomes.",
