While it repeatedly references measurement, adaptation, transparency, and alignment with objectives, it never directly cites or discusses the OKR framework. There are no mentions of Objectives and Key Results as defined by John Doerr, nor any explicit coverage of OKR’s superpowers or anti-patterns. The purpose is tightly focused on empiricism—its mindset, practices, and Agile roles—not on outcome-based measurement as formalized in OKRs. While certain practices (e.g., targeting relevant metrics, regular retrospectives, and alignment) relate thematically to components of OKRs, these are presented generically and do not tie to foundational OKR concepts or terminology. The content reflects the right practitioner audience and high focus, but OKRs are, at best, an implicit subtext and never a true subject.",
