The discussion is deep, practical, and aimed at Agile leaders/practitioners. The main intent is to advocate for agile leadership as a practical response to complexity, matching the category's definition. While evidence and examples (like the soup/knife metaphor) underline real-world utility, explicit mentions of 'pragmatic' are few. Target audience matches closely with those interested in Agile/Scrum/DevOps pragmatism. Nearly all content is relevant and focused, with little off-topic material.
