    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the 'Less is More' principle in Agile and Kanban, discussing prioritization, backlog refinement, and Sprint planning to maximize value. There is no explicit or implicit mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, application, or any associated predictive flow metrics. The themes relate generally to Agile ways of working and efficiency, which are adjacent but not directly connected to SLE as defined. The only tangential connection is the mention of Kanban practices, but this does not invoke SLE, nor does the discussion address flow time, forecasts, or probabilities. Depth, alignment, and other scoring dimensions remain low because the focus is on lean principles rather than on SLE or its specific use in Agile or Kanban frameworks. No penalties are applied as the content is not outdated or critical of the concept, just irrelevant to SLE. Thus, the confidence that this content fits the 'Service Level Expectation' category is extremely low.",
