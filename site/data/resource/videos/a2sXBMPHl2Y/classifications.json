    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the benefits of private training in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps contexts. There is no explicit mention or substantive discussion of the Industrial Operating Model, its structures, assumptions, or historical foundations. Concepts such as hierarchy, centralized decision-making, or efficiency-driven functional silos are not discussed, nor does it contrast IOM with adaptive models. The target audience is Agile/DevOps teams or practitioners, not those interested in IOM structures. Overall, the content is unrelated to the IOM except possibly for an implicit contrast when participants say, 'We can't do that here because of XYZ.' But this is not elaborated. There is no direct educational or analytical value for readers wishing to understand what IOM is.",
