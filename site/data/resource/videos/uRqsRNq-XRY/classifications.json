    "reasoning": "The content centers on addressing judgment and psychological safety in Agile teams, not OKRs. Direct mentions of OKRs are absent. While it discusses goal-setting and metrics, they are covered generally, with no reference to foundational OKR frameworks or principles (e.g., Objectives, Key Results, focus, alignment, tracking, or stretch). The discussion remains at the level of healthy team norms within Agile, only indirectly relating to outcome-based measurement. Audience and intent loosely overlap with those interested in OKRs, but the primary focus is not on Objective Key Results. Despite referencing 'meaningful goals' and 'adaptive metrics,' no depth or explicit conceptual alignment with OKR methodology is present.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content primarily explores psychological safety and healthy metrics in Agile teams, lacking explicit discussion or depth on Objective Key Results or their foundational principles. While relevant to goal-setting, it does not meaningfully connect to OKRs.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on fostering a healthy Agile environment by minimizing harmful judgment, encouraging open dialogue, and improving morale, innovation, and continuous improvement. While these concepts support developer empowerment and adaptivity—related to some Agentic Engineering subthemes (such as feedback-driven adaptation, team autonomy, and learning culture)—there are no direct mentions of 'Agentic Engineering' or its core terminology. The depth is moderate, with a practical orientation on team dynamics and psychological safety, but lacks emphasis on engineering practices, AI collaboration, or decentralised decision frameworks. The signal is strong for Agile practitioners, and the audience generally aligns with those interested in transformation and team empowerment, but the philosophical and technological underpinnings of Agentic Engineering are mostly implicit or missing.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article strongly supports autonomy and collaborative improvement in Agile teams—concepts adjacent to Agentic Engineering—but does not directly discuss the deliberate engineering of agency, AI integration, or systemic feedback loops. Its relevance is moderate but indirect.",

There are no mentions or discussion of agentic principles (AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent collaboration, automation frameworks, etc.), nor engineering or technical practices related to autonomous agents. The intent is on Agile team psychology and metrics, not the integration or governance of AI agents or agentic systems. The closest possible link is in discussing adaptive metrics and continuous improvement, but this falls well short of the 'Agentic Software Delivery' definition. The target audience (Agile practitioners) only partially overlaps with the agentic topic’s typical readers.",
