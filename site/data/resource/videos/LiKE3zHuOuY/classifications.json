Core ideas like system-level convictions, evidence of ethos in behaviors, or exploration of authentic transformation are largely missing. It references practices and their impact, but lacks depth on ethos-driven leadership or the sustainability of Agile systems. There are only vague allusions to backbone-like strategies or vital ideas, without explicit linkage to ethos per the classification definition.",
