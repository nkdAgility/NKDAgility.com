    "reasoning": "There is no mention of AI, artificial intelligence, or AI products. The content centers exclusively on the role of senior leadership in general Agile transformation and consulting—relevant to Agile operating models, but not to AI Product Operating Models. While it discusses product development and DevOps in passing, these are presented generically within Agile adoption, not in the context of AI-specific practices, governance, or organizational models for AI productization. The article's main theme, audience, depth, and intent do not align with the unique requirements, governance, or lifecycle management of AI products as defined in the category. At most, the content could be partially relevant if read generously as a broad template for transformation, but the lack of AI context makes it almost entirely out of scope.",
