    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on Agile/Scrum strategies for general software team productivity (Definition of Done, overcommitting, backlog refinement) with no mention of AI, AI product life cycle, specialized roles, governance, MLOps, or any aspect unique to AI product operating models. The only tangential references are to DevOps, and those, too, lack AI-specific context. No relevant audience, signals, or depth for the AI Product Operating Model category. No penalties applied as the content is not critical or outdated.",
