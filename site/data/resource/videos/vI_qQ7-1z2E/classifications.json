    "final_score": 2.0,
    "reasoning": "The content strictly discusses advanced Scrum Master skill development in the context of the PSM II certification and facilitation techniques. There is no mention—direct or implied—of AI, AI product operating models, data/model governance, or AI-specific product lifecycle management. The focus is entirely on traditional Scrum roles, facilitation, and professional growth for Scrum Masters, not on operationalizing AI product delivery or structuring cross-functional teams for AI development. The audience and content are not aligned with the specifics of the AI Product Operating Model category except at an extremely general level regarding team development or accountability, but without any AI context, this connection is minimal, justifying very low scores throughout.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content only addresses advanced Scrum Master skills and PSM II certification; it does not discuss AI product operating models or related concepts. Fit for this category is almost non-existent.",
    "level": "Ignored"
