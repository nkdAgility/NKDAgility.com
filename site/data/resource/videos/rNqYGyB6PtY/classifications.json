There is only a passing reference to how underperforming teams impact the product, organization, and ultimately, the customer. However, there is no substantive or explicit discussion of defining, measuring, or maximizing value for customers, no establishment of feedback loops with users, and no alignment of delivery strategy with customer outcomes. Most of the content relates to team competence, not customer value. Hence, the alignment, depth, and intent scores are low, and the overall confidence that this fits 'Customer Focus' as defined is weak.",
