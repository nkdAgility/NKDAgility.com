    "reasoning": "The content exclusively focuses on agile leadership, Scrum.org's leadership workshop, and broader agile transformation. There is no mention of AI, machine learning, or any principles unique to AI product operating models—either directly or conceptually. The topic centers on agile leadership skills, team alignment, organizational cultural change, and measurement of agility, but never addresses operating model requirements unique to AI products such as MLOps, data/model governance, ethical AI, or AI lifecycle management. The primary intended audience is agile leaders or managers, not AI product operating model stakeholders. Thus, the fit is minimal and only marginally relevant as both may address organizational change, but not in the context required by the AI Product Operating Model category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is on agile leadership and transformation, not about AI product operating models. There are no references to AI, MLOps, or AI-specific governance, so the fit is extremely weak and almost entirely out of scope.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on Agile leadership, workshops, and organizational transformation towards agility. While it indirectly references contrasts with 'traditional management styles,' it does not discuss the Industrial Operating Model (IOM) explicitly or in-depth, nor does it help readers understand IOM's mechanics, assumptions, or strengths. There are no substantive explorations of hierarchical structures, Taylorism, or IOM's effectiveness; instead, the narrative is positioned to support and promote agility. Minimal, indirect connection exists only insofar as contrasting 'agile organisations' with presumably non-agile (traditional/IOM) ones, but these contrasts lack detail or analysis of IOM concepts themselves. All relevant mentions are fleeting and off-purpose, resulting in very low scores across all core fit dimensions.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about agile leadership and transformation; it does not discuss the Industrial Operating Model itself, its structure, or its advantages. Fit for the IOM category is extremely limited and indirect.",
