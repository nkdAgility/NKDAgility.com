While it references Agile, Scrum, and DevOps, and describes a transition from Waterfall, it doesn't discuss foundational beliefs, disciplined stances, or system-level convictions underpinning sustained improvement. The discussion centers on tool and framework application rather than underlying ethos or how these values are evidenced in system behavior. There is little explicit reference to ethos, and findings are presented as achievements rather than explorations of underlying convictions or ethos-driven transformation.",
