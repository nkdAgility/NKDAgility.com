The target audience is broad (practitioners, leaders, general agile teams), while SLE-specific content would likely target Kanban/Scrum practitioners or those managing flow metrics. The signal-to-noise ratio is low for the SLE category, as most of the content is meta-level agile critique with no focus or depth on SLE.
