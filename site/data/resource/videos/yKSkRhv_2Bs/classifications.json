Scrum practices and the course's value are described from a high-level perspective, with generic references to aligning, learning, or refreshing Scrum, but there is a total absence of discussion on making work policies explicit or visible, or using workflow definitions for improvement or collaboration. The intended audience is Scrum practitioners or teams seeking foundational or refresher training, but not specifically those interested in the agile/Kanban Definition of Workflow. There is no outdated content or oppositional tone, so no penalties apply. Scores are set very low across all dimensions and the final confidence is correspondingly minimal, as little to no material fits the definition or scope.",

The main themes center around the benefits of Scrum courses (applied to teams or organizations), without highlighting the specific responsibilities, collective accountability, cross-functional skills, or distinctions of the Product Developer accountability. While the audience (teams working in Scrum) may incidentally include Product Developers, the discussion remains general and lacks any exploration of structure, purpose, or professional practices unique to the Product Developer category as defined.

There is a consistent emphasis on Scrum processes, learning, and course value, rather than on goals, measurable key results, or integrating OKRs with Agile. No authority, terminology, or example aligns with or even mentions OKRs or their underlying philosophy from John Doerr’s work.
