No significant exploration is given to IOM’s structures, assumptions, or where it works well. Explicit demerits are given across dimensions for its problem-focused, non-instructional tone. Its brief description of waterfall has little IOM explanation; most of the text serves as critique and argument for alternatives. Audience and relevancy further reduce confidence.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content critiques 'waterfall' in the FBI Sentinel project, mainly showing its failures, not explaining Industrial Operating Model principles or value. This makes it a poor overall fit for the category.",
