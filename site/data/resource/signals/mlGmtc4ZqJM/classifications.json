    "ai_penalty_details": "Intent (-1): The tone is critical and focused on the DOD's move away from the IOM rather than explaining it. Alignment (-1): The content uses IOM features as a foil to spotlight their obsolescence.",
    "final_score": 35.0,
    "reasoning": "This content focuses on the Department of Defence's historical use of waterfall (a hallmark of IOM: stage gates, approvals, fixed plans), mentioning specific IOM mechanics. However, its main aim is to discuss the transition *away* from IOM, not to inform readers about what the IOM is or where it succeeds; the IOM's principles are described only briefly to highlight the rationale for leaving them behind. While audience and signal remain relatively high due to clarity and targeting change agents, low depth and intent scores reflect the mainly critical framing and lack of substantive explanation of IOM fundamentals. Penalties were applied for intent (critical/undermining) and alignment (using IOM as the contrast, not the subject).",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content mentions Industrial Operating Model features but mainly to critique and contrast them with modern approaches. The focus is on leaving IOM, not understanding or advocating for it, so fit is partial and mainly as negative context.",
    "level": "Ignored"
