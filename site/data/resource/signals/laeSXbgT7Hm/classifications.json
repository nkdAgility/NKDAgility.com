However, it never directly mentions or defines the 'Definition of Workflow' as a formal, explicit set of agreements or policies. There is a conceptual link in discussing WIP limits and constraints, but no explicit exploration of entry/exit criteria or formal workflow agreements. The content also avoids prescriptive process enforcement and remains largely in an agile/lean context. Thus, while relevant concepts are present, the direct scope of the Definition of Workflow is not fully explored.",

The main intent is optimizing process flow, not the deliberate design for human or intelligent system agency.
