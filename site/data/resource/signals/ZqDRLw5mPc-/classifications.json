The piece critiques superficial views of the Scrum Master and highlights a deeper responsibility in fostering cultural change and continuous improvement. While it doesn’t repeatedly use the term 'organisational culture,' its core ideas, intent, and audience are aligned with the category, though the discussion is more centered on roles than the systemic cultural landscape. Depth is good, with some detail regarding broader team and organizational impact, but there are limited direct cultural theory references, and the coverage remains within the Scrum Master context.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content aligns well with the category by positioning the Scrum Master as a driver of organisational change and improvement, not just a facilitator. It thoroughly addresses cultural impact, audience, and intent, but focuses mainly on the Scrum Master role rather than broader culture frameworks.",
