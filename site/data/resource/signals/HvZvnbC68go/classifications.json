It aligns closely with Agile principles that foster responsiveness to change and employs evidence from industry reports. While it doesn't reference DevOps or Lean by name, the focus on fast iteration and value delivery deeply supports adaptability. The depth covers both the problem (feature waste) and solution (continuous feedback) pertinent to the category. Minimal direct naming holds back a perfect score, but strong thematic focus, high relevance for technical teams, and little off-topic content elevate all other dimensions. No penalties applied as the content is current, supportive, and well-aligned.",
