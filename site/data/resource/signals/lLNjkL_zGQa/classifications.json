There are no explicit mentions of decision-making frameworks, evidence-based management, metrics, or structured evaluation of options. The Microsoft case is anecdotal, with only a slight nod to process overhaul (e.g., transparency, 3-week sprints), but without tying to decision-making practices or how choices were made. The intent is to persuade teams to get rid of technical debt, not to facilitate or discuss structured decision-making methodologies, empirical evaluation, or collaborative processes. Some indirect alignment with decision-influencing contexts, but discussion remains surface-level and focused on risk, not method.
