While this is conceptually linked to strategic goals—since cultural change is often part of strategic transformation—the post never directly discusses long-term objectives, strategic goal-setting, or alignment with business agility frameworks. There are no explicit mentions of 'strategic goals,' though themes such as organisational culture, continuous improvement, and value delivery suggest indirect relevance. The intent fits general Agile transformation topics and is targeted at both practitioners and leaders. However, the post’s depth stays just below a truly strategic conversation; its most actionable advice is to 'fix your culture,' without offering details about setting or measuring strategic objectives.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the content strongly emphasizes cultural prerequisites for agility, it only loosely connects to the explicit strategic goals category. There’s meaningful thematic overlap, but it doesn’t directly address long-term objectives or strategic frameworks, so confidence in category fit is moderate—not high.",
