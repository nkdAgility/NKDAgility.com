It references core decision-making elements—change backlogs, empirical feedback, measuring effects, and adapting plans. The phrase 'evidence-based change, one step at a time' directly aligns with the principles of Evidence-Based Management and structured decision methodologies. The text is conceptually aligned; however, explicit mentions of 'decision making' as a term are fewer, resting more on process descriptions and the strategic use of evidence within Scrum. The depth is high due to the practical process suggestions (cadence, backlogs, empirical feedback), but there is no explicit discussion of metrics frameworks or decision-weighting tools. The intent is clearly to foster informed, structured approaches to change, targeting practitioners in Agile and organisational leadership contexts. The audience is appropriate, and almost all details are focused with little off-topic content. No outdated practices or undermining tone is present, so no penalties applied.",
