There is no discussion of how roles, governance, resource allocation, or structural mechanisms are defined at an organizational level to align strategy and execution. The focus is on team-level accountability for quality and completion, not on system-wide frameworks or operating constructs. Direct mention of 'operating model' is absent, and the conceptual scope is restricted to workflow quality gates—not the mechanisms, governance, or alignment functions central to a Product Operating Model.
