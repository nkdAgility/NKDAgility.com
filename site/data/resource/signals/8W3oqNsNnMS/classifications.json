'Mentoring' is not directly mentioned; instead, the narrative centers on leadership, autonomy, and balancing structure with flexibility. There are conceptual overlaps (coaching, removing obstacles, fostering initiative), but direct guidance on mentoring or explicit development of mentoring techniques is absent. The intended audience—Agile practitioners and leaders—aligns well, and the content stays focused without digressing. However, due to the lack of explicit mentoring discussion and more general focus on leadership principles, scores for direct mention and depth are modest rather than high.",
