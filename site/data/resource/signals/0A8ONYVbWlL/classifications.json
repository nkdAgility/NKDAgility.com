While it highlights critical organisational impediments that might relate to scaling challenges, the discussion remains firmly at the level of team roles and their empowerment rather than explicitly addressing enterprise-wide Agile scaling, large-scale frameworks, or alignment across multiple teams/business objectives. There are no explicit references to scaling Agile, enterprise transformation, or large-scale frameworks. The audience is likely Scrum practitioners or team leads—possibly managers—but not specifically enterprise leaders or those tasked with scaling Agile. Thus, there’s partial overlap: the anti-patterns discussed could exist at scale, but the content does not discuss scaling principles, frameworks, or enterprise strategies.
