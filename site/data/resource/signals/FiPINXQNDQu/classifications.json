There is no direct reference to scaling Agile, enterprise-level practices, or frameworks like SAFe/LeSS/Nexus. The content is broadly relevant to product management, but only tangentially touches on ideas remotely related to large scale agility (e.g., stakeholder alignment, influence at multiple levels), and those are contextualized only within the PO role, not in terms of organization-wide scaling.
