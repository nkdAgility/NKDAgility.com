Discussion is more about team enablement through the Product Owner rather than a broad exploration of the Scrum Team accountability itself. The depth is moderate—there are examples and broader reflections but little structural or process detail about the Scrum Team; it's mostly framed around the Product Owner's impact on team effectiveness.
