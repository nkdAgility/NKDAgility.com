It does not explicitly mention 'organisational change' by term or specific change frameworks, but it is highly conceptually aligned—the main theme is the need to rethink how organisations define and distribute work due to AI-driven automation. The depth is strong, diving into why organisational roles exist and suggesting a fundamental shift is needed. The audience appears targeted at organisational leaders or decision-makers.
