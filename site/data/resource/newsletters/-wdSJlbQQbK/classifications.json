    "reasoning": "The content is focused on Agile and Scrum learning journeys, immersive training formats, and continuous improvement, targeting practitioners wishing to enhance Agile skills. There is no mention or substantive discussion of Industrial Operating Model, nor are core IOM themes, assumptions, or mechanics addressed. The only slight linkage is by audience overlap (business and technical professionals), but not in organizational structure, historic context, or efficiency-focused management. Content is almost entirely unrelated to explaining or exemplifying the IOM—it discusses modern, adaptive learning offerings without meaningful contrast to or analysis of traditional, hierarchical models.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is focused on modern Agile/Scrum learning, not explaining or exemplifying the Industrial Operating Model. Lacks IOM references, context, or discussion. Not a category fit.",
