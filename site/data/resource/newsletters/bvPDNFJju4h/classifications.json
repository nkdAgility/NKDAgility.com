References to 'team collaboration' focus on traditional human teamwork with no discussion of AI agency, partnership, or distributed cognition. There is a technical audience overlap due to Agile, Scrum, and product development themes, but the core facets of the 'Collective Intelligence' category—especially human-AI partnership—are not covered, nor are specific socio-technical practices or case studies involving AI teams present. The content remains entirely within the bounds of human skill development and team dynamics, making only extremely tangential or coincidental overlaps with the strict classification requirements.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This workshop content emphasizes human team collaboration and product discovery, without addressing human-AI partnership or collective intelligence as defined. While Agile and product development themes are present, there is no substantive alignment with the Collective Intelligence category.",

    "reasoning": "There is no explicit mention of OKRs or Objective Key Results in the title, description, or body. The workshop and promotional content focus on product discovery, validation, and customer-centric product development—but never connect these themes to OKRs, their terminology, or conceptual framework as defined by John Doerr. The audience (product practitioners, Scrum professionals) could overlap with OKR users, but this content does not address OKRs directly or indirectly. The closest related concept is 'alignment,' as used in 'team collaboration' and 'working towards a common goal,' but this is framed generically rather than with reference to outcome-based measurements, measurable key results, or the OKR discipline. Most content is focused and relevant to product discovery/validation (high signal), but completely misses the OKR dimension.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is focused on product discovery, validation, and customer-centric development, with no mention or meaningful discussion of Objective Key Results. There is no alignment with OKR principles, framework, or terminology, making fit with the category extremely low.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a promotional piece for a product discovery and validation workshop focused on customer-centric development, validation techniques, and team collaboration. It contains no explicit or implicit discussion about Agentic Engineering, nor does it address developer agency, systemic observability, DevOps-infused craft, AI-integration in engineering, or feedback-driven adaptation as defined by the category. Aside from mentioning a trainer with a background in robotics, there are no substantive references to human or AI agency, ethical autonomy, or the deliberate design of engineering practices. The thematic focus is more on product thinking and agile training than on the philosophical or systemic aspects of maximizing agency in software engineering environments. Scores reflect a minimal alignment in audience and signal due to the content's broad appeal to technical audiences and mention of agile practices, but overall the fit is very weak.",

It focuses on product management skills, customer-centric development, team collaboration, and rapid prototyping. However, there are no direct or indirect references to autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or any of the core constructs of Agentic Software Delivery. The content targets a practitioner/product manager audience, but not specifically software delivery practitioners interested in agentic models. There is zero mention of agency, AI, human-in-the-loop, or modern engineering automation. Alignment and depth are extremely low and only reach partial credit because iterative feedback (validation loops) and technology expertise are discussed, though not in an agentic context. No penalties are applied since there is no outdated/contradictory tone.",
