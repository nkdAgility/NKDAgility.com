There are no explicit mentions of collective intelligence or human-AI collaboration. While terms like 'team performance' and 'data-driven decision-making' are present, they refer to human teams and classic Agile practices, not to emergent capabilities from human-AI partnerships.

    "reasoning": "The content outlines upcoming Agile and Scrum training classes, covering topics such as Agile Kata, facilitation, backlog management, and evidence-based management (EBM). While EBM sometimes shares conceptual ground with OKRs in terms of outcome-driven improvement and strategic goals, there is no direct mention of Objective Key Results, OKRs, or their foundational principles as defined by John Doerr. The focus remains on course promotion, skills, and related Agile themes, without any explicit OKR definitions, frameworks, or deep alignment. Discussion on topics like strategic goals remains generic, without meaningful integration with OKR systems. The intended audience is Agile professionals, which could overlap with an OKR-interested demographic, but the core content is not about OKRs. Signal is diluted by course marketing and scheduling, leaving minimal relevant content.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content does not discuss Objective Key Results or the OKR framework. Its primary focus is on promoting Agile and Scrum-related courses, with no explicit or detailed exploration of OKRs. There is minimal conceptual overlap and no substantive alignment with the OKR category requirements.",

The content advertises training on agile practices (Agile Kata, facilitation, backlog management, evidence-based management) that can loosely relate to developer agency and feedback-driven adaptation, but does not explicitly explore agency, ethical AI collaboration, or deliberate design for maximizing human/AI agency. The main aim is promotional, focusing on skills, certifications, and course benefits for agile practitioners rather than engaging with the philosophical or systemic foundations highlighted in Agentic Engineering. Target audience (agile practitioners, scrum masters, product owners) overlaps partially, yet message and content remain focused on general professional development, not on the specialization or ethos of Agentic Engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content promotes agile and Scrum-related training, touching lightly on self-improvement and evidence-based management.

The courses target scrum professionals and leaders but do not reference agency, AI, automation beyond normal Agile practices, or related modern engineering practices.
