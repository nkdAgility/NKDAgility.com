It covers techniques for engaging remote learners, coaching sessions, retraining programs, and flexible delivery in virtual environments. However, it does not explicitly discuss human-AI collaboration, partnerships, or collective intelligence as defined by the category. There is no mention of AI involvement, human-AI teaming, or socio-technical systems integrating AI agents. The emphasis is solely on human trainers, learning approaches, and participant engagement—rather than co-creation or cognition with AI. Thus, only incidental or tangential conceptual overlap exists (e.g., collaborative learning), but this does not fit the strict definition of collective intelligence involving human-AI partnerships.",

The content is primarily operational/logistical with some nods to improvement practices, but not philosophical discussions on maximising agency.
