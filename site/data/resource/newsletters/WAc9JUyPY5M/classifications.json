    "reasoning": "The content is focused exclusively on the application and training of Professional Scrum and agile team improvement, with no explicit mentions of Objective Key Results (OKRs), their theoretical foundations, or implementation. There is a strong emphasis on empiricism, transparency, adaptation, and continuous improvement—concepts tangentially related to OKRs in agile contexts—but at no point are OKRs, their roles, nor John Doerr's framework directly or indirectly discussed. No sections cover alignment, measurable outcomes, or organization-wide objectives as framed by OKR literature. The audience is moderately relevant: agile practitioners, Scrum Masters, product owners, and managers are also common OKR users in organizations, but the subject matter is scoped entirely to Scrum without integration or reference to OKR methodology or principles.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on Scrum practice and team agility, with no references or alignment to Objective Key Results. It does not discuss OKR frameworks, their principles, or implementation, placing it well outside the intended scope for this category.",

    "reasoning": "The content primarily focuses on Professional Scrum and agile training, emphasizing empiricism, transparency, inspection, adaptation, and team performance. It discusses concepts like continuous improvement, customer feedback, and team empowerment, which loosely align with elements of Agentic Engineering (such as feedback-driven adaptation). However, it does not directly reference agentic engineering nor delve into agency maximization for humans or AI, systemic observability, ethical AI integration, or DevOps-infused engineering practice. The target audience (agile practitioners, scrum masters, teams) matches Agentic Engineering's demographic. However, the discussion's depth on agency, decision decentralization, or human-AI collaboration is minimal. Most content promotes training, courses, and podcasts, further reducing depth and conceptual fit. No disqualifying penalty factors such as outdatedness or satirical tone are present.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content addresses Scrum and agile team enablement, lightly touching on feedback and empowerment, but lacks explicit or in-depth alignment with Agentic Engineering. Human/AI agency, decision frameworks, or agentic design principles are not central topics.",
