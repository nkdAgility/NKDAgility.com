All mentions are directed at general agile roles and skills, with no coverage of AI-specific data governance, AI ethics, model lifecycle, or organizational structures for AI-enabled products. While a small portion of the target audience (product managers, for instance) could be relevant to AI product contexts in the abstract, the materials and intent are strictly oriented to traditional agile development, not AI-specific operationalization. No explicit or implicit connection to the AI Product Operating Model theme is found, and all scores remain at the minimum due to absolute lack of relevant content.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content promotes agile/Scrum practitioner training with no direct or indirect mention of AI, operating models, or the unique aspects of organizational AI product delivery. It does not fit the AI Product Operating Model category.",

    "reasoning": "The content heavily focuses on promoting agile training and transformation, with the intent to develop agile practitioners and encourage a new way of working. There are no explicit mentions or substantive discussion of the Industrial Operating Model; nor does it describe IOM assumptions, mechanics, structure, or historical context. While the text implies a shift 'for the 21st century', suggesting departure from old models, it never helps readers understand what the IOM is, where it works, or how it operates. Any implied critique of 'old ways' is too vague for classification. The main audience is Agile practitioners, not those interested in IOM structure or efficiency paradigms.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content exclusively promotes Agile transformation and training, with no substantive explanation, endorsement, or analysis of the Industrial Operating Model. It does not fit the category definition in purpose, themes, or intended audience.",
