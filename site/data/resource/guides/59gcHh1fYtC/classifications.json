Artifacts like Product Goal and Increment are described as means of delivering value, and stakeholders are mentioned, but references to 'customer' are occasional and largely implicit.

The depth of explanation for concepts like empiricism and adherence to framework rules somewhat aligns to first principles, but statements rarely mark them as irreducible or immutable truths in the explicit manner required. The guide's primary audience and intent are a reasonable match, and much of the document is focused and relevant.
