While topics like Time-to-Market, Release Frequency, Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, and Continuous Experimentation are present, these are discussed within the broader framework of organizational value delivery and improvement, rather than as a detailed, principled examination of Continuous Delivery itself. The Guide references practices that support rapid delivery, feedback, and automation, which overlap conceptually with Continuous Delivery, but the subject is never directly named. The content's main focus is evidence-based improvement at the organizational level, only occasionally referring to practices and measures (e.g., Deployment Frequency, Release Stabilization Period) that are core to Continuous Delivery. Those touchpoints yield some conceptual alignment but do not represent a deep, intentional exploration of Continuous Delivery's principles, culture, or primary techniques. The audience is similar (practitioners, leaders interested in modern delivery), but the guide's intent and framing are broader and not primarily centered on software delivery pipelines. Most of the text focuses on high-level management philosophy and measurement, not the applications, automation techniques, or mindset of Continuous Delivery.",

    "final_score": 41.0,
    "reasoning": "The content provides a thorough guide to Evidence-Based Management (EBM), focusing on empirical improvement, measurement, feedback loops, and continuous value delivery. Some concepts—like decentralisation of decision-making, experimentation, observability, and feedback-driven change—are adjacent to Agentic Engineering. However, the document never directly mentions or frames its insights in the explicit context of maximising human and AI agency, ethical autonomy, or AI as design collaborators. It does not explicitly address ethical AI, agency of intelligent systems, or philosophy of engineering autonomy. Its themes overlap (continuous adaptation, decentralised decision-making in innovation, feedback-oriented adaptation), but the explicit agentic framing and AI-component are absent. Thus, the content is generally relevant to the audience and shows conceptual overlap with systemic observability and feedback-driven engineering but lacks direct reference, full alignment, and depth on key Agentic Engineering aspects.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the EBM Guide emphasizes empiricism, feedback, and continuous improvement—concepts aligning with Agentic Engineering's philosophy—it lacks direct, explicit discussion of agency or AI collaboration. The fit is tangential: overlapping themes exist, but the agentic focus and depth are limited.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a comprehensive guide about Evidence-Based Management (EBM), emphasizing measurement, outcomes, empiricism, and continuous improvement in uncertain contexts. However, it contains no direct mention of agentic systems, autonomous AI agents, human–AI synergy, AI-grounded telemetry, autonomy boundaries, or agent governance. The content focuses on empirical and experimental practices for organizational improvement and value measurement—important in agile/DevOps contexts—but does not cover the deliberate integration or proactive intelligence of AI agents in delivery. The audience and many measured signals (CI/CD, innovation, value) are tangentially adjacent to Agentic Software Delivery practices but are not core to the agentic narrative. Thus, while some topics like telemetry, automation, and business agility overlap in spirit, the substantive integration and agency that define Agentic Software Delivery are missing.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about evidence-based management, not Agentic Software Delivery. It lacks references to AI agents, agentic systems, or human–AI integration, so the fit is weak, even if some conceptual overlap exists in measurement and delivery focus.",
