There are no explicit mentions or references to AI, operating models tailored for AI, or specialized governance, lifecycles, or roles for AI product teams. The values and principles are meant generally for software, not specifically for AI products. While some Agile concepts (e.g., continuous delivery, team collaboration) are relevant in any modern delivery approach, there are no discussions of model governance, MLOps, ethical deployment, or AI-specific structures necessary for the AI Product Operating Model category. The fit is extremely limited and purely tangential, reflecting only that Agile may be *used* in AI contexts, but this content makes no such connection.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content sets forth general Agile principles for software development, with no direct or indirect reference to AI, AI-specific operating models, or their unique governance or lifecycle management; fit with the category is negligible.",

    "reasoning": "The content contains no direct references to the Industrial Operating Model (IOM) or its core assumptions. Instead, it fully focuses on Agile software development values and principles, several of which actively contrast traditional IOM (such as prioritizing individuals, responding to change, and self-organization). There is no substantive description, analysis, or contextual framing of IOM structures, mechanics, or use cases; nor is the audience alignment strong, as this is directed at Agile teams rather than those interested in IOM. The only faint relevance is that by emphasizing Agile, it implies a contrast with older models, but this is never made explicit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is about Agile values and principles, not the Industrial Operating Model. It neither defines, explores, nor analyzes IOM, so confidence for this classification is very low.",
