There are no explicit or implicit references to product operating models, organizational structure, governance, or the alignment of strategy and execution. There is no substantive exploration of how migration relates to product operating model frameworks, governance, or cross-functional processes. The audience (organizations undergoing technical migration) may overlap somewhat with the broader target for product operating models, but the topic remains technical and tool-centric rather than organizational or structural. No penalties were applied, as the content is neither outdated nor critical.",
