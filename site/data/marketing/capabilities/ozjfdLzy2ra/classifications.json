    "reasoning": "The content is a guide about engineering mentorship with no text/detail, so direct mentions of 'Change Management' (or its related principles) are absent. The description focuses on mentorship and engineering excellence, not strategies for organisational transition, stakeholder engagement, or transformation aligned with Agile change management. Audience could partially overlap with those interested in change but the focus is on individual mentorship, not organisational change. With no content, assessment relies solely on the description, which does not align with the change management definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content has no information beyond the title and a brief description about mentorship. There is no substantial discussion, mention, or intent related to Change Management or its themes. The fit is extremely weak and clearly off-category.",
