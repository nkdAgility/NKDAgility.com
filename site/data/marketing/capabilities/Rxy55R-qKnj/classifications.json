It references resolving broader organisational teamwork challenges, aligning moderately with Organisational Agility principles. However, the text emphasizes assessment and feedback at the team level, rather than deep organisational or systemic agility themes such as structural shifts, leadership roles, or case studies of transformation. There are few direct mentions of 'agility' at the organisational scale, and the discussion of agility-enabling practices is implicit rather than detailed. Audience is well aligned (leaders, teams, organisations seeking improvement), and the tool's intent (team development for wider organisational benefit) is consistent with the category’s scope, yielding a moderate-to-strong but not comprehensive fit.",
