The consulting programs and outcomes are often described in terms of how people interact, learn, and adapt, all of which relate closely to cultural transformation.

Audience targeting (CTOs, Transformation Leads) fits, and the majority of the content relates to changing how organizations collaborate, make decisions, and build capability.
