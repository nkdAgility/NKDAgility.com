    "reasoning": "The title and description focus solely on shifting from tool-centric to problem-focused strategies, advocating for addressing real problems for better outcomes. There is no direct or indirect discussion of the Industrial Operating Model’s core concepts, assumptions, mechanics, or relevance. No explicit or implicit references to hierarchy, efficiency, centralization, planning vs. adaptation, or any IOM-defining features are present. Audience and signal scores are slightly higher only because a general organizational strategy is addressed, but there is no alignment with IOM-specific themes, assumptions, or historical context.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content does not discuss or describe the Industrial Operating Model; it advocates a problem-focused strategy without reference to IOM’s structure, principles, or applicability. Fit is absent.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on a strategic shift from tools to problem-solving, a theme tangentially related to Product Owner accountability for value delivery. However, there are no explicit mentions of Product Owner, Scrum, or related practices. The discussion does not address the specific accountabilities, decision-making, backlog management, or stakeholder interactions central to the Product Owner role. The audience might overlap (strategy, decision-makers), but substance and direct relevance to the Product Owner category are minimal.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content discusses problem-focus over tools but does not address Product Owner accountabilities, activities, or role specifics. Fit is peripheral and lacks alignment with core category themes.",
