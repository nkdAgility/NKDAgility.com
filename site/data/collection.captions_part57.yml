  title: The Power of Continuous Learning for Product Owners
  description: "Unlock your potential as a product owner! Discover the power of continuous learning and stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of product management. \U0001F680"
  captions: |-
    If there was one thing that new product owners should know above all the other things that we've talked about, that's that they need to focus on continuous learning. They need to be looking at what's happening in the industry, what's happening in the market, what are the new tools and techniques that are available. It doesn't mean you're going to use them; there's always a little bit of a danger of the cult of the new, right? Well, we're using it because it's new, but you need to understand all of the different tools and techniques that are available to you, at least enough to know what thing you might choose for a particular circumstance so you can have a goal. The more tools you have in the toolbox, the better.

    There's a great blog post that I read years ago. It was focused on developers, coders, but the theory applies just the same, and it started with the phrase, "If you're reading this, you're already in the top 10%." And that's because there's only a small number of people that actually focus on continuous learning, that actually try new things all the time, that are actually reading up on different techniques and different topics. They don't have to be new; they can just be new to you. They can be older things that you're going and figuring out. "Crossing the Chasm" was written in the '80s, right? What are the things that you're reading? How do you enable yourself to be in the top 10%? Because that's how you maximise your chances of getting the best gigs, right? You need to be in the top 10%. And if all you need to do to do that is read some blog posts every week, maybe a couple of books a month, that's not a high bar to get into that top 10%. And then you'll be the one with people knocking at your door trying to figure out how to get you to be their product owner.

    So, as a new product owner, read voraciously. Read blog posts, watch videos on YouTube, follow on LinkedIn the other product owners out there that you'll be able to find. Product owners and product managers, what are they talking about? What are they into? What are they teaching you? Learn about evidence-based management, hypothesis-driven engineering, OKRs, all of those marketing things around A/B testing, Mechanical Turk, different tools you can use to enable you to have the information you need to make the best decisions you can around maximising the value of the work done by your Scrum team, or if you have multiple Scrum teams, by all of those Scrum teams. What is it that you're going to do to maximise the value? Continuous learning is the key to that.

    We can help you. We have a bunch of Scrum classes at Scrum.org. We have the Professional Scrum Product Owner, Advanced Product Owner if you want to dive a little bit deeper. But on the side of that, you've also got the Professional Scrum with Kanban, bringing in those flow mechanics and flow stories, Professional Scrum with UX, which is focused on the Lean UX. Go read the Lean UX book if you want to understand what that is. These tools and techniques, along with many others that you can learn online, that we can certainly point you to, are the things that are going to differentiate you from all the other product owners out there.

    You need to focus on continuous learning. If you find it hard to focus on continuous learning, if you don't know where to look or what to do, then my team at Naked Agility can help you or point you in the right direction to find the help you do need. Don't let the plethora of misinformation out there get in your way. We can help you filter all of that nasty stuff and get to the nuggets of gold that will help you stand out as a product owner. Use the links in the description to get in touch, and let us help you.

  title: 'Redefining Agile’s Core: Beyond Rituals and Procedures'
  description: "Discover the true essence of Agile with Ken Schwaber! Learn how to innovate software development beyond rituals for better results. \U0001F31F"
  captions: |-
    So there's a quote from Ken Schwaber: "Agile is not about rituals; it's about developing software in a different way." I would broaden it out first and say, "Agile is not about rituals; it's about developing products in a different way." It's broadening that out in organisations. The goal is not agility; the goal is not the rituals, right? They're part of the system, but they're not the thing you're trying to achieve.

    Most organisations seem to measure success in adopting Agile as, "Is everybody doing a daily scrum? Does everybody have a Sprint review?" And those things, those measures, the behavioural outcome from those measures is that you end up with zombie scrum or mechanical scrum, right? Or mechanical processes. People are following the processes because they're told to follow the processes, not because they believe that they are the right processes to follow in order to get the outcomes that the business needs. And that's where the failure is. Why are people just following the rules? Why don't they believe in the rules? Because if they believe in the rules, they'll perhaps make better decisions, right? If they believe that this is the way we need to do things, they'll figure out better and more effective ways to do things.

    And this is actually why it's really hard when you purchase large-scale, sweeping software systems that take care of, like, let's say your entire procurement pipeline is now fully automated. But now you're stuck in that automation; you're stuck in the rituals that that automation has created. And that's the difference between how we've implemented the Toyota Way in the West and how Toyota implemented it. Toyota didn't have a fully automated production line; they had lots of pieces of automation for the work that people do, but they had people checks at the end of every one of those pieces of automation because you're building big, complex products. It's a big, complex system, and computers are not actually that great at managing big, complex systems because they only manage what we think of for them to manage, right? We have to think of it in order for it to be managed.

    So you end up with stuff built on top as you figure out different edge cases and different scenarios. And it's the same with our policies and procedures in organisations, right? It builds up this organisational or software craft that is all the rules around which it runs. And that's the same as delivering, trying to deploy or install Agile in your organisation. It's not about the rituals; it's about doing things in different ways, right? You want to build software in different ways; you want to build products in different ways; you want to do business in different ways that maximise the return on investment. That's what Agile is all about—doing things in different ways.

    If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.

  description: Discover NKD Agility's mission and purpose with Martin Hinshelwood, as he reveals what drives our passion for Agile practices.
  captions: |-
    The purpose of naked agility is to help organisations create great teams. It's something that I've... it's plainly obvious when you say it, but if you have unhappy, sad people, you're not going to get good work out of them. You're not going to build great products. I believe that every person deserves to be using great products. We, as customers, we, as users of products, don't deserve bad, shitty products. We don't deserve that. We deserve great products that provide us with a great experience and do great things for us to help us do the things that we need to do. Unhappy, sad teams don't create great products; they create bad, terrible products.

    In order to have happy, engaged people, we need to create those ideas of great teams within our organisation. How do we engage with people? How do we enable them to be the productive story that we're trying to create? In the creative world, in the software world, that means autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Right? Autonomy is we need to be the ones making the decisions. We need to be the ones that are on board, that are engaged in the story. The people doing the work need to be engaged in the story. We certainly need to also be masters of the work that we're doing. We need mastery, we need expertise, we need skills, we need knowledge. We need to be able to be the best that we can be at what it is that we're doing. Lots of organisations suppress that.

    We need purpose. We need to understand what direction we're going and why we're going there, and how the work that we're doing contributes to that story. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what we're working on. Like, why would I care about the product if I don't know what it's for or who it's helping? And if I don't care, what care am I taking in the product, in the work that I'm doing? I'm taking less care because I don't care.

    Enabling... you can't just tell people to care, right? You have to enable. You have to create an environment within which the people that are participating, that are working on the software products that you want to create and use and develop, care about what they're doing. They have that autonomy, they have mastery, and they have purpose. And that's how we create great teams that create great products.

  title: The Synergy Between Product Management and Product Development in Agile Environments
  description: Explore the vital partnership between Agile Product Management and Product Development. Learn how their collaboration drives innovation and market success!
  captions: |-
    When we're building products, there are really two main parts of the consideration that we have. We need to think about product management and we need to think about product development. So product management is deciding what we're going to go build. Product development is figuring out how we're going to go do that, and they need to be able to complement each other in a way that we're working together towards a successful working product. But product management leads the product development. The product management sets the direction, the strategy, the goals that we're trying to achieve, the high-level goals, strategic goals, and product development focuses on the actual delivery of those goals and delivery of those outcomes.

    Now, that doesn't mean that there's no product management in product development or there's no product development in product management. There's definitely a bleed over between those two topics. They're not a distinct thing that somebody hands over from here to here. They're an integrated story, and I think a good analogy for that is the evidence-based management story that helps, at least it helps me think about not only how they interact with each other, but how they complement each other and how they need each other. Product management and product development need to be successful and working together to be successful.

    So the way evidence-based management breaks this down is you've got two sets of metrics at the top of the diagram, which is market value. So in the context of market value, that's where we're talking about product management. We're focusing on two things: we've got our current value in our product, the stuff that's there that maybe we need to maintain, maybe we need to remove, maybe we need to augment in some way. That's the features and capability that we have in our product right now, and all of those features and capability in our product right now should all work. That working usable product we have increments that work, and our current increment, our current product, is our current value. That's what we've currently got; that's part of our market value.

    If you're not in a consumer-facing world, then think about the market that you deliver to as inside of your business. It doesn't necessarily have to be outside of your business; it doesn't have to be a commercial market. It could be an internal market inside your business. And then the other side of that is the unrealised value, and that's where I think a lot of product management maybe doesn't focus but should focus, in this unrealised value area, which is the stuff that our product could do that it doesn't do yet. The net new functionality that we want to bring in, the net new functionality that we want to bring into the story, is going after new markets, new users. We want more people to be using our product than were using it before because you're always going to have a decline in the people that use your product if the features remain stagnant. Even if you add new capabilities to an existing feature, there's still that tail-off that we're keeping our existing user base happy, and our existing user base is always going to juice over time if we don't do anything.

    We might still be bringing in new customers, but the existing people are going to tail off. That's how I think about it. I think about it a lot like Netflix creating new content. If you have an existing show, the viewership for that show is going to decline over time. It's not new anymore; people that have watched it are not necessarily going to watch it again, although some people do, and it's going to decline over time. That's a little bit more drastic than a product that people use in a business, but the idea is that you're not gaining a lot of new customers. When you do a second season of an existing season, you know the viewership is going to be less in the second season. It's always less. But does it maintain high enough for you to justify the investment?

    What we really want to be doing is focusing as much as we can, while supporting and maintaining our existing investment in our product, in our story, in our existing customers. We also want to be aggressively going after new markets and new customers. That's product management leading. Where are we going? What are we trying to achieve? What's our direction? What's our strategy for building a more valuable product? Value creation; we're creating more value. That's that unrealised value, and those two together, unrealised value and current value, is that agile product management story that leads to market value. That's what we're measuring: market value.

    The activity is product management, but then we've got the product development, which is supporting that story. Product development is our organisation's capability. That's our ability to deliver the things that we identify that need to be delivered and perhaps input to those things as well. Provide part of the feedback cycle; that's what I mean by the bleed over. Product development is going to have good ideas too that we might want to implement. But that's broken into two sets of metrics in product development. One is the ability to innovate. That's how much time can we spend on net new versus maintaining and supporting existence. That's how we're measuring that amount of time that we spend on net new.

    Then the other side of that, to balance it off, is time to market. How quickly can we go from an idea to getting it into production? So ability to innovate and time to market both talk about product quality, talk about engineering excellence. That's our agile product development. Product development is about building high-quality, usable, working products that are of value to somebody. That's just product development. Agile product development is just the newer practices in that story.

    So we've got this product management leading, looking at the market, looking at the futures, looking at what customers are going to need in the future, what our stakeholders are going to need in the future, and trying to anticipate those needs by running lots of little experiments. Some of those experiments will be implemented by product development, so we can then get the results. Ultimately, delivering usable, working product enables us to maximise that value return because we're closing those feedback loops.

    So we've got product management leading with strategy and direction and vision. Value and validation is product management's focus. In order to get that value and validation, we need to actually build something. We need to actually create something that we can then put in front of our users, our stakeholders, to then gather feedback and actually see whether it is actually valuable. Are they actually using it the way we expect? Is it actually changing the number the way we would like? And that's how agile product management leads but is supported by product development. Product development supports that story of collecting that data, that telemetry, that additional information that product management can use to figure out whether we are actually going in the right direction. Do we need to stay the course? Do we need to pivot? Or do we need to stop?

    Maybe we have insufficient user understanding. Maybe we believe that what our users say is the truth. Well, this is what they say, but guess what? Do we really understand what the need is? Do we have all the data evidence to find the best ways to bring solutions to fulfil users' needs? This is a valid question. 

    Maybe we are facing reactionary development. Okay, customers want it because competitors did it. Is it really so? That's another question. Maybe we are facing insufficient collaboration with our stakeholders, and this is not healthy.

  description: "Uncover the truth behind burndown charts in Agile! Join Martin from NKDAgility as he debunks myths and explores better alternatives. \U0001F4CA\U0001F4A1"
  captions: |-
    Another ghost of Agile past is burndown charts. You know, I always, always had a problem with burndown charts. There was just something niggling at me that there was something wrong with them. Everybody seemed to talk like they were the holy grail of monitoring a team. But when you start thinking about just-in-time planning, just-in-time planning doesn't just extend to the product backlog, it also extends to the sprint backlog. And if we do just-in-time planning, how could you possibly have a burndown that reflects the team, the work that the team's working on? Think about it. The way a burndown works is it goes from top left to bottom right. It goes from a list of all the stuff that we need to deliver burns down towards that trajectory of we've delivered all the stuff in it. In order to do that we have to understand all the stuff that's going to come into the sprint backlog at the start. This is why you see lots of teams and organisations fixated on that once you've brought things into the sprint backlog you can't change the scope. Crap, right? The idea that you can't, that if you're going to remove something from the sprint backlog you have to bring in something of equal size and all of that stuff that is really really just smacks of traditional project thinking right we've got scope we want to maintain that scope we want to control that scope so we're gonna have this burndown that we want to be on this line of that and it's just just a crap. The worst way to do burndowns is if you are burning down hours on tasks. That's probably the worst form because it implies that we've built all of the tasks with all of the hours at the beginning of the sprint. And I don't mean all, right? There's at least one person out there is sitting there thinking, but Martin, we don't plan all of this stuff, but maybe we get 90% of the way there. I'm saying 90% is crap. I'm saying 70% is crap. I'm saying 50% is probably crap, right? We discover more by doing than we could by thinking up front. That's the fundamental context within which Agile sits. And anybody that thinks that they can build products that don't exist yet and have a higher than 50% probability of the things you bring in being the things you need is, I don't know what they're smoking but it would be great to get some of that stuff. Because it's just not how the world works. How the world works. When we have that high degree of probability that things will be different, low predictability in what we think's gonna happen and what actually happens, we need a different way to manage the work. We need to manage the work empirically and in any empirical process which Scrum is founded on empiricism, most of Agile is founded upon empiricism, in any empirical process you're not going to know what it's going to take to do something. That's the first part. So if we're thinking we can create a whole big list of hours at the start and then burn down and see that we're on that trajectory, that's not gonna happen. 

    So a solution for that that many teams have tried or many teams that I've seen have tried is to do burn down in story points so instead of burning down the hours they burn down the story points so it's slightly less granular or go even more less granular and burn down in stories right so you get that more jagged line rather than a smooth line but the real and that's a little bit better at least if we're 50% way through the sprint and we're 50% delivered value that's probably the best that the burndown is going to get right in in that world where we've brought 10 things into the sprint and we're gonna deliver 10 things if we're halfway through the sprint and we've delivered five of them things are going good if we're halfway through the sprint and we've delivered three of them, things are not going good, right? That's probably, there's a lot of assumptions in there that things are of similar size, there's all kinds of assumptions in there, but that's probably the best of that world. 

    But the reality is that all of those are predicated on the idea that you've decided what that thing is up front. You've decided how many of those things you're going to bring in up front. And whether it's hours or story points or stories, that's not how it works. Most teams have a higher degree of volatility. They're not just thinking about the value that they're delivering in the sprint, their sprint goal. They're also thinking about how much technical debt do we have to pay off? How much refactoring do we maybe have to do as we're building this product? They're thinking about that, those little bugs that keep, you know, that steady stream of small, inconsequential but valuable defects that keep coming through the system you don't want them building up so you've got to take some of them on and responding to the business and the business needs something and be able to respond to it or production issues or there's too many ors the reality is you are much better focusing on the flow of value through your system and maintaining a steady consistent flow as much as you can within the bounds of the work that you're doing, than on trying to meet some arbitrary top left to bottom right graph, burn down. That's just ridiculous, and it is one of the ghosts of Agile past. 

    If you are being haunted by these ghosts of Agile past, we can help you exercise them or find a coach, consultant, or trainer who can.

And when we come back, we do a debrief, but it's a facilitated debrief. So it's not just myself or one of the other trainers doing the debrief; it's your colleagues in the class, the other people that are participating, who've also tried the same thing. They're providing their input, their review, their reflections on what you've tried, and you can provide it on what they've tried. And hopefully, we can build a much bigger body of experiential knowledge.
