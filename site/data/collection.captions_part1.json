    "description": "Unlock your team's potential! Discover 3 key strategies for agile leaders to uplift underperforming teams in this insightful video. ðŸŒ±ðŸš€",
    "captions": "So the question is, what can a leader pragmatically do with a team that is identified as incompetent, right, but identified as deficient in some way? Before you resort to any kind of firing, there's plenty of things to do. You may want to bring in training. Training is a good way to broad pace some knowledge across a group of people. They might not remember everything that they learned, but I do find, although we might remember 20 to 25% of what we learned in a class, we learn that 25% is spread across all of the capabilities that you maybe learned. Maybe there's 30 topics, or let's say there's 25 topics, and you remember 1% of each of those topics. That 1% of the total course in each of those topics that you remember enables you to know where to go look, where to go find that additional information.\n\nAs long as the people that you've got have some kind of willingness to do things themselves, discover, right, then you can just broad paste some training. Perhaps applying professional Scrum for software developers, right? Get some broad paste of these modern engineering practices across the team. At least they're understanding them and thinking about them, and they can go do additional research on those topics. It shows commitment from the organisation on updating. \n\nBut if they're already in, I guess I would say, a dejected state, I worked at an organisation in the UK, another bank, and they had... I worked beside somebody who believed themselves to be unemployable because they hadn't done anything new in four years. That kind of depressive, dejected, they're already unhappy but don't know what to do about it state. You might find that over time they learn not to learn, right? They stop learning, they stop figuring stuff out because they're like, \"Why bother if I'm not going to be allowed to do anything?\" \n\nSo you need to build that back in slowly. You need to start encouraging them to learn new things. It might not be that you encourage them to learn; you might say, \"You need to learn this new thing so we can do this new capability.\" Have them learn the thing and then do the new capability. Have them learn the thing, do the new capability, suggest they learn the thing, drop in the new capability, right? So then they're expected to... it has them have that feeling of, \"If I learn it, I get value from it,\" rather than, \"If I learn it, I'll not get value from it because nobody's going to let me use it.\" \n\nSo you have to start building back in that capability into the team, into the whole organisation, right? Because people don't get that way out of the box. Most people that I have ever worked with, most teams, most people that I've ever worked with, are interested in learning more about their field unless the organisation has beaten it into them that they're not going to be able to use anything they learned. \n\nI spent my early career as a .NET developer, hopping between companies because I would go to a company because they were using .NET too, and then I would be working there for a couple of years. About halfway or three-quarters, you know, a year to 18 months in, .NET 3 would become available, and I'd be starting to learn that technology and then asking them, \"So when are you going to use this new technology?\" And they'd be like, \"Maybe in 3 or 4 years.\" And I'd be like, \"Okay, I'm job hunting then for somewhere that's pulling in .NET 3.\" \n\nThen I'm going to go work with that, not .NET 3. When .NET 4 comes out, I'm going to be learning that new technology, and then if my organisation isn't willing to change, then I'm going to change, right? Change your org or change your org. I think that continuous move into technology maintained my ability to be employable, my ability to learn and grow my knowledge and career. I personally wasn't afraid to switch between companies, but lots of people are, right? \n\nSo it can be beaten out of them very easily. That was through a number of organisations, investment banking as well as other stuff. But you need to create an environment within which people are rewarded. That doesn't mean financially, but rewarded for learning new things and figuring out new ways to do things. Do you give people the freedom to try stuff out? Do you give them the freedom to fail? \n\nDoing something about doing new stuff is... you might find things that don't work, right? Well, yes, we can do it this way. No? Okay, well, this bit doesn't work. We're down a dead end; we need to backtrack a bunch and then go down a different route. There's some waste in that, but the waste that you get from that is often overshadowed by the clever and interesting ways that you solve those problems and the capabilities that those ideas bring to the organisation. \n\nYou don't open out new markets, new capabilities, get new users by just staying in your lane. You have to be continually switching lanes and figuring out what the best way to solve a problem is. So if you have a team that you take over as a product owner or as a development manager or any way you come into contact in leadership with a team, if it feels like they don't feel they're allowed to learn, that they're allowed to use new things, that they're allowed to do stuff, you need to fix that problem in your organisation. Fix the system, and then you'll start seeing a difference in the teams. You'll start seeing a different vibe, a different capability, a different interest in solving problems in clever and interesting ways.\n\nThanks for watching the video.

    "title": "Introduction to Agilityâ€™s Ghosts: Shedding Dogma and Embracing Pragmatism",
    "description": "Uncover the truth about agile certifications! Join Martin as he challenges perceptions and reveals their impact on learning and growth in the agile world.",
    "captions": "One of the ghosts of Agile past is certification. We've been hearing a lot about it recently, with many folks being very dismissive or pooping on certifications a lot. I want to kind of add to that pile a little bit but also validate some of the value that we get from certifications.\n\nCertifications have had a significant impact on our industry because they get in the way. They kind of get in the way of learning a little bit. They really shouldn't get in the way of learning, but they do get in the way of learning. People get jobs because they have certifications, not because they are actually able to do stuff, and people chase certifications rather than the knowledge that is the thing that those certifications are supposed to assess.\n\nI'm going to say this now, absolutely categorically: there is no two-day course that any of you can go on and then pass a certification that will enable you to be the thing that the certification enabled you to pass. At the very most, I think of it like passing your driving test. Right at the moment when you are 17 or whatever age it is in your area that you passed your driving test, were you the most awesome driver out there? No, you were not. You were the minimum. You had the minimum information you need to not be a danger to those around you. Quite often, not even that. But mostly, the idea behind a driving test and the driving training that you get, which you don't have to do training for; you can just sit the test, is to ensure that you're not a danger to others.\n\nDoes getting your driving test mean you can also ride a motorbike? Probably not. Can you drive a ten-ton truck? Probably not. All of those things are additional licenses and certifications you need to get in order to do those other things, and usually, they come with additional limits and constraints as well.\n\nWhat I think the value of certifications is, well, the certification itself, if you just get given the certification, is not valuable. The value is in some kind of assessment at the end of your course, regardless of whose assessment that is. The value of it is whether you were paying attention to the core things that were expected to be paid attention to. Did the trainer manage to cover the core things that we expected to be in the class? Did I, as a student, understand the core things as they're intended to be in the class? Those are the minimum bars that we would like to meet, and sometimes things happen; sometimes we don't meet them. Having some kind of certification can help validate that knowledge a little bit.\n\nBut ultimately, if you're using certifications for job interviews or you're using them for some kind of professional acumen, or forbid this, if you've just passed a Scrum Master certification and now you've put Scrum Master on your LinkedIn profile or Agile Coach because you've passed an ICF certification, then get that off there as quickly as possible unless you've got the experience to back it up. You are not the thing. My first Scrum Master job is not the same as being a Scrum Master. So if you're selling yourself as a Scrum Master and you haven't even had your first Scrum Master class job, then that's probably not a good idea.\n\nMost of the best Scrum Masters that I've met did not go on a Scrum course and become a Scrum Master. They became a Scrum Master and then they went on a Scrum course. The way they became a Scrum Master was the team that they worked in selected them for that role because they were the most competent person on the team within the context of maximizing the effectiveness of that team. That's how the best people become Scrum Masters.\n\nSo if you want to be a Scrum Master, my advice would be to join a team that uses the skills that you already have and demonstrate to that team that you provide value, are effective, and are interested in their effectiveness, and can help them. They will select you to be their Scrum Master. It's not really a job title.\n\nThat's the certification ghost of Agile past. If you're being haunted by these ghosts of Agile past, we can help you exercise them or help you find a coach, consultant, or trainer who can. Don't let these phantoms undermine the effectiveness of your value delivery. The longer they linger, the more they'll haunt your team's progress or even destroy it.\n\nSend me an email to Martin at nkd agility dot com, and we will help you get to the bottom of it. If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at naked agility dot com. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you."
