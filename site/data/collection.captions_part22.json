    "captions": "Joanna is one of the most competent trainers in the ScrumDog space I've ever worked with. I think part of it is her background; she has deep technical expertise, a PhD in robotics, which puts the rest of us to shame. \n\nBut she just has this way of communicating, and the way she cuts through the BS in classes is just amazing. She has this great way of communicating, and her knowledge and depth of understanding of agile leadership, user experience, and all of these tools and techniques that we talk about is just beyond compare."

    "description": "Discover why many early agile transformations failed and learn how to achieve success in your organisation with insights from Martin Hinshelwood.",
    "captions": "So the question is, why did so many of the early agile transformations fail? I think a better question is just, without the early part on it, right? Why do so many agile transformations fail? Because the early ones failed for the same reason as they do now. \n\nThat's the people who are doing the implementation are not involved in the process of deciding what we're implementing. Right? That's why it fails. Because your leadership decides we're going to do it this way, and everybody else goes, \"Okay, but that's the wrong way.\" Suddenly, they're resistive and unhappy because they feel like it's imposed upon them. \n\nIf you know that old saying, \"If I'd been asked, I would have...\" right? They would have said to do something different. You get that through organisations, and it can be agile transformations, it can be digital transformations, it can be just changing something, right? \n\nThe top-down command and control triangle model in alpha organisations, right? Where you've got the people at the top making the decisions and the people at the bottom doing the work. All the decisions are made at the top, and we steer the rest of the organisation based on those decisions. You're always going to get into that situation where the people that you need to do the stuff don't want to do it because, in this context, they're smarter than you are. \n\nThey have more information, they have more understanding, and they perhaps have more skills in that space. So they're the ones that should be involved in driving it. I think there's been a lot of good work done by open space agile and specifically, as well, on top of that, open space beta to allow methods and systems to be created, a practice to be created that allows you to involve everybody in the organisation in making those decisions. \n\nIf you involve everybody in the organisation in making those decisions, then even though it might not be the decision that they would have made if they were sitting there on their own, right? Because they were involved in making that decision, they feel like their voice is heard. If they feel like their voice is heard, they're more likely to get behind whatever the ultimate decision was because it's a collective decision, right? \n\nDecentralisation and democratisation of the ideas, and then they'll be supporting and helping with the transition as you move forward rather than getting in the way and hindering because they just don't care, because you didn't ask me anyway. \n\nThat's what I think is why agile transformations fail, and I think it's just as true today as it was in the early days. It's just in the early days, there was a small number of high-profile agile transformations, and today, there are hundreds of thousands of actual transformations going on."

    "description": "Discover the key insights Martin Hinshelwood gained as a scrum trainer, transforming training experiences in agile environments. Join the journey!",
    "captions": "So the question is what's the most valuable thing I've learned training people? I think it's that there's two things that are kind of related. One is no matter where you are in the world, everybody's got the same problems when they're implementing Agile, when they're trying to do Scrum, when they're trying to think about the implications of empiricism and a value focus on their organisation. Everybody runs into exactly the same walls. Everybody runs in Texas; they think their walls are unique, but everyone runs into the same walls.\n\nBut the value that I find for me is I love the engagement that I get in multicultural, multi-time zone, multi-country training events much more than I do from single country events because I feel like there's a little bit of echo chamber in a single country event that there aren't as many different ideas generated. I think it kind of demonstrates that value in globalisation, right? You're teaching a class and you've got, you know, even five people from the US, five people from the UK, and they're bouncing off each other. Then that one student that's from Eastern Europe will say, \"But what about this type of thing?\" Oh, never thought of that, right? Because it's not even within their sphere of experience.\n\nAnd those ideas coming in, I think, helped me appreciate the diversity of cultures, but it also results in a better training experience for the students because they get more conversation, more topics, more—disagreement's not the right word—but more ideas coming in there. And for me, that's the most valuable."

    "title": "How much of an impact can a great agile consultant have?",
    "description": "Discover how a skilled agile consultant can transform your team's approach to product development, navigating complexity and driving success in uncertain environments.",
    "captions": "Foreign\n\nHow much of an impact can a great ideal consultant have? I think they can have a huge, huge impact because they're not an agile consultant. A consultant tends not to be interested in hanging around. That's the difference I feel between consulting and coaching. A coach is going to be there all the time, but a consultant can't be there all the time. Usually, one, because they're more expensive, right? So the company doesn't want them hanging around for too long. But really, the consultant is doing that deliberately, right? If the company wants you around full time, you're not expensive enough. Because you want to be coming in, helping them with very specific problems. They're the ones that are going to be fixing the problem. They're the ones that are going to be doing the work. You're giving them things to try or perhaps...\n\nOne of the things that I've done quite a lot with organisations is, I guess I call it the state of agile report, right? And what is the current state of the way things work inside of the organisation from the perspective of agile? And what are the things, like what are the top three things that the organisation should focus on improving? And so I'm not necessarily there to solve any of those problems, right? I maybe come in for a week or two weeks. I'm going to interview 20 or 30 people in the organisation at all different levels, ask them questions about how they work, how they figure things out. And you get a lot of answers that are contradictory in that story, right? Because you get the people actually doing the work saying, \"Yeah, we don't really write unit tests and we don't really have automated builds.\" But then you speak to leadership and they're like, \"Yeah, we've got continuous delivery and we've got all these unit tests coming out of our ears.\" And maybe we've got too many unit tests. And there's a fundamental disconnect there because leadership and organisations will often say, \"I've heard in my leadership grapevine that we should be doing unit tests.\" And then the teams feel under pressure to do unit tests, so they'll just tell them that they've done unit tests because maybe the product that they're working on is absolutely impossible to do unit tests. But it's not possible to have that conversation with leadership because there's not an open and transparent relationship going on there in the organisation.\n\nSo being able to find and identify those problems, figure out what it is that... Oh, and these are big things that need to change, not little things. They're not subtle things like coaches come in and fix subtle things and work on the bigger things over a longer period of time. But that often takes too long because you're going to put that out there. It takes too long. What you want to be able to do is go into an organisation, see a switch on the wall that at the bottom it says \"not continuous delivery,\" at the top it says \"continuous delivery,\" and you want to figure out how do I flip that switch? How do I just turn that on? How do I just fix this problem? And quite often, you're not always going to be right. And I always, when I go into organisations, I'm always explaining that, right? I'm saying, \"I'm going to give you things to try. They might not work for you. They maybe have worked in other places, but things to try.\" And they try them, and either it works for them or it doesn't, right? And then they can come back and say, \"Well, we tried this and it didn't work, but it worked a little bit, right? So what else can we do to figure this out?\" And that's that consulting moment that I think coaches do as well, right? But this is just taking that piece off and saying, \"Let's just do this piece.\" Because I feel that organisations and leaders in organisations, people and organisations need to own that problem themselves. They're the ones that's their organisation. They're in the crap that they're in. They need to deal with figuring out how to get out because if you get somebody in who's given accountability for changing that problem but isn't really part of the company or doesn't really understand the company, it can be very difficult for them to affect change. And that's why it takes longer because then they have to build all of those relationships before they can change.\n\nBut quite often, when you come in as a consultant, you're not worried about being fired, right? That's the first thing because you've got another gig next week and you're not coming back. You might not be coming back at all. So you can just be absolutely brutally honest in your reporting and say, \"This is what's going on in your organisation. This is why it's broken. These are the things you're going to need to fix. I recommend you go find a coach and help you fix this thing.\" But then they know that's what they need to fix. They have it in the front of their mind and they're potentially thinking they can see that switch in the wall and like, \"If we could just flip that switch,\" and they're figuring out more things to do. And I think that's why I think that great consultants can be more valuable than great coaches because their focus is on flipping that switch as quickly as possible.\n\nAnd flipping things quickly, like ripping the Band-Aid off, right? You don't want to peel it slowly because that's going to hurt more. You want to just rip it off, do something different, and deal with the fallout of that bigger change. And I'm going to say, \"Well, it depends,\" right? That's why you need a great consultant because the great consultant is going to be able to go, \"Yeah, you want to slow change that one and you want to fast change this one,\" right? Because if you slow change that one, it's going to be a problem. And if you fast change this one, it's going to be a problem. And that's... things that people feel are unique to their organisation, but they're really not.\n\nOne of the things that I always find really interesting is every single consulting customer I've ever worked with has said, \"We have these magical unique problems and we need your help with them.\" And I go in and their problems are not magical and they're not unique. They're the same problems that everybody else is having. There's little fine nuances of difference, right? But the big problem is the big problem that everybody's having. And part of that comes from a Taylorism to Volatism, right? So from a traditional hierarchical Industrial Revolution thinking focused on things changing to a democratized self-organisation, distributed thinking focused on people, right? So those are the one of the two big bridges that need to happen in organisations. But there's lots of other things that are small that they can do within those structures that will enable them to do better, right? But you've still got those big problems that are the same everywhere because everybody's trying to do this decentralized self-organising teams, but they're in a hierarchy with steering and leadership and control from the top. And they're just... but they're mutually exclusive, right? You can get a little bit of this inside of this, but you can't get all the way over here where people want to be, where they see the biggest benefit in what they're getting.\n\nSo I feel that's the value of a consultant, is being able to come in and quickly identify and point at things that need to change. And a lot of these things are really obvious when you come in from the outside, but they're not obvious at all when you're inside of that story. And having somebody come in and do it... I'll point out also quite often I come in and the sponsor for me coming in says, \"Here's the things we'd like you to tell leadership,\" right? Because they already know what the problem is, just nobody's listening to them. And they need somebody else to come in and say, \"Yes, this is indeed a problem that you've been told a whole bunch of times.\" And I'm only going to do that if those things are actually true, right? If I'm going to look and see. But it's really valuable to have somebody with knowledge and experience coming from the outside that's maybe recognised inside of the organisation in that traditional hierarchy to help make that start making those changes across to the other side of the wall."

    "title": "How big is the gap between an average developer and a great Agile Developer?",
    "description": "Unlock the secrets to becoming a great agile developer! Discover the power of self-investment, practice, and continuous learning. 📚💡✨",
    "captions": "So the question is how big is the gap between an average developer and a great agile developer? I think there's two parts to that, but the main part that I think is really important is, um, I read a blog post years ago and I was sitting reading it, and the first sentence it started with was about this topic, right? What makes great developers? What's learning? All of these kind of things. And the first sentence was, \"If you're reading this, you're already in the top 10 percent.\" And that was what it said of the first sentence because so few people are really engaged and care about the work that they do, that they're willing to go invest and investigate and figure out and solve and try stuff and fail and pick themselves up and try again, right? \n\nAnd this is true regardless of whether we're talking about our skills with people, with process, right? So those are those agile group of skills or product management or whatever it is. But it also includes the technical, right? In the detail, in the weeds, and how you actually do the work that you do every day that is irrelevant to the system with which we're working. And I think that is the fundamental difference between somebody who is average at doing their work and somebody who is great at doing the work: the willingness to learn, willingness to adapt, willingness to try things, investing your own time and making yourself better, right? \n\nUm, one of my favourite folk in the world, David Starr, who originally created the APS Applying Professional Scrum class back in the day, had this thing that he always said: \"What do martial artists and musicians have in common?\" Right? What do martial artists and musicians have in common? And they're so different that people are usually like, \"Well, I don't know, what do they have in common?\" They practice. \n\nWhen do we get practice? When do we come off actually performing, right, at the concert, making the production code? And when do we get the time to practice? When we get things to try, different things to try, new things? That's actually, for me, I feel like one of the powers of training classes—not maybe the PowerPoint training classes where you basically fall asleep and your brain dribbles out your ears watching a PowerPoint presentation—but what I try and do is bring in some of the ideas of flipped learning, right? So I provide you with effectively, \"Here's the content I'm going to teach you in day one,\" right? Go read it. \n\nIf you read it, I don't need to tell you it; we can then talk about it and practice it in the live session where we are together because everybody reads at a different pace, everybody learns at a different pace. Perhaps you could spend some time reading that content and then we're going to answer the questions, we're going to dive into the nuance, we're going to figure out how that works, we're going to do some exercises so that we can maybe practice some things. That's the value of all being together, not in reading some content off of a slide. \n\nSo I think that that learning, interest in learning, is what makes it really powerful. And I do have a customer that leverages this, um, and they actually provide their developers, everybody in their company, with a budget of about five thousand Euros a year for training. And you spend it how you like. It's up to you what training classes you want to book, what you want to learn. Perhaps you just want to go do an NLP class because you aren't very good at that stuff and you want to understand it better. Perhaps you do some cognitive behavioural therapy classes because that's what you feel you're lacking. You can pretty much do anything you want with that budget. I'm sure they might frown if you wanted to go on a paper airplane making class, but the idea is that you, as an individual, know what you don't know, right? You kind of know what you don't understand, you know what you need to figure out, and the person best suited to direct the learning that you need is yourself. \n\nIt also has the huge benefit that it's opt-in, right? It's self-service. So the worst type of learning is mandated and forced learning. People generally don't pay attention, don't care as much, and don't participate. But if they pick it themselves, they're generally more eager, more engaged. And that's the difference between the average developer and the great agile developer: engagement, practice, focus. That's what it is. \n\nThanks for watching the video. If you enjoyed it, please like, follow, and subscribe.

    "captions": "I'm going to configure release management to use a new Team Foundation server. So I'm going to go ahead and open the release management client. I'm going to head over to the administration tab, and on here I've got a manage TFS options. Let me go in there. \n\nSo you can see we already have the Faber cam fiber collection added. I'm going to add the Tail Spin Toys one. So if I click new, I can just put in the name of the server here, or I can put the full URL. You'll see that it kind of builds the URL down at the bottom; you can see at the top as well. I'm going to put the collection name in, which is Tail Spin Toys collection. \n\nAnd you'll see here I've got the default path and port number, and this is just all on the default setup, and it's local to this box, so I shouldn't have any communication issues. However, if I hit the verify button, you'll see I get a common error message box pops up, and this box gives you possible reasons for the communication problem. One is you filled it out correctly, or the TFS server is unavailable, and the other one is that the password is incorrect, which is the case here. \n\nI have no connect as account name and password in, so I need to go over here and I need to fill out my user. Let me just check name; there we go, and my password, and click verify. Now, if that still doesn't work and you don't get a green tick, you might want to check obvious things like the spelling of your server and collection name and whether you can access those things. \n\nThe easiest way to do that is to copy this URL, open it up in a browser, paste it in, and see if you can actually access it on that URL. Indeed, it can be much easier to get access to it than just copying it off, and I can make it easier. So now that we have that, I can hit save and close, and I now have two active TFS connections."

    "description": "Discover key red flags to watch for when hiring an agile consultant to ensure a successful transformation from traditional project management.",
    "captions": "So what a question was: what are the red flags to look for when hiring an agile consultant? I think the biggest red flags for me are not engaging in the community, not being part of some group or community or effort where they're sharing their ideas with others, having ideas of others shared with them, and working in that kind of melting pot. There's nothing better than being part of an agile community, which I'm part of a few, and seeing something and you immediately get piled on for saying something so ridiculous that it's not really people aren't deliberately piling on you, right? Because they're agile, it's just, you know, you send them a message and all of them are writing a response at the same time because you've poked at something that maybe wasn't the best thing to pull at. \n\nAnd that gives you, I don't know what the right word is, is it humility? For you're not always going to say the right thing, you're not always going to be able to do the right thing, you're going to say stupid stuff. And you have to be able to take being called on saying stupid stuff. Sometimes it's okay to say stupid stuff because if you don't say what you're thinking, if you don't feel safe enough to say what you're thinking, how would you possibly be able to learn that there might be a different way of thinking? \n\nI think that's one of the key things because there are so many consultants who are not part of any agile community. They just have that echo chamber of their organisation or their consultancy, and there's not anything more information coming in from outside. Having discourse, right? Being able to articulate the core concepts in agile. So I'm thinking empiricism, I'm thinking lean. You need to be able to articulate them in a way that they are able to be understood by the other person within the context of that other person rather than just regurgitating something from the scrum guide that says, \"Well, XYZ,\" right? \n\nYou need to be able to say, \"Well, you know, the scrum guide says this because it's trying to achieve this idea. If you can achieve this idea in a different way inside of your organisation, then maybe that's okay.\" Being able to articulate those things, I think that's key. So that's just a fundamental lack of knowledge, right? That's really it. I think it's actually true in all consultancies, but I'm going to be very specific here because otherwise I'm going to piss off everybody, right? \n\nThere's a difference between a boutique consultancy which specialises in a particular topic, hires people who are experts, known experts in that particular topic, and encourages them to become better experts in that particular topic, and our \"butts in seats\" contracting consultancy who are really only interested in how much money they can make out of the customer. They get into this vicious cycle, right? This is the thing to watch out for in consultancies as you get into this vicious cycle of, in order to stay afloat, we need to win more business, right? \n\nWe're the consultants who say we need to win more business because we've got people that are in the company that need the work. Then you have experts and you have all of these high ideals with the customer, so lots of customers buy your stuff, and suddenly you don't have enough people on the bench to service the gigs that are coming in, right? The gigs in your pipeline. So then you have to go find people who can do those gigs, but we can't wait for those people; we need them now. \n\nSo we're taking the people that are available, not the people that are right for that gig. They're not bringing in people because of their knowledge and skills; they're bringing in people because of their availability. And then you get into that vicious cycle of, now we've got more people, and they roll off a gig onto the bench, and we need to sell more to get more stuff rather than... I mean, it's even worse for an agile consultancy not to do this, but having a lean outlook, right? You don't take on more work than you can handle. You limit your work in process so that you're playing the long game, not the short game of revenue extraction, but the long game of value creation and building relationships with your customers and not pissing them off. \n\nSo for me, those are the two big pieces: the actual individuals and the knowledge and capability that they have to understand agile, articulate it, explain it, and work with it, and work with other people in the agile space, and that bigger consultancy model of the... I call it the death spiral, right? Because there's no way out of that if all you're focused on is, \"I need bots in revenue extraction mode.\" Then you're not going to serve your customers, right? For me, that's the two big things."
