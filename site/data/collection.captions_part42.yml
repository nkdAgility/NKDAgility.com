  title: 'The Power of Metrics: Why PAL-EBM is Essential for Your Organization'
  description: "Unlock organisational success with the PAL EBM course! Discover the power of evidence-based management and effective metrics in this insightful video. \U0001F31F"
  captions: I would recommend the PAL EBM class really to anybody who works in a company who wants to take it in a direction of success. So you could be a manager managing a team within your organisation, you could be managing a group of teams, you could be managing a whole product, or you could be CEO managing the whole company. You could be a product owner, you could be a Scrum Master, you could be a leader anywhere in leadership in the organisation. The PEBM class is designed to take the participants through a story that enables understanding. Right, that's how we as humans learn best, is to experience and tell stories and engage in some kind of activities. The PBM class is designed to take us through those ideas about effectively why our existing metrics that we collect aren't being successful. Right, what is it about them that's being unsuccessful? So not just this one's bad and this one's good, but what is the underlying reason, the people reason, why a lot of those metrics are unsuccessful? Connecting those dots and enabling the people in the group to really understand the impact of having good metrics. Almost every participant I've had that goes through the PAL EBM has had epiphany-like realisations about what they're not doing in their organisation that they really should be doing. Right, that they really should be looking at these metrics, they really should be iteratively looking at them over time, seeing the trend and direction, and using metrics to shape the direction of the organisation while watching out for negative behaviours caused in people by monitoring those metrics. Right, there's lots of great examples out there of poor metrics. We tell a lot of those stories in the class. Right, in the PBM class, the trainer tells a lot of the stories of organisations out there. A lot of that information is publicly available as well, that you can find those metrics that we've always used and the negative impact that they've had on organisations over the longer term. That's not really obvious in the short term, but you do something over five or ten years in your organisation, and it can be absolutely detrimental to the way that you do business. One of the stories that I always tell for leaders is Microsoft. Microsoft used to do stack ranking. If you Google stack ranking, you'll find a whole bunch of other organisations that have also never been successful using it, in fact, been wholly unsuccessful using it. But stack ranking was this idea that you, as a manager, every manager in the organisation stack ranks every one of their direct reports, and the bottom 10% is out of the team. Right, and if you're in the bottom 10% three times in a row, you're out of the company. One of the things that we engage with is how would something like that impact on the behaviours of the people within the organisation? Right, and it's so obvious in hindsight the negative impact of those types of metrics on behaviours of people that you want to be collaborating together towards a common goal. How would this impact them? It's blatantly obvious to us the negative impact of that, but then why was it policy within Microsoft and the engineering organisation for ten years? Right, why did they not change it sooner? It took Satya coming along to make that change, and it's because people cling onto their beliefs in spite of the data. The data is telling them it's not going well, and they cling to it. Part of PAL EBM is transparency. Right, we have an empirical system for monitoring our data, so we want to be able to really see what's going on, see the real data, and then make decisions based on what's really going on, not the general fiction that most business decisions are made on at the moment. So that's why I would recommend the PAL EBM. I would heartily recommend it for individuals, but I would even more recommend it for organisation leadership teams to go through together. I've done that a number of times with organisations, and one of the comments that I got from a CIO in the PBM was, "These are the conversations that we've never had time to have," right, that we should have had before. Now that we've all had that little warning bell going off, thinking we should have these conversations, and we've just not had them because we don't have time, we don't have the inclination, we don't feel like we can voice it. The class creates space for leadership teams to really have those deep conversations on how are they going to measure success, what does success even mean, and how are they going to iteratively strategise towards the desired outcome?

  title: 'Unlocking Agile’s Core: Questioning to Create Value'
  description: "Unlock the true potential of Agile! Discover how questioning and adaptability can transform your organisation and outpace competitors. Watch now! \U0001F31F"
  captions: |-
    There's a quote by Steve Denning: "Being agile is about questioning what you do and continuously improving what you're doing." And that really is that fundamental kernel of what's the difference between what people have always done and what agile is talking about. We'd like people to do going forward into the future. And that's that question everything you do: why you do it, value it.

    If it doesn't have value that it creates that's greater than the pain of doing it, then you need to change what it is you're doing and do things differently. And that is why we talk about, or at least Ken talks about, Scrum as a mirror. Right? I can't do Scrum because here's something you need to go fix in the way your organisation does business in order to become more effective. Because the more effective you are at adapting to change, the more chance you have of being successful in your market. The more chance you have of adapting around whatever it is the market throws at you, the world throws at you, or your competitors throw at you.

    And if you can change and adapt faster than your competitors can, you'll be the one setting the trend in the market. You'll be the one that they're following, and you'll be the one making the money first. Right? And that's ultimately what it's all about. The most capitalistic organisations are the ones that can change as quickly as possible to take advantage of market opportunities. Right? That's what it's all about.

    So, be that ninja, being able to dynamically change your business anytime you need. And for that, you can't do that. You can't make those decisions as a leader in an organisation or as a CEO. Right? You have to have the people that are at every level in your organisation need to be looking at the same thing. They need to be not following the rules; they need to be questioning the rules at every possible moment. They need to be asking, "Is there a better way to do this?" Right? That could be faster and quicker. Maybe we don't need to do this at all. Maybe we need to do it differently.

    Those are all the questions that we should be constantly asking and creating forums within our organisation so that you can have those things dealt with. There's no point in having all those questions asked and then doing nothing about them, because all you do is end up with a bunch of disgruntled people working in your organisation who can see all the things that need to be fixed, but they can't fix them. They don't have the authority to fix them, and nobody else has the authority to fix them. Right? Or nobody else wants to, or senior leadership doesn't care. Right? That's going to have a massively negative impact on your business.

    So, focus instead on creating forums within your organisation where you can have those legitimate moments—might be continuously—where you continuously look at and question the things that are going on, the way you do things, the choices that have been made, the decisions that have been made, so that you can continuously have the best possible version of your organisation emerge over time.

    If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.

  title: 'Transform Your Product Development: Unleash the Power of Experimentation and Collaboration'
  description: Unlock your product development potential! Discover strategies to enhance user value, reduce waste, and foster collaboration in our transformative PPDV course.
  captions: |-
    The course will definitely change your product development game. First point, you will be able to increase user value. Why? Because you are going to deliberately design experiments to better understand user needs and find effective ways how to address them. So we believe this is the best way to increase user value.

    Second point, because you will be able to increase user value and have this process more conscious with a lot of learning, you are definitely on your path to decrease waste. As a result, you will also improve return on investment when it comes to what the team is working on. You will invest based on evidence; you can adjust your budgeting based on experiments, based on the results, based on the data that you get. And at the end of the day, thanks to that, you can embrace the agility principle of simplicity. So in that process, you will also be maximising the amount of work that is creating little or no value.

    Another important point: we, as human beings, really often jump into solution space immediately or just by briefly presenting the problem. In this class, we want to unlock creativity by thinking in problems and showing a different perspective on that. So hold your horses and let's try different experiments to make sure that we truly understand what the problem is. You might be amazed how many different solutions may finally be created when we first pay a lot of attention to understanding the problem.

    Another point: some of the customers, some of the teams, companies complain when it comes to collaboration with stakeholders. With this class, you actually might be equipped with some tools and ideas on how to improve collaboration between the teams and between the stakeholders. This collaboration may change completely because if you invite others and show them this different perspective, your product development may start with using data, not opinions. In that case, it might also be easier for you to get a green light from important stakeholders, but also to show them that certain paths, certain ideas are not worth investing in.

    Finally, I believe it's also a class that is improving our toolbox, our product development toolbox. Because after the class, you will have a bunch of valuable practices, techniques, and ideas when it comes to discovery and validation, and you can start using them immediately after you leave the class. So it might be a great beginning of changes that you will start very soon, just after you say goodbye in our class.

  captions: You can't measure understanding. You just can't measure it. You can't say, "Here's a line in the sand," and at this point, everybody understands it. It's a lot more nebulous than that, a lot more fuzzy than that. So you, as a product owner, need to learn to read the room, to know what language you need to use in order to enable understanding, to know what sometimes people don't want to admit that they don't understand your thing. Right? So you need to learn to be able to read when people are in that category and maybe do some more around it.

  title: Making Business Decisions with Evidence! What is evidence-based management?
  description: Unlock the power of evidence-based management! Learn to make data-driven decisions and enhance your leadership for sustainable business growth.
  captions: |-
    What is evidence-based management? I think the easiest way to describe it is just bringing science and empiricism to leadership. All right, how do we make decisions as leaders? What's the data that we're using to inform our decisions? And when we make decisions, what is the impact that those decisions have on the organization, and how are we measuring that? 

    In most organizations that I see, a lot of that is done by either gut feeling, right? So there's not really any data, or there's a lot of vanity metrics in the organization. The metrics represent us looking good but don't necessarily change the way we do business. So evidence-based management is an attempt to address that and help organizations understand their business value. Right, that's the key thing there: the business value. Are we focused on delivering value to our stakeholders, our customers, and how are we measuring that value? 

    It really talks about two categories with four key value areas that we feel like is a good idea to measure. At the top, we've kind of got market value. Obviously, that's key, right? If we don't have any market value, we're not going to be a sustainable business. The two sides to that are value we already have, our current value, so that's in our products and our services and things that our business does right now. The other side of that is unrealised value, right? What's the value we've got left sitting on the table? Markets we haven't explored, new opportunities, new things that we haven't pursued, new customers we haven't got yet. 

    So trying to understand those two, and although evidence-based management comes with a set of, I guess you could call them example metrics in each of these key value areas, the reality is that you need to find the metrics that make the most sense for your organization within those contexts. I just like to see us having metrics in each of the key value areas. 

    So we were talking about market value, so current value and unrealised value, but there's also our capability as an organization, our ability to actually do stuff, right? The top two are about doing the right thing. Are we moving in the right direction? Are we focused on filling those gaps, perhaps in our market capability? The bottom half is our organisational capability, so that kind of sits in two key value areas. 

    So it's four total, and that's time to market, which is how fast we can go from idea to market, getting stuff in front of the customers to test our assumptions, right? Because we assume that something is going to provide value, but until we actually get it in front of customers, we're not really sure. We just have an assumption, and we want to test it. The other side is the ability to innovate, right? How much time do we spend delivering new stuff, and what are the things that impact our ability to spend time delivering new stuff? 

    I think those four together, if we as a business have a core understanding of our current value, our unrealised value, our ability to innovate, and our time to market, that gives us a holistic view of our ability to deliver business value. Then once we've decided on what those metrics are and we're able to monitor our organization, maybe you only do that quarterly, right? Collecting this large set of metrics, we're then able to see how the decisions that we make, the changes that we make to our organization, actually impact on those metrics that we've decided to look at. 

    So that is what evidence-based management is. We're going to use evidence to manage our organization, right? This is something that a manager would use, depending on whatever you're at the top of, the pyramid for, right? It could be a product, it could be a service, it could be a whole organization, a whole company. How are you measuring these things, and how do you use that data to inform the decisions that you make? 

    Evidence-based management is just bringing that story together and saying, yes, we have metrics, yes, we're looking at them, we're monitoring them in a regular cadence, and we're making different decisions based on those metrics and seeing how that shapes the direction that we end up going. 

    And that's because this is something that so many organizations don't do. You would believe the number of organizations that I go into, and they have no goals, they have no strategy, and they have no way to measure it. This can be a competitive advantage, right? If you're able to leverage empirical, hypothesis-driven, data-based decisions to shape the direction of your organization to the market and the market niches that you are able to find, that can be the competitive advantage that you need to be successful. 

    If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.

  title: Why is Kanban becoming increasingly popular in creative industries?
  description: Explore why Kanban is gaining traction in creative industries! Discover its adaptability, core principles, and how it enhances workflow efficiency.
  captions: |-
    I think Caman is becoming popular in the creative industries because there's very little other help out there for the creative type work where you're, for example, building computer games or you're building marketing content or you're building videos. Whatever it is that you're building, that's not really software engineering, because everybody thinks of Scrum as a software engineering process and find it a little bit weird trying to apply it within their context. Right? They actually, they're actually running into the same thing that everybody runs into, that doesn't, that would, things don't work that way here. So Caman is a much better starting point for getting into making changes to the way that you work and trying to optimise your processes.

    So coming up with that definition of workflow for your existing process is usually much easier than trying to apply something like Scrum. So for lots of organisations, they don't want that big bang change. Right? When you apply something like Scrum, you're making a leap from the way you currently work and changing it to something else, and this is going to be your starting point. So that would be you start at Scrum and then you're going to move forward from there and optimise. You're still going to use Cban Caman strategy and you're going to optimise from there. But if your way of working right now is kind of working and you don't want to disrupt that too much or you don't feel you don't know if you're going to get value from that Scrum thing, then start from where you are. Right? That's the beauty of a Caman strategy is it doesn't care what the, it doesn't care the way your system currently works. You model your existing system, that's where you start from.

    So you can take any industry, any system, creative or otherwise, and you can just model your existing system. A huge difficulty though, I've worked in quite a few creative, I've worked in the creative industry. Right? When I first started as a software engineer after I graduated back in 2000, my first jobs were New Media agencies. You probably wouldn't call them that anymore, but New Media agencies. I worked with groups of designers building Flash applications, Flash websites, if anybody remembers Flash. If not, don't even look at it, it's mental. And those kind of things, working with the creative industry, it's a very difficult space because of the way art works. Right? It's very difficult to be iterative and incremental right away in that space because the way we traditionally work with art is it's your personal thing, and your personal thing is going to a certain point till you're personally happy with it, and then you're providing it to other people to give you feedback and that kind of thing.

    So there's a much more personal nature to that than there is in maybe other industries like software engineering, right? Where there's less, a little bit less personal. It can still be personal, but a little bit less personal. So that's why creative industries and creative folks struggle with something like Scrum, because it talks about team, it doesn't talk about individual, and creativity is about the individual. So finding the balance in that is very standoffish. So Caman strategy, but the hardest part of a Caman strategy, at least at the beginning, is writing down your workflow. Right? Documenting your definition of workflow. How are you going to get five creative people in a room and agree what your existing workflow is? So that's going to be your first struggle. But Caman is popular in creative industries because it seems like actually, I'm actually going to recant some of that a little bit. I think that Caman is popular in a lot of places where people don't want to change, and they see Scrum has a bunch of rules, and Caman doesn't have a bunch of rules, and they feel like they can just put a board on the wall, call it Caman, and they're done.

    That's not Caman. Having a board on the wall and moving cards across it is one very small part of Caman, maybe an important part, that visualisation part. But have you taken the time to actually define your workflow? To agree as a group, all the people working together, that this is how we are all going to act, how we're all going to make decisions in the same way? I doubt that happens in most organisations. Have you agreed what the working process limits are? How much work is going to sit in each column? If you don't have WIP limits, you ain't got Cban at all. Right? So sitting down and agreeing that this is really hard stuff. It's hard for a group of people to get together and make these decisions and come up with these rationales. It's just hard. I do workshops with groups of people talking about this stuff, and you can do a four-hour workshop with a group of five or six people and not get anywhere near a definition of workflow. Nowhere near. And this is people who largely agree on what it is they're doing, because the devil's in the details. Right? When you've got a bunch of work in a pile and you need to start a new piece of work, how do you choose that piece of work?

    How do you choose it? Right? We have to agree as a group how we're going to choose it, because this is our system that we're all working within. So how, whose way of choosing it do we pick? Right? Out of the five different opinions on how they select work. Well, I like this type of work, so I'm going to take that. No, that's not good enough. That's not how you optimise a system. Right? That's not how you optimise the flow of work through a system. What is the most valuable piece of work to take next? Now that's an interesting conversation. And how do you define value? And does it matter whether you as an individual are comfortable with that piece of work or not? Right? There's probably some yes, some no, right? Within the bounds of that. So making these agreements and writing them down is very hard. And although Caman has become popular, particularly in the creative industry, I definitely feel there's a lot of "Can't Ban," right? That they really don't want to do anything or change anything or have anything imposed upon them and their way of working.

    I know a lot of creatives, creatives are very much, very much, "My way of working is the best for me. That's how my muse." Right? And that's absolutely reasonable. But we're all working together within a business driving a particular outcome, and that business needs to optimise the work in order to maximise the return on investment. Right? So how much effort we spend versus how much money we get. And yeah, we need some level of standardisation, and a core critical part of Caman is defining that standardisation. Have personal Caman. If you don't want to work together as a team, each individual has their own Cban. Problem solved. Right? Everybody just decides their own way of working, their own workflow, as long as they define it, they write it down, they have the visualisation, limit their work in process. Personal Caman. There's a book on personal Caman, and I highly recommend that as well.

    So I know Caman's getting popular, but please do look at the Cang guides. Right? Take a look at the Cang guides, look at what is actually involved in creating a Caman or using a Caman strategy against your work. And usually, there's more rigor, more effort, more ambiguity, and more difficulty than something like Scrum. If your current system of work is failing you, then you would benefit from creating and applying a Caman strategy. Our professional Caman trainers and consultants are ready to help. Don't wait. The sooner you get started, the sooner you will improve. Get in touch below.

  title: Estimating with Confidence
  description: Unlock reliable software project estimates with Martin Hinshelwood! Discover the power of probabilistic forecasting for confident, accurate planning.
  captions: |-
    One of the big struggles within the context of software projects is estimation. Most organizations try and do some form of estimation. Either they're using absolute estimation, so we're talking errors here, or they're using some kind of relative estimation tool. It's really difficult because we feel like we need estimates to understand what we're going to do. We actually don't. 

    But what we do need is the ability to forecast out into the future with some kind of probability. Right? So when we're talking about software delivery, where we have really high variance, it's still really difficult. There is no tool when you have more than 50% unknown that you can use to accurately predict the future. Right? Accuracy is not a thing you can have. 

    So what's the best we can get? Right? We want to be looking at probabilities and probabilistic forecasting. So what we tend to do is use some kind of forecasting simulation tool to look forward into the future based on what actually happened. So we're never actually effectively estimating an individual item within our backlog. We're just saying that we can deliver, let's say, in the next 30 days, we'll deliver another 50 items with an 85% likelihood that that's going to happen. 

    That leaves wiggle room for things not happening the way you think, and it doesn't require the people on your teams to spend a significant amount of time estimating. It doesn't require any actual numbers to come out of the team. It still requires the people doing the work to analyse the work and break it down into smaller chunks. Right? That's reducing the batch size of each individual item. That is still required. That is something you want to spend time on because it builds understanding within the context of what it is that we're delivering. 

    Right? We want to understand the thing we're delivering, and that understanding is the main impactor of our ability to execute on those things. So in this new world, there isn't really estimation, but we still have confidence, and we put an actual probability on our confidence. I usually encourage teams and departments and organizations to look at about an 85% confidence level, being that what 70% of all startups fail. So it probably relates a little bit to 70% of all ideas are going to be unsuccessful. 

    Right? So what's your confidence level of being able to deliver? As long as it's higher than 70%, it's probably a good bet, and we can figure it out from there.

  title: Overview of 'applying flow metrics for Scrum' course.
  description: Unlock Scrum's potential with Kanban! Discover how flow metrics can enhance planning, execution, and retrospectives for better team performance.
  captions: |-
    So the applying flow metrics for Scrum course is an amazing class about Kanban from the proamband.org about how you would leverage the metrics and capabilities that a Kanban strategy brings within the context of a Scrum team. We're going to be talking about how to leverage the different data aspects in Sprint planning, in Daily Scrum, especially the other events, retrospective, what tools you can use around product backlog refinement to help you increase flow, how you track progress towards critical dates and deliverables, and to identify opportunities for the team to ask more interesting questions. 

    And that's the purpose of the applying flow metrics with Scrum course. It exists mainly because there are lots of people who are doing Scrum in their organisations and they're really struggling to deliver value at the end of each Sprint, to focus on that value delivery. A Kanban strategy enables you to focus on and increase the flow of value delivery through your system. 

    So it really, really, really benefits Scrum teams. I wouldn't want to be doing Scrum without this capability. It really helps teams deliver on that value, right? And it's really core focus on delivering value, not tasks, but actual value to the customers. 

    So you should be able to increase your ability to deliver, make your stakeholders happier, and your business happier using these techniques.
