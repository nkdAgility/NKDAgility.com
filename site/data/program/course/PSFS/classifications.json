Scrum Values are mentioned in relation to facilitation, but there is no substantive analysis of foundational beliefs or system-level ethos, nor discussion of how ethos is evidenced in outcomes or how it sustains transformation. The emphasis is on techniques and surface-level principles rather than the core, demonstrable convictions highlighted in the Ethos category. The audience (experienced practitioners) only partially overlaps. The content is relevant and focused but does not address Ethos as a primary concern.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course prioritizes practical facilitation and Scrum values, with little focus on system-level ethos or foundational convictions. While relevant to practitioners, it aligns weakly with the Ethos category due to limited exploration of underlying beliefs or systemic evidence.",

Course learning outcomes, audience, and topics are aimed at improving team-level collaboration, not strategies for scaling Agile. There are no references to scaling frameworks, methods for cross-team interaction, or managing dependencies across teams. While the audience could overlap with those interested in scaling, the material is unrelated to the unique challenges and methodologies involved in scaling Agile beyond a single team context. Signal-to-noise is low for the Scaling category, as content remains squarely in team-level facilitation.",
