'Portfolio Kanban board' is repeatedly mentioned, and learning outcomes specify defining and operating these boards. However, the discussion is broad, focusing more on principles, alignment, process, and management than on the formal structure, transparency, and inspection properties of artifacts in depth. There is peripheral relevance where Kanban boards serve as artifacts, but the main narrative is on practices and organizational impact rather than a deep exploration of artifact structure or types (as per Scrum/Agile artifact classification). The fit is partial, with explicit artifact references and usage, but lacking comprehensive artifact-focused analysis.",
