Therefore, the content does not align with the Beta Codex category.",

While Scrum and Agile can be related to Lean, the content neither references Lean principles, tools, nor core Lean themes. Any alignment is highly indirect (general process improvement), and there is no substantive discussion of Lean or its concepts. As a consequence, all scores are very low, and the overall fit with the Lean Thinking category is minimal.",
