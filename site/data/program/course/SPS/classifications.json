There are no explicit mentions or sustained discussion of ethos, foundational beliefs, or how values are demonstrated through system behavior—topics required for this category.

The content focuses on team coordination, dependency management, and productivity within a scaled agile environment, but only lightly touches on autonomy (optimizing team productivity, organizing work). The core themes revolve around practical project and team structure rather than the deliberate engineering of agency or AI-augmented practices.
