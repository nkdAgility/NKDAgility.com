The alignment is tangential at best, as the material is aimed at Product Owners generally rather than optimizing Time to Market specifically. The audience (agile practitioners, product leaders) is appropriate, and some concepts—innovation, experimentation—could contribute indirectly to reducing Time to Market, but the main purpose and discussion seldom address it directly.
