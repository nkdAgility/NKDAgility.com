Only a tangential connection exists via agile practices, but without linking these to the design or management of a broader product operating model.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on agile engineering and ALM practices, with no substantive discussion of the Industrial Operating Model (IOM). There are no direct mentions of IOM, its mechanics, or core assumptions. The content does not explain IOM, its origins, effectiveness, or organizational structure; instead, it targets modern software practitioners interested in agile methods. It also does not contrast these practices with IOM or situate them within the industrial paradigm. Any overlap (e.g., possible legacy ALM tools) is too tangential for a strong fit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about agile engineering and ALM practices, not the Industrial Operating Model. No alignment with IOM's structure, assumptions, or mechanics. Does not help readers understand what IOM is or where it works. Fit is minimal to none.",
