The fit is tangential at best: the content might help teams become more effective, which could indirectly impact value realisation, but this link is not explicit and not explored. The audience (Scrum practitioners and newcomers) could, in theory, benefit from learning about Unrealised Value, but the course as described does not cover this topic specifically or by intention.

The signal-to-noise ratio and audience alignment are moderately high since the audience could be interested in workflow concepts, but the core learning objectives, topics, and outcomes are focused on Scrum fundamentals.

There are no explicit mentions of 'ethos,' or direct discussions of how core beliefs drive system behavior or delivery outcomes. The coverage of values is abstract and not linked to observable system-level convictions or behaviors as described in the Ethos definition.

Target audience is comprised of individuals or single teams aiming to understand or adopt Scrum practices, not organizations looking to scale.
