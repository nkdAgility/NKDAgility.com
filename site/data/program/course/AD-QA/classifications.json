The entire course focuses on practical test management, execution, and quality assurance skills in Azure Test Plans, without reference to identifying or measuring untapped value, innovation potential, or opportunity backlogs. The audience (agile teams, managers, Scrum Masters) could overlap with EBM interest, but the content's signal is quality assurance, not value strategy. The intent, alignment, and depth scores remain low due to absence of relevant theoretical or practical discussion about Unrealised Value.",

Direct mentions of 'Definition of Workflow' or related Kanban/agile workflow agreements are absent; content centers around test case management, planning, and reporting. Although terms like 'planning' and 'sprints' are present, they do not anchor to an explicit or conceptual discussion of workflow policies, WIP limits, entry/exit criteria, or making flow explicit as per Kanban. The audience aligns with the broader agile demographic, but there is minimal content specifically about Definition of Workflow. No outdated or contradictory approaches are referenced, so no penalties are required.",

While it names participants (Scrum Masters, coaches) typical of an ethos-oriented context, it makes no attempt to discuss system-level beliefs, disciplined stances, or behavioral evidence central to ethos. The content does not discuss core values, system behaviors driven by ethos, or make any distinction between ritual and real conviction. Depth, alignment, mentions and intent are all very weak, as it's instructional and tool/process focused. Audience is slightly higher since the named audience could overlap with those interested in ethos, but all other dimensions are almost absent.",
