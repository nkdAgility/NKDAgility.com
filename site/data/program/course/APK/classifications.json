    "reasoning": "The course description explicitly lists 'workflow design' and 'visualization' as teaching topics, emphasizing practical mastery of Kanban principles. Learning outcomes include workflow creation, operation, WIP limits, visual boards, and continuous improvement—closely aligned with the Definition of Workflow. However, the explicit term 'Definition of Workflow' is not directly named, and the coverage, while thorough, is embedded among broader Kanban system content rather than exclusively focusing on the definition aspect. Audience and intent fit well, targeting practitioners seeking to make workflows explicit, and the signal is fairly strong but somewhat shared with adjacent topics (e.g., flow metrics, tooling). No explicit penalties apply.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course closely aligns with the Definition of Workflow category through its focus on workflow design, WIP limits, visualization, and continuous improvement in a Kanban context. While the explicit term is not directly used, the main themes and learning outcomes strongly support the classification.",

There is little or no explicit reference to foundational beliefs, underlying convictions, or system-level ethos. The emphasis is on practices, tools, and direct application, with the only indirect alignment being the mention of principles and value delivery, which are addressed as content topics but not explored deeply. Audience fit is moderate given the roles listed, but the primary purpose is skill certification rather than examination of ethos. No penalties are applied, as the tone and information are appropriate, and there are no outdated elements.",

There is no explicit mention of scaling frameworks (SAFe, LeSS, Nexus), cross-team coordination, managing dependencies across multiple teams, or enterprise-wide flow. The audience includes those who might later work with scaling, but the primary material centers on individual and team-level Kanban practices without addressing scaling complexities or strategies defined for the category. Thus, the confidence is low, reflecting little direct categorization under 'Scaling.'",

The material is practical, tool- and process-focused, and intended for practitioners aiming to improve delivery, but lacks the philosophical and engineering framing intrinsic to Agentic Engineering. While kanban practices have some conceptual overlap—like empowering team-level improvement—the content does not delve into agency, ethical AI, or decentralised decision frameworks, providing only indirect, surface-level adjacency at best.",

There are no explicit or implicit mentions of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or integration of AI with human expertise. The curriculum is grounded in traditional Kanban and Lean/Agile concepts with emphasis on human team practices, workflow design, and tooling—none of which are specifically agentic or AI-driven. The intent is educational, targeting improvement in team delivery using Kanban rather than explicating or enabling agentic delivery models. Minimal possible alignment exists only in the broad theme of improving software delivery, not in the specific, proactive, and context-aware sense required. The audience is similar in being technical/practitioner, but the course content has negligible conceptual overlap with agentic software delivery.",
