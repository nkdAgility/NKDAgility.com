    "reasoning": "Transparency is not directly mentioned in this mentoring program's content. The emphasis is on Agile, DevOps, collaboration, and communication, with indirect alignment to topics like team dynamics and evidence-based practices that support transparency. However, transparency is not explored in depth or as a primary focus. Course topics such as 'Scrum Framework and Team Dynamics' or 'Evidence-Based Management' may imply transparency but never address it directly or comprehensively. The target audience is relevant and the program is focused, but the overall fit with the Transparency category is moderate and mostly incidental.",

    "reasoning": "The content describes a mentorship program focused on Agile, DevOps, Kanban, and evidence-based management—foundational engineering practices, not agentic software delivery. There are no explicit or implicit references to autonomous AI agents, agentic integration, contextual intelligence, or agency in delivery. The learning outcomes and course topics are centered on human-led methodologies, team practices, and established frameworks (Scrum, Kanban, DevOps). The audience aligns in being technical practitioners, but there is no overlap with the core themes of proactive, autonomous, or agent-augmented delivery strategies. Thus, the fit is very low on every dimension.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on traditional Agile, DevOps, and leadership mentoring, with no reference to agentic AI, agency, or context-aware systems. There is minimal to no conceptual or thematic overlap with Agentic Software Delivery. Fit is very low.",
