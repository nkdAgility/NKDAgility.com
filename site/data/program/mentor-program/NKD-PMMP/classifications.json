There are no direct, repeated mentions of 'product operating model', and the main purpose is skill development/certification, not operating model frameworks. Some topical overlap exists (e.g., continuous improvement, scaling Agile, stakeholder management), but coverage is not sufficiently deep or explicit on the actual operating model itself; the focus is on individual and team-level competence, not organization-level structure, governance, or model design. The fit is partial; the content is relevant for people operating within a product operating model, but does not substantively address the model's structure or continuous evolution per se.",
