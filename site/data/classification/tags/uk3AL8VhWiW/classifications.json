While it touches on workflow optimization and empirical decision-making, these ideas are rooted in traditional process management and do not introduce modern agentic themes. The audience is likely practitioners or managers interested in delivery metrics, but none of the context, technologies, or governance frameworks defining Agentic Software Delivery are addressed.",

While these are relevant to product operating models, there is no direct mention or explicit exploration of the design, governance, or organizational structures central to the category.

While it touches on optimisation, workflow, and systemic approaches, it does not make direct references to operating model design, structure, governance, or organization-wide transformation. There are no explicit mentions of 'operating model' or its key components/variants, and the discussion remains centered on a single metric rather than the broader organizational context or change. The target audience seems to be teams and practitioners rather than executive or strategy-level decision-makers. Thus, the fit with the 'Operating Model' category is only partial and indirect, mostly through secondary alignment with workflow optimization and value delivery.",
