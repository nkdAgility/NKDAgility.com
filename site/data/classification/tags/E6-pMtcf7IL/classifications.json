Direct, explicit mentions of customer feedback loops are minimal, and methods or systematic practices for integrating feedback are not thoroughly detailed, which affects direct mentions and depth. The audience addressed (teams focused on value delivery, adaptability, and evidence-based decision-making) aligns with those seeking to implement feedback loops, and most of the content is relevant to customer-centric evaluation, leading to high scores in audience and signal.

    "reasoning": "The content centers on 'Current Value' within Evidence-Based Management, discussing measures for real-time value delivered by a product or service. While it touches on outcome-based measurement and continuous improvement—concepts present in OKRs—it never mentions or deeply aligns with OKR theory, terminology, or implementation. There is no discussion of Objectives, Key Results, John Doerr’s works, or the four OKR superpowers. The primary intent is informing about value measurement, not OKRs. The audience is organizational and product-focused, which partially overlaps with the OKR audience, but the core substance and terminology remain distinct. Signal is moderate since the focus and structure are clear, but relevance to OKRs is low.",
