Conceptual Alignment (7.4): The text highlights collaboration, value delivery, adaptability, continuous improvement, and a culture shift—core Agile philosophical values. However, it does not directly frame them as such, and always relates them back to ATDD specifically, not the Agile philosophy as a whole. Depth of Discussion (6.7): The discussion of ATDD is moderately deep, touching on cultural shifts and long-term organizational benefits, not just technique. However, it does not substantially explore or compare the larger Agile mindset. Intent/Purpose Fit (6.3): The content aims to inform and persuade about ATDD. While it relates to Agile's philosophical underpinnings (collaboration, shared responsibility, adaptability), its primary purpose is to advocate for ATDD, not to discuss Agile Philosophy broadly. Audience Alignment (6.6): The target audience (practitioners interested in ATDD) overlaps with some Agile Philosophy audiences, but is somewhat more tactical than strategic or philosophical. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (7.2): The content is focused and relevant to development process improvement, but not to Agile Philosophy as a category per se. There is little filler, but also little focus on the 'philosophy' as a distinct theme. No penalties were applied since the content is neither outdated nor negative in tone. Overall, while ATDD embodies several Agile principles, the discussion centers on a specific practice and its benefits, referencing Agile philosophy tangentially but not as the core subject.

The term 'automated testing' is not directly mentioned and the descriptions remain somewhat generic (mentions: 2.1). While depth is moderate (6.5)—it discusses ATDD's process and benefits, it doesn't elaborate on the technical implementation, tools, or specific automation strategies, so it does not cover key technical details emphasized in the classification definition.

    "reasoning": "The content is squarely focused on 'Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)' as a software development practice. \n\n1. Direct Mentions (1.8/10): The content never explicitly references 'organisational change', change management frameworks, or related terms. Its closest alignment is indirectly referencing agility or continuous improvement, but no direct mentions of the category or its canonical phrases.  \n\n2. Conceptual Alignment (5.6/10): There are some touchpoints: the content briefly discusses how consistent application of ATDD could 'enhance agility', 'adapt to changing requirements', and 'foster a culture of collaboration'. However, these aspects are tied to the development process, not to broader organisational transformation or structured change management initiatives. \n\n3. Depth of Discussion (5.4/10): The discussion of agility, collaboration, and adaptation is secondary to the primary explanation of ATDD as a technical and collaborative practice. There is some depth in describing its impact on teams and value delivery, but not enough on organisational-level transformation, frameworks, or leadership. \n\n4. Intent / Purpose Fit (4.9/10): The main intent is to inform about ATDD as a best practice for software teams, rather than to guide or discuss organisational change strategies or initiatives. Any links to organisational change are implied or secondary, not primary.\n\n5. Audience Alignment (6.4/10): The target audience seems to be technical practitioners—developers, testers, teams—though there are references to product owners and 'organisations'. It's not written for organisational leaders, strategists, or change managers, but mentions of business needs and long-term value slightly extend its relevance. \n\n6. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (7.1/10): The content is focused and consistent but entirely about ATDD. There’s minimal off-topic material, but as most of it is not 'noise' but just not highly relevant to organisational change, this is scored fairly high.\n\nOverall, the content is best described as 'tertiary' to the Organisational Change category—it contains tangential references to agility and adaptation but is primarily about a technical process. There were no penalties applied for outdatedness or negative tone. The confidence score reflects the predominance of technically-focused material with only hints at broader organisational change themes.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses ATDD as a collaborative human process, highlighting shared understanding and cross-role teamwork among stakeholders. However, there is no mention or discussion of human-AI partnerships, AI agents, or the emergence of human and AI collective capability. All focus is on human-driven collaboration, not on the enhancement or partnership with AI as specified in the Collective Intelligence definition. Therefore, while collaboration is strong, it is unrelated to human-AI collective intelligence.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on human team collaboration and shared understanding in acceptance criteria, but does not cover human-AI partnerships or collective intelligence as defined for this category. It is not a meaningful fit for 'Collective Intelligence'.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). It discusses collaboration, testability, business alignment, and agility, but makes no direct or indirect mention of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or intelligence-embedded systems. There is no discussion of contextual intelligence, agent-human integration, or any topic uniquely associated with 'Agentic Software Delivery.' While some themes around continuous improvement and shift-left overlap with modern delivery practices, the material remains anchored in traditional collaborative methodologies. The audience is still developers and teams, partially aligning with agentic delivery's audience, and the content is focused and relevant for ATDD itself, but not this category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about ATDD and does not mention agentic software delivery, autonomous agents, or AI integration. Its themes loosely overlap with modern delivery but not with this category. Fit is partial, incidental, and largely irrelevant.",
