The intent is primarily to increase understanding of IOM, not Agile philosophy; the target audience (leaders considering transformation) partly overlaps, but the topic is not directly focused on Agile Values and Principles. The potential for relevance (e.g., readers recognizing why a shift to Agile might be needed) is indirect and not explored in depth.
