short_title: Solving Real Problems
description: Move from tool-centric thinking to problem-focused strategy. Understand what improves when organisations start with real problems rather than solutions, enabling better decisions, clearer priorities, and sustainable outcomes.
tldr: Focusing on real problems leads to better decisions, clearer priorities, and sustainable outcomes. Teams that start with problem identification rather than tool selection report higher success rates and stronger stakeholder confidence. Encourage your team to prioritise problem discovery and validation before committing to solutions.

      title: Solving Real Problems
      subtitle: From Tool Obsession to Problem Clarity
      content: |
        Chasing technology trends without clear problems to solve. Investing in solutions before understanding what needs to improve. Teams busy building things that don't address real business challenges.

        Research shows 95% of generative AI pilots fail, not because the technology isn't powerful, but because organisations skip the hard work of defining the problem. The same pattern appears with DevOps, Scrum, Agile, OKRs, any tool-centric approach that starts with the solution rather than the problem.

    title: What Changes
    sideContent: |
      Tool obsession becomes problem clarity. Scattered efforts become aligned action. Technology-first thinking becomes outcome-focused strategy.

      The capability to solve real problems already exists in your organisation. What's often missing is the discipline to identify and articulate problems before racing toward solutions.

      Teams stop asking "What tool should we use?" and start asking "What problem are we solving?"

      This isn't about guarantees. It's the condition that emerges when problem identification becomes a discipline, not an afterthought.
