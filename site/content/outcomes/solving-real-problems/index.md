      title: Problem Before Solution
      subtitle: Why 95% of AI Pilots Fail—And How to Avoid That Fate
      content: |
        Research suggests that **95% of generative AI pilot projects fail** because teams jump straight to technology without first solving real problems. This isn't just an AI issue—it's the danger of any tool-centric approach. <a href="https://nkdagility.com/resources/guides/kendall-guide">The Kendall Guide</a> teaches that successful adoption begins with clearly defined problems, emphasising principles like "Problem before solution," "Context creates meaning," and "Collaboration sustains value."

      **NKD Agility applies the Kendall Guide's problem-first approach to help organisations avoid the pitfalls of technology-driven initiatives.** Our <a href="https://nkdagility.com/capabilities/ai-opportunity-discovery">AI Opportunity Discovery & Context Sourcing</a> service reinforces these principles by focusing on a problem-first mindset and structured, team-driven prioritisation—ensuring that technology serves your business needs, not the other way around.
