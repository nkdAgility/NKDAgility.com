short_title: Economic Returns
description: Maximize the business value and economic returns from your engineering investments through evidence-based practices, flow optimization, and strategic technical leadership.
tldr: Economic returns from engineering improve when organizations focus on flow, reduce waste, and connect engineering decisions to business outcomes. Teams that measure cycle time, reduce rework, and deliver predictably generate better ROI. Development managers should establish metrics that show the business impact of engineering excellence.

      title: Economic Returns from Engineering
      subtitle: Transform Engineering Costs into Strategic Value
