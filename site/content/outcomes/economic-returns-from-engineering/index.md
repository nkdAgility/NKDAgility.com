      title: Economic Returns from Engineering
      subtitle: Transform Engineering from Cost Center to Competitive Advantage
      content: |
        Your engineering budget keeps growing, but delivery speed isn't keeping pace. You're spending millions on talent and tools—yet can't show the board clear ROI.

        **The opportunity:** DORA research shows elite engineering organizations deploy 208x more frequently and recover 2,604x faster than low performers. That's not incremental improvement—that's competitive advantage.

      **Because engineering investments should compound, not drain.**

      **Why engineering leaders trust us:** We're not business consultants trying to understand code. We're engineers who've built production systems, led DevOps transformations, and presented ROI to boards. We speak both languages fluently.

      **Our guarantee:** Timeboxed engagement with full refund if you're not satisfied. No hourly billing, no scope creep, no change orders—just measurable outcomes.

      Led by Microsoft MVP Martin Hinshelwood, combining 20+ years of technical depth with flow economics and evidence-based management.
