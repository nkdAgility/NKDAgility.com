      title: Technical Leadership
      subtitle: From Firefighting to Strategic Direction
      content: |
        Technical direction buried under operational chaos. Engineering capability invisible to the business. Strategy disconnected from execution.

        The condition you need: technical leadership that connects engineering excellence to strategic direction. Clear visibility into delivery. Confident decision-making. The ability to innovate whilst maintaining stability.

    title: What Better Technical Leadership Looks Like
    content: |
      DORA research shows elite engineering organisations deploy 208× more frequently and recover from incidents 2,604× faster than low performers. Technical leadership creates the conditions for that performance.

      We've helped organisations like [SLB consolidate 800+ teams](/resources/case-studies/standardize-engineering-practice-across-800-teams/) and [streamline build processes across 90 teams in 13 countries](/resources/case-studies/streamline-build-and-release-across-90-teams-and-13-countries/), creating the visibility and alignment that technical leadership requires.

      **Technical leadership requires both engineering depth and strategic thinking.**

      We're not business consultants trying to understand code. We're engineers who've built production systems, led DevOps transformations, and presented technical strategy to boards. We speak both languages.

      Timeboxed retainer engagement with full refund if you're not satisfied. No hourly billing, no scope creep, no change orders. Just measurable outcomes and strategic clarity.

      Led by Microsoft MVP Martin Hinshelwood, combining 20+ years of technical depth with flow economics and evidence-based management.
