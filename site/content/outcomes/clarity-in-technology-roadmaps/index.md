        icon: fa-compass-question
        content: |
          You make architectural decisions but can't defend them. Stakeholders question everything. You've lost credibility.

        content: |
          You can't plan beyond next quarter because this quarter keeps changing direction. Strategic thinking is impossible.
      - title: Incoherent System Growth
        icon: fa-puzzle-piece
        content: |
          Every new system creates three integration problems. Technical debt grows faster than you can address it. Complexity becomes unmanageable.
      - title: Misalignment Across Departments
        icon: fa-chart-line-down
        content: |
          Product, engineering, and business speak different languages. Movement feels like friction. Progress stalls.
      - title: Eroded Decision Authority
        icon: fa-circle-question
        content: |
          Without clarity, your technical leadership loses authority. Stakeholders bypass you. Your influence diminishes.

      "Martin cuts to the chase with whatever you throw at him. Having worked with him extensively over the last 3 years, I can strongly recommend Martin whether your needs are broadly across the Software Application Lifecycle Development spectrum (including scrum training) or deeply into the most complex enterprise wide Team Foundation Server / Visual Studio Team Services migrations. This is a fast moving field in which Martin typically provides rapid responses and solutions, or facilitates them through his worldwide network. More than happy to talk with anyone needing further encouragement to engage in his services!"
