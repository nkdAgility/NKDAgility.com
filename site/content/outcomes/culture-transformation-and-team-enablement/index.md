        But without cultural alignment, delivery still stalls - and teams stay disengaged.

      "Martin did Scrum training for Backcountry through Scrum.org for three days and I must say it was very useful three days for us. The whole team of about 50+ people thoroughly enjoyed the training and got a lot out of it. In addition to great material and exercises Martin had a great style of delivery and won the respect of everyone including our engineers, which is a big deal. In addition to the in-class effort, Martin was also very forthcoming in helping folks outside class and still communicates with members of the team via e-mail. Great guy, very knowledgeable & great trainer. Highly recommend him."
