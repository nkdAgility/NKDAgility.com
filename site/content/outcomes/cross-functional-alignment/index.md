      "After a thorough evaluation ... we selected Martin because I felt he brings a perspective that’s very close to what I call the maker engineer - those who are deep in the code and often considered troublemakers in traditional structures. He brings a pragmatic point of view that really connects with the people building the product."

    title: What becomes possible
    leftContent: |
      ### Operational confidence

      Forecasts gain credibility as teams understand constraints and dependencies. Surprises decrease. Delivery becomes more predictable without micromanagement.

      ### Strategic agility

      Your organisation can respond to change with less chaos. New priorities flow through aligned functions more smoothly. You can innovate without destabilising delivery.
    rightContent: |
      ### Economic transparency

      You can see where money is spent, where value is created, and where bottlenecks constrain throughput. Investment decisions become more data-informed, less political.

      ### Reduced organisational risk

      As functions align, dependencies become visible earlier. You can avoid more late-stage conflicts, wasted effort, and expensive rework.

      - title: Credible forecasting
        icon: fa-calendar-check
        content: |
          When functions align, your forecasts gain credibility. Commitments become realistic because they reflect shared understanding.
      - title: Faster cycle time
        icon: fa-gauge-high
        content: |
          Cross-functional synchronisation reduces handoff delays. Work flows more smoothly through the organisation.

      ### Timeboxed engagements

      We work in fixed timeframes, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. No hourly billing. No scope creep. No change orders. You know the investment upfront. We adapt within the timebox based on what emerges.

      ### Risk reversal

      Full refund if standards aren't met. First-day cancellation for longer engagements, only expenses due. We carry the risk so you can engage with confidence.
    rightContent: |
      ### Collaborative discovery

      We don't fix deliverables upfront. We co-create outcomes within the retainer. Alignment work depends on what we discover together, dependencies, constraints, and opportunities you may not see yet.

      ### Engineering economics lens

      We help you see the cost of misalignment, rework, delays, conflicts, against the cost of creating shared visibility. Investment decisions become clearer when the economics are visible.
