    meta_value: "<p dir=\"ltr\">Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Joanna Płaskonka. I am a person who has a range of interests. So, don’t be surprised that I see a lot of non-obvious connections and I have some knowledge in plenty of different areas of expertise :)</p>\r\nMy educational background is related to Control Engineering and Robotics. I did not become an engineer automating a chocolate factory (like most children would dream to be), however I learned a lot and finished my PhD studies in Robotics with honors.\r\n\r\nMy professional career started in the field of Software Configuration Management. It quickly turned out to be that supporting people in creating effective processes and valuable products is what propels my career positively. My adventure with Scrum and Agile began in 2010 and continues to this day. I am currently a Professional Scrum Trainer, Agile Coach and consultant. My mission is to have a positive impact on people and organizations and deliver the best learning experience."
