The class is designed extremely well to be able to quickly dissect and understand all the parts of this framework. Russell is a fantastic instructor, and took the time to not only connect me to the material, but also to speak directly to the challenges that I will face in guiding my organization to going beyond a Mechanical Scrum.\""
