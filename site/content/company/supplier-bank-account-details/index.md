We follow a fit-for-purpose information security model tailored to the nature and scale of consulting engagements.

- **Information Security Responsibility:** Martin Hinshelwood, Managing Director is directly and solely responsible for all aspects of information security
- **Privacy Officer:** Martin Hinshelwood, Managing Director
- **Confidentiality:** All engagements are covered by mutual confidentiality terms; subcontractors, if used, are bound by equivalent agreements

- **Access Control:** Least privilege is enforced through role boundaries, access scope, and system isolation — not through redundant user account separation, which offers no additional benefit in a professionally-managed setup
