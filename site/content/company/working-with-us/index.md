  title: Working with Us
  content: Transform your organisation with engineering excellence and technical leadership through DevOps, Agile, Scrum, and Kanban. Empower teams to innovate, adapt, and deliver lasting value with clear goals and continuous feedback. Consistently. Reliably. Effectively.
---

We operate on a fixed-price model, removing the need for time tracking or seeking additional approvals to ask questions or engage for value. Fees are based on a defined time period. For example, if we agree to a 1-month engagement, the work begins on the agreed start date, and the 1-month period starts then. During this time, we can collaborate as much as needed on any topic within my expertise—whether technical, process-related, or otherwise.

To ensure quality and focus, we limit the number of concurrent customers and never start more than one engagement at a time. This allows us to dedicate the time you need while understanding that we won’t be fully engaged for the entire timebox. Typically, this means we work for you around one-third of the time, but the first few days or weeks often require more focus as we kick off. We don’t track hours, and Iwe don’t overbook engagements.

For your procurement needs, we provide [Supplier and Bank Account Details](/accounts), along with the general supplier and insurance information, as well as [Terms of Business](/terms) for the engagement.

We will provide a proposal for the engagement that contains the following sections:

## Situational Appraisal

At the start of the engagement we will conduct a situational appraisal to understand the current state of your organisation, the challenges you face, and the goals you want to achieve. This appraisal will help us tailor our approach to your specific needs and ensure that we deliver the most value during our engagement.

This may be a quick meeting or a more in-depth assessment, depending on the complexity of your situation. However we always err on the side of just getting started and working out the details later. Its much better to start adding value sooner and adapt as we discover more.

## Objectives

We will work with you to define the objectives of the engagement, and we will agree on any deliverables that will be produced. These objectives will be used to guide our work and ensure that we are focused on delivering the outcomes that you need.

## Measures of Success

We will also work with you to define the measures of success for the engagement. These measures will be used to track our progress and ensure that we are delivering the value that you expect. We will review these measures regularly and adjust our approach as needed to ensure that we are on track to meet your goals.

Some typical measures of success include:

- Participation rates in training sessions or workshops, with positive feedback from attendees. Participant assessment scores if available.
- Evidence of teams applying the learned principles, such as improved workflow practices or adherence to relevant  practices. Measures using [NKD Insights™](/capabilities/nkd-insights/). Available with all strategic partnership options.
- Evidence of organisation delivering more value to their customers. Measured using [Evidence-Based Management](/resources/guides/the-evidence-based-management-guide-improving-value-delivery-under-conditions-of-uncertainty/) metrics chosen at the start of the engagement. Available with all strategic partnership options.
- Completion of technical requirements such as migration of work items or test cases

## Value to the Customer

To achieve the best results, we need to work together to ensure that we are aligned on the goals of the engagement and that we are both committed to delivering value. We will work with you to define the value that you expect to receive from the engagement and ensure that we are focused on delivering that value.

Some typical value propositions include:

- Empowered Teams: Equip teams with the knowledge and skills to independently adopt best practices in Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps, fostering productivity and continuous improvement.
- Strategic Decision-Making: Provide clear, actionable insights through well-organised and visualised data to align tactical activities with long-term strategic goals.
- Simplified Management: Streamline Azure DevOps into a single, transparent collection for easier oversight, reduced complexity, and improved efficiency.
- Accelerated Delivery: Enable teams to fully utilise Azure DevOps capabilities for faster, high-quality software delivery and enhanced collaboration.

## Timing

We will give you an indication of when we can start the engagement and how long it will take to complete. We will work with you to ensure that we can meet your deadlines and deliver the value that you expect.
