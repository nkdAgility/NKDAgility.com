We operate on a fixed-price model, removing the need for time tracking or seeking additional approvals to ask questions or engage for value. Fees are based on a defined time period. For example, if we agree to a 1-month engagement, the work begins on the agreed start date, and the 1-month period starts then. During this time, we can collaborate as much as needed on any topic within my expertise—whether technical, process-related, or otherwise.

> [!TIP]
> Choose your engagement up front:
>
> - _Engagement **Timebox**_: 1 week, 30 days, or 90 days (weekly, monthly, or quarterly).
> - _Engagement **Level**_: Light, Supportive, Regular, or Deep. See details below in [Engagement Levels](#engagement-levels) and pricing in our [Terms of Business]({{< ref "/company/terms-of-business" >}}).

To ensure quality and focus, we limit the number of concurrent customers and never start more than one engagement at a time. This allows us to dedicate the time you need while understanding that we won’t be fully engaged for the entire timebox. Typically, this means we work for you around one-third of the time, but the first few days or weeks often require more focus as we kick off. We don’t track hours, and we don’t overbook engagements.

For your procurement needs, we provide [Supplier and Bank Account Details]({{< ref "/company/supplier-bank-account-details" >}}), along with the general supplier and insurance information, as well as [Terms of Business]({{< ref "/company/terms-of-business" >}}) for the engagement.

As part of our partnership we want you to be able to [communicate with us]({{< ref "/company/communicating-with-us" >}})as easily as possible. We use Microsoft Teams and the linked instructions will allow your IT department to configure your systems to allow us to communicate with you.

We will provide a proposal for the engagement that contains the following sections:

## Situational Appraisal

At the start of the engagement we will conduct a situational appraisal to understand the current state of your organisation, the challenges you face, and the goals you want to achieve. This appraisal will help us tailor our approach to your specific needs and ensure that we deliver the most value during our engagement.

This may be a quick meeting or a more in-depth assessment, depending on the complexity of your situation. However we always err on the side of just getting started and working out the details later. Its much better to start adding value sooner and adapt as we discover more.

## Objectives

We will work with you to define the objectives of the engagement, and we will agree on any deliverables that will be produced. These objectives will be used to guide our work and ensure that we are focused on delivering the outcomes that you need.

## Measures of Success

We will also work with you to define the measures of success for the engagement. These measures will be used to track our progress and ensure that we are delivering the value that you expect. We will review these measures regularly and adjust our approach as needed to ensure that we are on track to meet your goals.

Some typical measures of success include:

- Participation rates in training sessions or workshops, with positive feedback from attendees. Participant assessment scores if available.
- Evidence of teams applying the learned principles, such as improved workflow practices or adherence to relevant practices. Measures using [NKD Insights™]({{< ref "/capabilities/nkd-insights" >}}). Available with all strategic partnership options.
- Evidence of organisation delivering more value to their customers. Measured using [Evidence-Based Management]({{< ref "/resources/guides/evidence-based-management-guide" >}}) metrics chosen at the start of the engagement. Available with all strategic partnership options.
- Completion of technical requirements such as migration of work items or test cases

## Value to the Customer

To achieve the best results, we need to work together to ensure that we are aligned on the goals of the engagement and that we are both committed to delivering value. We will work with you to define the value that you expect to receive from the engagement and ensure that we are focused on delivering that value.

Some typical value propositions include:

- Empowered Teams: Equip teams with the knowledge and skills to independently adopt best practices in Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps, fostering productivity and continuous improvement.
- Strategic Decision-Making: Provide clear, actionable insights through well-organised and visualised data to align tactical activities with long-term strategic goals.
- One Engineering System: Streamline engineering tools into a single, transparent collection for easier oversight, reduced complexity, and improved efficiency.
- Continuous Improvement: Establish a culture of continuous learning and improvement through regular training, workshops, and feedback loops.
- Technical Excellence: Enhance technical capabilities and practices to deliver high-quality products and services that meet customer needs and expectations.
- Value Delivery: Improve the speed and quality of value delivery through optimised workflows, reduced waste, and increased transparency.
- Customer Satisfaction: Increase customer satisfaction by delivering high-quality products and services that meet customer needs and expectations.
- Business Agility: Enable the organisation to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs through flexible, responsive practices and processes.
- Evidence-Based Leadership: Utilise [Evidence-Based Management]({{< ref "/resources/guides/evidence-based-management-guide" >}}) and [NKD Insights™]({{< ref "/capabilities/nkd-insights" >}}) for real-time analytics, fostering data-driven decision-making at all levels.

## Timing

We will give you an indication of when we can start the engagement and how long it will take to complete. We will work with you to ensure that we can meet your deadlines and deliver the value that you expect.

## Methodology and Models

Our engagement is centred on enabling organisations to achieve engineering excellence and technical leadership. We offer three models to tailor our approach to your needs:

- **Advisory**: Strategic guidance and mentorship to shape direction and outcomes.
- **Embedded**: Hands-on collaboration with delivery teams to improve practices and accelerate outcomes.
- **Fractional Exec**: Executive-level involvement to drive transformation and align leadership with organisational goals.

> **Our Ethos**: At NKDAgility, we believe in delivering measurable outcomes through transparency, flexibility, and collaboration. Our goal is to empower your teams to achieve sustainable improvements while aligning with your strategic objectives.

### Value to the Customer

Our engagements are designed to deliver measurable outcomes while empowering your teams and aligning with your strategic goals. Some typical value propositions include:

#### Empowerment

- Equip teams with the knowledge and skills to independently adopt best practices in Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps.
- Establish a culture of continuous learning and improvement through regular training, workshops, and feedback loops.

#### Strategic Alignment

- Provide clear, actionable insights through well-organized and visualized data to align tactical activities with long-term goals.

### Engagement Levels

Engagement levels are available across all models, allowing you to select the level of involvement that best suits your needs. Each level represents a percentage of our capacity, with indicative hours per week and typical involvement.

{{< table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| **Engagement Level** | **%** | **\~Hours/Week** | **Typical Involvement** |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Light** | 2.5% | \~0.5 hr | Very light touch, async-only, ad hoc input |
| **Supportive** | 5% | \~1–2 hrs | Light input, async feedback, occasional check-ins |
| **Regular** | 25% | \~6–8 hrs | Regular reviews, pairing, shaping delivery and direction |
| **Deep** | 50% | \~14–16 hrs | Deep collaboration, hands-on support, stakeholder engagement |
| **Strategic** | 75% | \~20–24 hrs | Transformation ownership, cross-team leadership, org-level impact |
| **Full-time** | 100% | \~32 hrs | Not offered; equivalent to full-time role |
{{< /table >}}

> [!NOTE]
> The engagement level determines the percentage of our capacity allocated to your organisation, while the model defines the type of collaboration.

The hours in the table are indicative and may vary based on the specific needs of the engagement. We focus on delivering value, not just filling time.

### Service Scope & Change Flexibility

We don’t fix scope up front. We work within the constraints of the retainer and adapt continuously based on evolving needs.

- **No change orders.** We don’t treat new discoveries or emerging needs as exceptions.
- **Responsive to context.** You can pivot, refocus, or pause direction as long as it fits within the retainer capacity.
- **Collaborative planning.** We’ll inspect and adapt together to ensure we’re always working on what matters most.

You get flexibility without micromanagement. We get clarity without red tape.

Our services are timeboxed, prepaid, and delivered collaboratively. We are not a body shop. We help you examine and evolve your systems—your ways of working—not just deliver tasks.

- **No fixed deliverables.** We co-create outcomes within the agreed timebox.
- **Refund guarantee.** If you’re not satisfied, we refund you.
- **First-day risk reversal.** If you cancel after day one of a virtual or longer in-person engagement, only T\&E will be due.
- **Full transparency.** We openly share progress, findings, and risks. You do the same.

### Shared Responsibilities

We succeed together. This means active, open collaboration between your team and ours.

- **You provide access to the right people** – so we can explore context, align on goals, and inspect progress.
- **We expect regular feedback and conversation** – to keep work aligned and adaptive.
- **You commit to decisions and follow-through** – outcomes depend on timely action and focus.
- **We share risks, insights, and discoveries** – transparently and frequently.

When both sides are engaged, we make meaningful change happen.
