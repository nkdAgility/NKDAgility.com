## Consulting Practice Privacy

### Services and Data Regions

We use the following third-party services for our consulting services, which process or store personal data:

  Used for invoicing, billing, and customer management. Data stored primarily in Google Cloud Platform data centers in the United States.

- **Remarkable (SaaS Norway)**
  Used for note-taking and documentation. Data is processed and stored within Remarkable's infrastructure based in Norway.

- **Azure DevOps (Azure EU/US)**
  Used for software development, work item management, and migration activities. Data including project management information and personal identifiers (names, emails) is processed in Azure data centers located in the European Union and United States.

- **GitHub (Global)**
  Used for software development and collaboration. Data stored globally in GitHub's distributed infrastructure primarily located in the United States. Includes usage of **GitHub Copilot** to support engineering activities.

- **1Password (Global)**
  Used to securely store passwords, keys, and sensitive information. Data stored in 1Password's secure global infrastructure.

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI Enterprise, EU Hosted)**
  Used for structured analysis, summarisation, and AI-supported engineering insights. All prompts and responses are excluded from training and model improvement. OpenAI Enterprise settings ensure no prompts, files, or metadata are retained or used to retrain any models.

> We do not use free-tier or consumer-grade AI services. All AI tools used in our consulting practice are enterprise-grade and configured for privacy, security, and data sovereignty. We avoid any services that cannot guarantee enterprise-grade data governance.

### Data We Collect and Process

We may collect and process the following personal information during our consulting engagements:

- Names and contact information (including email addresses)
- Correspondence and meeting content, including audio or video recordings and transcriptions
- Notes and documentation created during engagements
- Any migration work involving Azure DevOps or GitHub, where data including PII (names, emails associated with work items) would transit through either our local machine in Scotland or a VM provisioned in Azure (EU/US). This includes the names and emails of all contributors, past and present.
- Source code downloaded to assist with engineering practices
- Security keys and passwords used to access your infrastructure, securely stored in 1Password

### How We Use Your Data

Your personal information is used solely for providing consulting services, managing client relationships, performing technical migrations, assisting with engineering practices, and related activities. We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties other than the services explicitly mentioned in this statement.

### Infrastructure and Data Security

All our infrastructure uses encryption at rest, leveraging the latest hardware equipped with Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology. All systems are regularly updated with the latest operating system and application patches to minimize security risks and ensure data protection.

## Azure DevOps Migration Tools Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. The Azure DevOps Migration Tools are designed with transparency and minimal data handling in mind.

### Data Processing

All data used during a migration is processed locally on the machine running the tool. No project data, work items, or other customer content is sent to external services or transmitted over the internet by the tools themselves.

### Logging and Telemetry

To improve the stability, performance, and reliability of the tools, we collect basic diagnostic and operational data:

- **Application Insights (EU)**
  We use Microsoft Application Insights, hosted in the European Union, to collect anonymous telemetry such as command usage, performance metrics, and error rates.

- **Elmah.io**
  We use Elmah.io for logging and error tracking. Logs may include technical details about the environment and exceptions but do not include user data or project content.

No personally identifiable information is collected through these tools unless you explicitly provide it via forms or interactions.

### Consent and Data Transfers
