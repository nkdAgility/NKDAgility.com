# Privacy Policy

## Azure DevOps Migration Tools

We take your privacy seriously. The Azure DevOps Migration Tools are designed with transparency and minimal data handling in mind.

### Data Processing

All data used during a migration is processed **locally on the machine** running the tool. No project data, work items, or other customer content is sent to external services or transmitted over the internet by the tools themselves.

### Logging and Telemetry

To improve the stability, performance, and reliability of the tools, we collect basic diagnostic and operational data:

- **Application Insights (EU)**  
  We use Microsoft Application Insights, hosted in the European Union, to collect anonymous telemetry such as command usage, performance metrics, and error rates.

- **Elmah.io**  
  We use Elmah.io for logging and error tracking. Logs may include technical details about the environment and exceptions but do not include user data or project content.

## Website Data Collection

When you visit our website, we may collect anonymous usage data to help us understand visitor behaviour and improve the site experience. This includes:

- **Breva**  
  Used to collect visitor interaction data and provide insights into user journeys across the website.

- **Google Analytics**  
  Helps us track general usage patterns and measure the effectiveness of content and navigation.

- **Google Tag Manager**  
  Used to manage tracking scripts and third-party tags without modifying site code.

No personally identifiable information is collected through these tools unless you explicitly provide it via forms or interactions.

### Data Security and Compliance

All diagnostic and analytical data is handled in accordance with GDPR and other applicable data protection regulations. We do not sell or share any personally identifiable information with third parties.

If you have any questions about this policy or wish to request the removal of telemetry or analytics data, please contact us.
