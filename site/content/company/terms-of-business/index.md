# Overview of our Terms

The rates, terms, and conditions that naked Agility Ltd. are proud to operate by…

Thanks for choosing naked Agility Ltd. Our mission is to delight our customers with our knowledge, expertise, and professionalism in delivering onsite consulting and training. Our private consulting and training are provided online using Microsoft Teams and Mural and are governed by our consulting Terms of Business described here. Onsite is also available at an additional cost.

If you are looking for our approach to engaging, then please see [https://nkdagility.com/#our-services](https://nkdagility.com/#our-services).

**NOTE**: Due to the volatility of the GBP, all invoices will be in EUR or USD unless otherwise agreed.

## Try Before You Buy

We are so confident that you will want to retain our consulting services that our initial first-day consultation rate will only be charged if you retain our services. Minimizing your risk is very important to us, so for all virtual engagements (and in-person engagements greater than 5 days), we allow you to cancel after the first day if you feel we are incompatible with your organization. We can call it quits at that point, and only T&E would be due.

Prices are variable based on the commitment length and agreements around travel, expenses, & training. They are for illustrative purposes only and are valid through June 30 of the current financial year.

### TL;DR:

- **Rates**: All rates are subject to commercial considerations and are exclusive of Travel, Expenses, & local Tax if applicable.
- **Long engagements**: 2.5% drop after six months and 5% after 12 months.
- **Onsite Fee**: An additional fee is charged for Onsite Consulting and Training. This is calculated based on the number of expected travel days and is charged at the prevailing consulting or training rate.
- **IP**: All rates exclude IP ownership for software, documentation, and materials.
- **IR-35 (UK Only)**: We do not operate under IR-35. Commercial policies that may put us at risk of IR-35 will have an additional fee of 40%.
- **Per Student Training**: Additional per-student costs apply depending on the training.
- **Purchasing Power**: To be fair to all regions, we offer discounted rates to secondary and tertiary.

## Pre-Paid Consulting

We understand that sometimes our customers need shorter-term help. To support this, we offer pre-paid hours in blocks of 7 (at the standard consulting rate above) that can be purchased by the customer. We will add a credit to your account that can be used by contacting naked Agility Ltd and scheduling remote time with one of our consultants. We will always endeavor to respond quickly; however, as we may be on-site with other customers, we may not be able to schedule soon.

Pre-paid consulting of 40 hours or less is due in advance.

## Supporting the World

To help the world build better software and meet this goal with more outstanding professionalism, reliability, quality, and value, we calculate all of our fees (public and private) based on these country categories.

These categories are based on each country’s average GDP (PPP) per capita.

These categories are automatically applied throughout the site based on your selected country, which is initially chosen automatically, and you can change it. Once the correct billing country is selected in the cart, any corrections will be applied at this time.

You can find the list of categories on [Prices by Country](https://nkdagility.com/#prices).
