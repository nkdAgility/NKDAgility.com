We offer outcome-focused consulting services delivered through a timeboxed retainer model. Rather than buying hours, you retain a percentage of our capacity to co-create meaningful outcomes. We focus on helping you evolve your system of work—not just deliver tasks. If you're not satisfied, we refund your fee.

We are transparent, collaborative, and committed to protecting your confidentiality. We will sign any reasonable NDA, and any intellectual property created specifically for you remains yours.

Please refer to [working with us]({{< ref "/company/working-with-us" >}}) and [privacy practices]({{< ref "/company/privacy" >}}) for additional information on our practices.

## Our business model

We work on a **timeboxed retainer** basis. You retain a percentage of our working time—typically 10% or 25%—and we spend the time required within that limit to deliver valuable outcomes. There is **no fixed scope**, and **no change orders**—just a shared commitment to evolving your system of work.

- **You control the pace** and can reschedule within the agreed timeframe.
- **We collaborate continuously**, providing as much or as little direction as needed.
- If you’re not satisfied with our work, **we’ll refund you—no questions asked**.

> **Our Ethos**: At NKDAgility, we believe in delivering measurable outcomes through transparency, flexibility, and collaboration. Our goal is to empower your teams to achieve sustainable improvements while aligning with your strategic objectives.

You’re not buying hours. You’re retaining strategic capacity—continuous access to expert collaboration without transactional overhead. You shouldn’t need to make a financial decision every time you need support. These engagement levels reflect ongoing involvement and commitment, not time blocks. The hours are indicative only; we typically invest more time early in the engagement, which is why we don’t start more than one at a time.

### Model Overview

| **Model**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advisory**        | Strategic support focused on direction, quality, and outcome shaping. Involves regular reviews, co-planning, and mentorship without deep operational involvement. Ideal when internal teams need guidance, not hands-on delivery.        |
| **Embedded**        | Direct integration with delivery teams. Provides hands-on support, close collaboration, and technical or organisational coaching. Suitable for shaping delivery systems, improving practices, and accelerating outcomes.                 |
| **Fractional Exec** | Executive-level involvement driving transformation across teams or domains. Includes ownership of change initiatives, leadership alignment, and outcomes at the organisational level. Acts as a temporary member of the leadership team. |

### Engagement Levels

Engagement levels are available across all models, allowing you to select the level of involvement that best suits your needs. Each level represents a percentage of our capacity, with indicative hours per week and typical involvement.

{{< table "table table-striped table-bordered" >}}

| **Engagement Level** | **%** | **\~Hours/Week** | **Typical Involvement**                                           |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supportive**       | 5%    | \~1–2 hrs        | Light input, async feedback, occasional check-ins                 |
| **Regular**          | 25%   | \~6–8 hrs        | Regular reviews, pairing, shaping delivery and direction          |
| **Deep**             | 50%   | \~14–16 hrs      | Deep collaboration, hands-on support, stakeholder engagement      |
| **Strategic**        | 75%   | \~20–24 hrs      | Transformation ownership, cross-team leadership, org-level impact |
| **Full-time**        | 100%  | \~32 hrs         | Not offered; equivalent to full-time role                         |

{{< /table >}}

> [!NOTE]
> The engagement level determines the percentage of our capacity allocated to your organisation, while the model defines the type of collaboration.

The hours in the table are indicative and may vary based on the specific needs of the engagement. We focus on delivering value, not just filling time.

### Service Scope & Change Flexibility

We don’t fix scope up front. We work within the constraints of the retainer and adapt continuously based on evolving needs.

- **No change orders.** We don’t treat new discoveries or emerging needs as exceptions.
- **Responsive to context.** You can pivot, refocus, or pause direction as long as it fits within the retainer capacity.
- **Collaborative planning.** We’ll inspect and adapt together to ensure we’re always working on what matters most.

You get flexibility without micromanagement. We get clarity without red tape.

Our services are timeboxed, prepaid, and delivered collaboratively. We are not a body shop. We help you examine and evolve your systems—your ways of working—not just deliver tasks.

- **No fixed deliverables.** We co-create outcomes within the agreed timebox.
- **Refund guarantee.** If you’re not satisfied, we refund you.
- **First-day risk reversal.** If you cancel after day one of a virtual or longer in-person engagement, only T\&E will be due.
- **Full transparency.** We openly share progress, findings, and risks. You do the same.

### Shared Responsibilities

We succeed together. This means active, open collaboration between your team and ours.

- **You provide access to the right people** – so we can explore context, align on goals, and inspect progress.
- **We expect regular feedback and conversation** – to keep work aligned and adaptive.
- **You commit to decisions and follow-through** – outcomes depend on timely action and focus.
- **We share risks, insights, and discoveries** – transparently and frequently.

When both sides are engaged, we make meaningful change happen.

## UK Legal Compliance (IR35)

For services delivered within the United Kingdom:

- naked Agility Ltd operates as an **independent consultancy**. There is no employment relationship, supervision, or control by the client.
- We deliver **outcome-based services** under a timeboxed retainer, with **no fixed hours or location requirements**.
- We may engage subcontractors under our supervision and provide substitution where needed.
- You are not purchasing individual labour or day-rate resources. You are **retaining access to strategic consulting outcomes**.
- If your procurement policy or internal legal interpretation requires **IR35 compliance**, an additional surcharge of 40% will apply to cover the legal, tax, and administrative overheads of that risk position.

This clause applies **only to UK engagements**. It does not affect services delivered outside the United Kingdom.

## Terms of Payment

- 50% due upon acceptance; 50% due 15 days after acceptance.
- A 5% discount is available for full payment upon acceptance.
- This project is non-cancellable but may be rescheduled without penalty.
- Satisfaction guaranteed—if standards aren't met, we will refund your fee.
- Payment is accepted in GBP, USD, or EUR. [Bank details are provided here](/accounts).

## Intellectual Property & Confidentiality

- All proprietary materials created specifically for you during the engagement are **yours**.
- General content, documents, tools, templates, and training materials remain the property of naked Agility Ltd.
- **We grant you full rights to use what we deliver.** Use, modify, and apply it however you need internally, but it may not be shared with another company or entity.
- We may involve trusted subcontractors under our direct supervision. All are bound by the same confidentiality and ethical standards.
- We are happy to sign your NDA. If you don’t have one, our standard mutual NDA applies:

> Each party agrees to keep confidential any information marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered confidential. Confidential information may be disclosed to employees and subcontractors bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations. Disclosure is permitted when required by law or with prior written consent.

## Location, Rates, and Onsite

- Most services are delivered **remotely** using Microsoft Teams and Mural.
- On-site work is available at an additional rate covering travel time, expenses, and disruption.
- We apply pricing adjustments based on **purchasing power parity**. See [Prices by Country](https://nkdagility.com/#prices).

## Commercial Terms

We keep billing simple, clear, and consistent with our ethos: outcome-focused work, full transparency, and flexibility within agreed bounds. We minimise admin overhead, avoid surprises, and work with your finance team to make the process smooth.

### Travel & Expenses

We keep travel lean, fair, and agreed in advance.

- **Actuals, not guesswork** – You’ll only be charged for real, necessary travel costs (flights, transport, lodging). We don’t markup expenses.
- **Reasonable per diem** – If actual receipts aren’t practical, we charge a standard per diem of {{< currency 70 >}}/day depending on location to cover incidentals.
- **Return-home principle** – Our consultants aim to return home on weekends unless the logistics or value of the work make that impractical. We’ll always discuss this openly.
- **Billed with transparency** – Travel and expenses are invoiced monthly or at the end of the engagement, whichever comes first.

This approach avoids complexity while ensuring you’re never surprised.

### Invoicing

- naked Agility Ltd will issue electronic invoices that exclude taxes. Invoices are generated either upon completion of the engagement or monthly, depending on which occurs first.
- **VAT (UK only)**: VAT is automatically applied to invoices in the UK.
- All invoices exclude local taxes unless agreed otherwise. If specific taxes must be represented on the invoice due to local legal requirements, notify us. We will send an updated invoice that reflects any necessary withholdings.
- Payments are due within 14 days of receiving the invoice (NET14). Following UK government guidelines for late commercial payments, late payments may incur interest at 8% above the bank base rate.

### Engagement Rates

Fees are all-inclusive for remote work.

{{< consulting-rates >}}

These fees do **not include training**, however, the **quarterly retainer** includes a discount on training, noted above.

### Training Rates

We publish our training class pricing for transparency. All prices below are in GBP and exclusive of VAT.

{{< training-rates >}}

These rates apply to private onsite or virtual training where all participants are from the same company.

Private training costs vary depending on the course being delivered and do not include T\&E. An invoice would be provided up-front, and a deposit is required to secure dates. The deposit will be deducted from the final cost + T\&E and will be due by the end of the training or the week in which the training occurs, whichever comes first, and unless otherwise agreed, is due upon receipt.

Prices are variable based on the length of commitment and agreements around travel, expenses, & training and are for illustrative purposes only.

For onsite, travel time is charged at the relevant day rate and is exclusive of Travel & Expenses.

Public class pricing reflects the per-person rate.

#### Training Course Cost Calculation

NKDAgility calculates training course costs using a session-based pricing model with scaling factors for different group sizes and proficiency levels. This covers accreditation fees, content creation, delivery, follow-up support, and assessment fees.

The calculation starts with a base session rate of {{< training-rate >}} for up to 12 students per 4-hour session. This base rate is adjusted according to the course proficiency level: beginner courses receive a 20% discount, intermediate courses use the standard rate, and advanced courses include a 20% premium.

The total course cost is determined by multiplying the adjusted session rate by the number of sessions in the syllabus.

For larger groups, additional pricing tiers apply: 16 students incur a 10% surcharge and additional students above that incur a 20% surcharge.

### Migration Rates

Although we typically deliver migrations under the timeboxed retainer model, we also offer fixed-price migration services for specific scenarios. Please contact us for a tailored quote based on your migration needs.

For per-project migrations, our standard pricing structure includes:

{{< migration-rates >}}

We are the creators and primary maintainers of the [Azure DevOps Migration Tools](https://devopsmigration.io) that we use for many migrations. For complex migrations requiring custom tool development or significant adaptation, additional fees may apply based on the scope of work.

### Rates & Discounts

- Standard consulting and training rates are published for transparency.
- A 5% discount is offered for full payment upon acceptance.
- An additional fee of **40%** applies to UK IR35-risky contracts.

### Cancellation Policy

- All engagements are non-cancellable, but may be rescheduled without penalty.
- You are entitled to a full refund if we fail to meet the agreed standard.

## Working Environment & Access

We work securely, independently, and with only the access needed to deliver outcomes.

- **We bring our own gear** – up-to-date, secured, and encrypted.
- **We work in the cloud**, primarily Office 365. If collaboration requires access, we’ll let you know.
- **Minimal client-side access** – only what’s necessary. Credentials are treated as confidential and never reused.
- **We prefer automation-friendly access, such as API keys and service accounts,** over manual logins.
- **Revocable and auditable** – you control access and visibility.
- **We clean up on exit** – credentials are deleted or returned at the end of the engagement.
- **We don’t rely on client hardware or procurement** – unless agreed otherwise, which may affect estimates.

This keeps delivery fast, secure, and focused—without unnecessary operational drag.

### Account Provisioning and Access

NKD Agility consultants operate exclusively from NKD Agility–managed systems and do not use customer-provided email or calendars. We prefer Microsoft Entra ID Guest accounts for all collaboration and recommend avoiding on-premises Active Directory (AD) accounts except in limited, unavoidable cases, such as when access to your on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) is required as part of a migration. In such cases, AD accounts should be created without a mailbox and with minimal permissions. Full configuration and security requirements are detailed in our [Communication & Security Setup Guide]({{< ref "/company/communicating-with-us" >}}).

### Security and Device Compliance

All NKD Agility systems are Microsoft Entra domain-joined with enforced encryption, updates, security policies, and antivirus. If you require us to access your cloud applications with additional security controls, please:

1. Add our domain to your cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra ID.
2. Trust our Conditional Access policies for guest users across all relevant cloud apps, if you require multifactor authentication or compliant/hybrid-joined devices.

See instructions on [Communication & Security Setup Guide]({{< ref "/company/communicating-with-us" >}}).

## Knowledge Sharing & Open Contribution

We encourage our consultants to contribute back to the broader community through blog posts, talks, or open-source projects—especially when tackling real-world technical challenges during engagements. However, no client-specific or identifiable information will ever be shared.

This approach supports transparency, learning, and the evolution of better practices while fully respecting client confidentiality.

## Responsible AI & Agentic Systems

We use AI tools responsibly to accelerate insight, explore ideas, and support co-creation—but always with human agency and judgment at the centre.

- **Human-led, AI-supported** – Any AI used is there to support, not replace, our expertise and accountability.
- **No client data is used for model training** – Client information is never shared with public AI systems.
- **You define boundaries** – We follow your data, privacy, and security requirements.
- **Agentic collaboration** – We use AI to augment sensemaking, decision framing, and option shaping—always under transparent, human control.

We are committed to ethically sound and practically grounded use of AI in every engagement.

## Security Incident Response Commitment

All incidents affecting client systems or data will be disclosed within 24 hours of discovery, with follow-up reporting as investigation continues.

## Health, Safety & Duty of Care

We’re committed to safe and respectful collaboration, onsite and online.

- **We follow medical and safety guidance**, including local regulations on vaccinations, PPE, and working conditions.
- **We will disclose vaccination status if required**, and meet relevant public health standards before any onsite engagement.
- **We comply with health and safety laws** – including the UK Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and similar legislation elsewhere.
- **We assess risks where appropriate** and work with you to mitigate them.
- **You provide a safe working environment** – When onsite, the client is responsible for ensuring reasonable physical safety for our team.

## Engagement Duration

Each engagement begins upon written acceptance and initial payment. Unless otherwise agreed, retainers renew monthly or quarterly, depending on the selected plan. Either party may choose not to renew with written notice prior to the next billing period.

## Limitation of Liability

We carry {{< currency 1000000 >}} professional indemnity insurance and operate under reasonable limits of liability. We are not liable for indirect or consequential loss. If there's a concern, we’ll address it directly and transparently.

## Issue Resolution

If an issue arises, we commit to open, respectful dialogue to resolve it quickly. Legal action is always a last resort.

## Final Notes

- All services are governed by the terms on this page.
- These terms are subject to change. The latest version is always available at [nkdagility.com/terms](https://nkdagility.com/terms).
- AI tools may assist legal and policy comparisons under strict privacy controls. No content is used for training or retained by the provider.
