# Overview of our Terms

The rates, terms, and conditions that naked Agility Ltd. are proud to operate by…

Thanks for choosing naked Agility Ltd. Our mission is to delight our customers with our knowledge, expertise, and professionalism in delivering onsite consulting and training. Our private consulting and training are provided online using Microsoft Teams and Mural and are governed by our consulting Terms of Business described here. Onsite is also available at an additional cost.

If you are looking for our approach to engaging, then please see [our capabilities(https://nkdagility.com/capabilities).

## Try Before You Buy

We are so confident that you will want to retain our consulting services that our initial first-day consultation rate will only be charged if you retain our services. Minimizing your risk is very important to us, so for all virtual engagements (and in-person engagements greater than 5 days), we allow you to cancel after the first day if you feel we are incompatible with your organization. We can call it quits at that point, and only T&E would be due.

Prices are variable based on the commitment length and agreements around travel, expenses, & training. They are for illustrative purposes only and are valid through June 30 of the current financial year.

### TL;DR:

- **Rates**: All rates are subject to commercial considerations and are exclusive of Travel, Expenses, & local Tax if applicable.
- **Long engagements**: 2.5% drop after six months and 5% after 12 months.
- **Onsite Fee**: An additional fee is charged for Onsite Consulting and Training. This is calculated based on the number of expected travel days and is charged at the prevailing consulting or training rate.
- **IP**: All rates exclude IP ownership for software, documentation, and materials.
- **IR-35 (UK Only)**: We do not operate under IR-35. Commercial policies that may put us at risk of IR-35 will have an additional fee of 40% to cover the risks.
- **Per Student Training**: Additional per-student costs apply depending on the training.
- **Purchasing Power**: To be fair to all regions, we offer discounted rates to secondary and tertiary.

## Pre-Paid Consulting

We understand that sometimes our customers need shorter-term help. To support this, we offer pre-paid hours in blocks of 7 (at the standard consulting rate above) that can be purchased by the customer. We will add a credit to your account that can be used by contacting naked Agility Ltd and scheduling remote time with one of our consultants. We will always endeavor to respond quickly; however, as we may be on-site with other customers, we may not be able to schedule soon.

Pre-paid consulting of 40 hours or less is due in advance.

---

## Supporting the World

To help the world build better software and meet this goal with more outstanding professionalism, reliability, quality, and value, we calculate all of our fees (public and private) based on these country categories.

These categories are based on each country’s average GDP (PPP) per capita.

These categories are automatically applied throughout the site based on your selected country, which is initially chosen automatically, and you can change it. Once the correct billing country is selected in the cart, any corrections will be applied at this time.

You can find the list of categories on [Prices by Country](https://nkdagility.com/#prices).

## Training Rates

These rates apply to private onsite or virtual training where all participants are from the same company.

Private training costs vary depending on the course being delivered and do not include T&E. An invoice would be provided up-front, and a deposit is required to secure dates. The deposit will be deducted from the final cost + T&E and will be due by the end of the training or the week in which the training occurs, whichever comes first, and unless otherwise agreed, is due upon receipt.

Prices are variable based on the length of commitment and agreements around travel, expenses, & training and are for illustrative purposes only.

For onsite, travel time is charged at the relevant day rate and is exclusive of Travel & Expenses.

## Cancellation Policy

- **Notice of Cancellation**: You have the right to cancel or reschedule an engagement without incurring any charges, provided that you give us notice of at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the scheduled date of the engagement.
- **Cancellation Fees**: If you cancel or reschedule with less than 15 business days' notice but at least 10 business days' notice, a 20% cancellation fee will apply. If less than 10 business days' notice is given, the full engagement price will be due.

When rewriting legal or business terms for better readability, the goal is to maintain clarity, consistency, and structure while simplifying the language where possible. For business terms like invoicing, expenses, and intellectual property rights, a standard format includes clear headings, concise paragraphs, and bullet points where appropriate. The structure should help break complex information into digestible parts.

Here’s the revised version in a more readable format:

---

# Invoicing, Expenses, and Cancellation

## Invoicing

- naked Agility Ltd will issue electronic invoices that exclude taxes. Invoices are generated either upon completion of the engagement or monthly, depending on which occurs first.
- **VAT (UK only)**: For invoices in the UK, VAT is automatically applied.
- All invoices exclude local taxes unless agreed otherwise. If specific taxes must be represented on the invoice due to local legal requirements, notify us. We will send an updated invoice that reflects any necessary withholdings.

- Payments are due within 14 days of receiving the invoice (NET14). Late payments may incur interest at 8% above the bank base rate, following UK government guidelines for late commercial payments.

---

## Travel and Expenses (T&E)

- Travel and expenses (T&E) are invoiced either upon completion of the engagement or monthly, depending on which occurs first.
- Costs for onsite engagements (airfare, lodging, transportation) will be billed as actual expenses. A per diem of £35 GBP per day (or actual expenses) will be charged.
- While we strive to minimize T&E, our consultants typically expect to return home on weekends. This may not always be feasible for engagements outside of Europe, especially for long-term engagements.

**Note**: It may be more cost-effective for clients to book travel and accommodations.
