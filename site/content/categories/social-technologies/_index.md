description: Social technologies like Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Agile practices are adaptive frameworks that enable organisations to deliver value, foster collaboration, and drive continuous improvement. Scrum provides a structured approach for iterative development and team accountability, Kanban enhances flow and transparency through visual management, and Lean focuses on eliminating waste for maximum efficiency. Together, these practices serve as dynamic tools for teams to respond swiftly to change, optimise processes, and sustain innovation in complex environments. Explore how social technologies empower teams to build better products, faster, while continuously evolving their ways of working.
