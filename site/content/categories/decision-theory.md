description: Decision-making in uncertain environments using heuristics, probability, and behavioural economics.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Decision Theory.**  
  Decision Theory encompasses the study of decision-making processes in uncertain environments, focusing on the application of heuristics, probability, and behavioural economics to improve outcomes. This category aims to explore how individuals and organisations can make informed choices when faced with uncertainty and complexity.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Heuristics and biases in decision-making
  - The role of probability in assessing risks and outcomes
  - Behavioural economics and its impact on choices
  - Decision-making frameworks and models
  - The influence of cognitive psychology on decision processes
  - Strategies for improving decision quality in uncertain environments
  - Applications of decision theory in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps contexts

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to decision-making processes, such as technical implementations or specific Agile methodologies without a focus on decision-making.
  - Misinterpretations of decision theory that do not align with its core principles, such as deterministic approaches that ignore uncertainty.
