ClassificationType: categories
trustpilot: false
abstract: Kanban is a change management strategy that focuses on improving workflow and value delivery within organisations, rather than being merely a tool or visual board. Originating from Lean principles and systems thinking, Kanban encourages teams to begin with their current processes, fostering an understanding of existing systems to facilitate evolutionary improvements. Unlike prescriptive frameworks that dictate roles or time constraints, Kanban emphasises observability through visualisation of work, limiting work in progress, managing flow, and making policies explicit. This approach helps identify bottlenecks and supports evidence-based enhancements without necessitating major organisational changes. By complementing methodologies like Scrum and DevOps, Kanban enhances transparency and decision-making, allowing teams to adapt their practices over time based on feedback and performance metrics such as lead time and throughput. While often misconceived as merely a visual task management tool, the true strength of Kanban lies in its ability to create a shared understanding of system dynamics, enabling strategic improvements. This empowers teams to deliver value in a predictable, sustainable manner, making Kanban a vital strategy for organisations operating in complex and rapidly changing environments.

Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Kanban.**  
  The Kanban category focuses on the principles and practices of the Kanban methodology as outlined in the Kanban Guide. It emphasises the visualisation of work, management of flow, and continuous improvement to enhance value delivery in various contexts.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Visualisation of work processes and tasks using Kanban boards.
  - Limiting work in progress (WIP) to improve flow and efficiency.
  - Managing and optimising the flow of work through various stages.
  - Continuous improvement practices, including feedback loops and retrospectives.
  - Metrics and measurements relevant to Kanban, such as cycle time and lead time.
  - The role of Kanban in Agile and Lean methodologies.
  - Case studies and practical applications of Kanban in different industries.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions on unrelated Agile frameworks such as Scrum.
  - Misinterpretations of Kanban principles, such as equating it with task management tools without context.
  - Content that does not align with the original theories and philosophies of Kanban as defined by key authors and practitioners in the field.

Kanban is a strategy for change, not a tool or board. As defined in the Kanban Guide, it enables organisations to “start with what they do now,” understand their current system, and improve flow and value delivery through evolutionary change. It is rooted in Lean principles and systems thinking, focusing on how work flows rather than what work gets done.

Unlike frameworks that prescribe roles or timeboxes, Kanban introduces observability: visualising work, limiting WIP, managing flow, and making policies explicit. This exposes bottlenecks and enables evidence-based improvement without disrupting existing structures.

Kanban complements other approaches like Scrum and DevOps by improving transparency and decision-making. It does not require a reset or reorganisation. Instead, it guides teams to adapt their way of working over time, based on feedback and performance metrics such as lead time, throughput, and service-level expectations.

Crucially, Kanban is often misunderstood as just visual task tracking. But its true power lies in creating a shared understanding of system behaviour and enabling strategic decisions about where and how to improve. It empowers teams to deliver value predictably, sustainably, and with greater resilience—making it an essential strategy for navigating complex, evolving environments.
