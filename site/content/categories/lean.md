  **Use this category only for discussions on Lean.**  
  The Lean category encompasses strategies and methodologies aimed at maximising value while minimising waste, primarily derived from the principles of the Toyota Production System. This category focuses on the continuous improvement of processes, efficiency, and the elimination of non-value-adding activities.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles of Lean Thinking and its application in various industries.
  - The concept of value stream mapping and its role in identifying waste.
  - Techniques for waste reduction, including the Seven Wastes (Muda).
  - The role of continuous improvement (Kaizen) in Lean practices.
  - Lean tools and methodologies such as 5S, Just-In-Time (JIT), and Kanban.
  - The relationship between Lean and other methodologies, such as Agile and Six Sigma.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful Lean implementations.
  - The impact of Lean on organisational culture and employee engagement.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that focus solely on Agile or Scrum without reference to Lean principles.
  - Content that misinterprets Lean as merely cost-cutting or efficiency without considering value creation.
  - Topics unrelated to Lean methodologies, such as general management theories or unrelated business strategies.
