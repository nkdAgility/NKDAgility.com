description: Engineering practices that enable agility, including TDD, CI/CD, modular architecture, and emergent design.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Technical Excellence.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses engineering practices and methodologies that enhance agility within software development and delivery processes. It focuses on the principles and techniques that facilitate high-quality, efficient, and adaptive engineering practices, ensuring that teams can respond swiftly to changing requirements and deliver value consistently.

  **Key topics to be discussed under this category include:**
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD) and its role in ensuring code quality and reliability.
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) practices that streamline the deployment pipeline.
  - Modular architecture and its benefits for scalability and maintainability.
  - Emergent design principles that allow for flexibility and responsiveness to evolving project needs.
  - The integration of Agile methodologies with technical practices to foster a culture of continuous improvement.
  - The impact of technical excellence on team collaboration and overall project success.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to engineering practices, such as general Agile philosophy, team dynamics without a technical focus, or unrelated business strategies. Misinterpretations of the core classification, such as conflating technical excellence with purely managerial or operational topics, should also be avoided.
