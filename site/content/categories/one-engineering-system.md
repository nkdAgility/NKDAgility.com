Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on One Engineering System (1ES).**  
  The One Engineering System (1ES) is a comprehensive framework aimed at standardising and integrating software development practices across teams. Its purpose is to enhance collaboration, improve efficiency, and ensure high-quality software delivery by unifying tools, processes, and methodologies.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - The principles and components of the One Engineering System framework.
  - Integration of tools and processes across different teams and departments.
  - Best practices for implementing 1ES in software development environments.
  - The impact of 1ES on software quality, security, and delivery timelines.
  - Case studies or examples of successful 1ES implementations.
  - Comparisons between 1ES and other engineering frameworks or methodologies.
  - Challenges and solutions in adopting a unified engineering system.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of 1ES, such as unrelated software development methodologies, personal opinions on engineering practices, or content that does not focus on the integration and standardisation of engineering processes.
