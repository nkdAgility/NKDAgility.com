description: Scrum is a a **social technology** for building **adaptive solutions** it focuses on delivering the **highest business value** in the **shortest time**. Scrum is a **framework** that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Scrum.**  
  The Scrum category encompasses the principles, practices, and frameworks that facilitate collaborative and adaptive project management, primarily in software development. It is designed to enhance team performance and deliver maximum business value through iterative progress and continuous improvement.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The Scrum Framework: Roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), Events (Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and Artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment).
  - Agile Principles: Emphasis on customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working software frequently.
  - Empirical Process Control: The importance of transparency, inspection, and adaptation in managing complex projects.
  - Team Dynamics: Self-organisation, cross-functionality, and the significance of team collaboration and communication.
  - Continuous Improvement: Techniques for reflecting on team performance and implementing changes for better outcomes.
  - Scrum Implementation: Best practices for adopting Scrum in various organisational contexts and overcoming common challenges.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions on unrelated frameworks (e.g., Kanban, Lean, DevOps) or misinterpretations of Scrum principles that do not align with the original Scrum Guide or the philosophies of its founders.

Scrum is a **Framework** and a **social technology** for delivering **adaptive solutions** in complex environments. It is built on **empiricism**—transparency, inspection, and adaptation—and is designed to help teams deliver value iteratively and incrementally. Scrum is a **framework** that helps teams work together to solve complex problems and deliver high-value products. Its about planning.

## First Principals

1. **Empiricism**: Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.
2. **Self-Organization**: Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.
3. **Collaboration**: Scrum promotes collaboration among all roles to deliver the highest value.
4. **Value-Based Prioritization**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.
5. **Time-Boxing**: Time-boxed events are used to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
6. **Iterative Development**: Scrum uses an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
7. **Incremental Delivery**: Scrum delivers a potentially releasable product increment at the end of each Sprint.
8. **Continuous Improvement**: Scrum Teams continuously improve through the use of the Scrum Events and by inspecting and adapting the product, processes, and practices.

## Values

1. **Commitment**: The Scrum Team commits to achieving the Sprint Goal.
2. **Focus**: The Scrum Team focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
3. **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
4. **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
5. **Courage**: The Scrum Team has the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

## Accountabilities

1. **[Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})** – Consists of a **Product Owner**, **Developers**, and a **Scrum Master**. The Scrum Team is **self-managing** and works collaboratively to deliver a **usable Increment** every Sprint.
2. **[Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}})**: Accountable for **maximising product value** and managing the **Product Backlog**.
3. **Developers**: Accountable for delivering **usable Increments** that meet the Definition of Done.
4. **[Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}})**: Accountable for **Scrum effectiveness**, **causing the removal of impediments**, and **coaching the team**.

## Events

1. **Sprint**: A fixed-length iteration (≤ 1 month) in which the team creates at least one usable Increment.
2. **Sprint Planning**: Based on the Product Goal, the team plans the work for the Sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum**: Based on the Sprint Goal the Developers plan work for the next 24 hours.
4. **Sprint Review**: Based on the current state of the Product, current business conditions, and possible future business conduction the Scrum Team plans whats next.
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: The Scrum Team plan on how they will change their system to improve the next Sprint.

## Artifacts

6. **Commitments**
   - **Product Goal**: The long-term vision for the product.
   - **Sprint Goal**: A tactical objective for the Sprint.
   - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A quality standard for completed work.

### **Key Accountabilities**

Scrum is lightweight, but **difficult to master**. It is **not a process or methodology** but a **framework** that helps teams navigate complexity through **empirical process control**.
