Scrum is a framework for enabling people to organise around complex solution to adapt problems. It can be applied to the full lifecycle of the product, and it helps us stay flexible as needed by adapting to changing circumstances. Using Scrum we can more readily take advantage of opertunities, and weather surprises.
