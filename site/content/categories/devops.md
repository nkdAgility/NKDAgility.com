description: The union of people, process, and tools, to enable continuous delivery of value to the end users.
Instructions: |-
  Use this category only for discussions on DevOps as an ethos, not just a toolchain or job title.

  Scope and Purpose:
  The DevOps category is dedicated to the integration of development, operations, and business functions to drive continuous value delivery. It emphasises automation, collaboration, and feedback loops as essential components of high-performing organisations. Discussions should focus on how DevOps enables agility, reliability, and innovation at scale.

  Key Topics to Discuss:
  - DevOps as an Ethos – Understanding DevOps beyond tools, focusing on culture and collaboration.
  - CI/CD & Release Automation – Best practices for Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment.
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Managing infrastructure with tools like Terraform, Bicep, Ansible, and Pulumi.
  - Observability & Monitoring – Ensuring reliability through logs, metrics, tracing, and alerting.
  - Security as Code (DevSecOps) – Embedding security in pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment workflows.
  - Collaboration & Flow Efficiency – Breaking silos between developers, ops, security, and business teams.
  - Scaling DevOps Practices – Implementing DevOps in large enterprises, regulated industries, and complex environments.
  - Cloud & Hybrid DevOps – Managing workloads across Azure, AWS, GCP, and on-premises.
  - DevOps Case Studies & Lessons Learned – Real-world examples of DevOps transformations, success stories, and failures.
  - Tooling Discussions – Evaluating Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, ArgoCD, and other DevOps platforms.

  Ensure that discussions remain focused on DevOps as a strategic enabler of agility, quality, and resilience, rather than just technical implementations.
