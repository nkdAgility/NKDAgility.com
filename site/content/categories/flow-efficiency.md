Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Flow Efficiency.**  
  The category of Flow Efficiency focuses on optimising the throughput of work across the value stream to enhance speed and minimise bottlenecks. It is rooted in Lean and Agile philosophies, emphasising the importance of continuous improvement and the effective management of work in progress.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles of Flow Efficiency in Lean and Agile methodologies.
  - Techniques for identifying and eliminating bottlenecks in the value stream.
  - Metrics for measuring flow efficiency, such as cycle time and lead time.
  - The role of visual management tools, like Kanban boards, in enhancing flow.
  - Strategies for optimising work in progress (WIP) limits to improve throughput.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful flow efficiency implementations.
  - The impact of flow efficiency on team performance and delivery speed.
  - Integration of flow efficiency concepts with DevOps practices for continuous delivery.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the optimisation of work throughput, such as unrelated project management methodologies, general productivity tips, or misinterpretations of Lean and Agile principles.
