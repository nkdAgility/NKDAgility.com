  - Strategies for fostering a culture of agility and innovation
  - Metrics and KPIs for measuring enterprise agility
  - Change management practices in agile transformations
  - The role of leadership in driving enterprise agility
  - Integration of Agile, Lean, and DevOps practices at the organisational level

  - Discussions focused solely on team-level agile practices without organisational context
  - Misinterpretations of agility that do not align with the principles of responsiveness and adaptability
  - Content that does not address the broader implications of agility on organisational performance and culture
