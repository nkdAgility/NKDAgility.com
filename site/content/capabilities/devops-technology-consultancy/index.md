  subtitle: Design the Systems. Build the Pipelines. Empower the Teams.
  content: |
    You’ve got too many tools, too many silos, and a delivery pipeline that’s more duct tape than design.

    You don’t need another vendor pitching a silver bullet—you need a trusted partner who can help you build DevOps systems that scale, secure, and perform.

    title: Why DevOps Initiatives Fail in the Real World
    content: |
      Most DevOps initiatives stall because:

      - Teams don’t own the pipelines
      - Tools are deployed without architecture
      - Security is bolted on, not baked in
      - Delivery slows down instead of speeding up
      - Leaders can’t see flow—or fix it

      **We don’t start with tools. We start with outcomes.**

      Then we architect, automate, and enable.

      "Thanks to Martin's guidance and support we successfully upgraded Azure DevOps from and unstable database, moved our dev teams to the latest Visual Studio, and implemented the finest build process ever known!

      I would recommend Martin to anyone, in fact I would insist they use him as he is the best DevOps consultant i've worked with."

Our DevOps consultants work with organisations to help them get the most out of their DevOps strategy and maximise its effectiveness.

We conduct health checks to assess your organisation’s current State of DevOps. We meld this discovery with our experience to advise changes to the existing ways of working, culture and tooling to achieve the objectives. We design training programs to educate teams and help them change. Following training, we can coach and mentor during the next evolution as everyone works towards achieving the outcomes.

## Our DevOps Consultancy Approach

Change is evolutionary, not transformational, and for that you and your people need to understand DevOps so that you and your people can continue to evolve your organisation.

We use our knowledge and experience in evolutionary change, using the DevOps mindset and lean thinking, to help organisations achieve their outcomes. We work with leadership to identify the outcomes that they want to accomplish and train teams in the agile mindset and lean thinking. For any of the outcomes, we will work with you using [evidence-based management](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/) techniques to define how we will measure success.

Using an evidence-based mindset, along with this definition of success, we will examine the maturity and health of the organisation. This can have many different elements and almost always include Innovation Rate, On-Product Index, Usage Index, and Installed Version Index, as these key measures are known to be lacking in most organisations.

We analyse the data to understand the current state and create and adapt any recommendations tailored to the organisation. These recommended changes may include processes, practices, tools, organisational dynamics and culture. We propose short, quick, incremental changes in the journey to achieving successful outcomes. Using an iterative approach allows us the flexibility to measure success continually and change direction if needed.

Our approaches use the latest DevOps and lean practices to help you improve.
