    title: Why Business Agility Stalls in most Orgs
    content: |
      Most agile transformations focus on tools, jargon, and role changes.
      But they ignore the real constraints:

      -	Misaligned strategy and delivery
      -	Dysfunctional team structures
      -	A lack of measurable outcomes

      You don’t need more frameworks.

      You need **a partner who understands product, technology, and systems thinking.
      That’s us**.

      "Thanks to Martin's guidance and support we successfully upgraded Azure DevOps from and unstable database, moved our dev teams to the latest Visual Studio, and implemented the finest build process ever known!

      I would recommend Martin to anyone, in fact I would insist they use him as he is the best DevOps consultant i've worked with."

Our Agile consultants work with organisations to resolve problems and seize opportunities. We collaborate with leaders to identify what successful outcomes look like.

We conduct health-checks to assess the current State of Agility within your organisation. We meld this discovery with our experience to advise changes to the existing ways of working, culture and tooling to achieve the objectives. We design training programs to educate teams and help them change. Following training, we can coach and mentor during the evolution that follows as everyone works towards achieving the outcomes.

## Our Agile Consultancy Approach

We use our knowledge and experience in evolutionary change, using the agile mindset and lean thinking, to help organisations achieve their outcomes. We work with leadership to identify the outcomes that they want to accomplish and train teams in the agile mindset and lean thinking. For any of the outcomes, we will work with you using [evidence-based management](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/) techniques to define how we will measure success.

Using an evidence-based mindset, along with this definition of success, we will examine the maturity and health of the organisation. This can have many different elements and almost always include Innovation Rate, On-Product Index, Usage Index, Installed Version Index as these key measures are known to be lacking in most organisations.

We analyse all of the data to understand the current state and create and adapt any recommendations tailored to the organisation. These recommended changes may include processes, practices, tools, as well as organisational dynamics and culture. We propose short, quick, incremental changes in the journey to achieving successful outcomes. Using an iterative approach allows us the flexibility to measure success continually and change direction if needed.

Our aproaches use the latest agile and lean practices to help your improve.
