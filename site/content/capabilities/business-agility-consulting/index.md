    title: Why Business Agility Stalls in most Orgs
    content: |
      Most agile transformations focus on tools, jargon, and role changes.
      But they ignore the real constraints:

      -	Misaligned strategy and delivery
      -	Dysfunctional team structures
      -	A lack of measurable outcomes

      You don‚Äôt need more frameworks.

      You need **a partner who understands product, technology, and systems thinking.
      That‚Äôs us**.

      I would recommend Martin to anyone, in fact I would insist they use him as he is the best DevOps consultant i've worked with."
