short_title: Operating Model Design
description: Designs integrated operating models that align strategy with execution, combining Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps for measurable business outcomes and evidence-based decisions.
tldr: Many organizations fail to achieve results because their operating models do not effectively link strategy to execution. Integrating Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps as complementary practices can create a system that delivers measurable business outcomes. Consider designing your operating model with both technical and organizational expertise to ensure it is practical and evidence-based.

      title: Operating Model Design
      subtitle: Align Strategy, Discovery, Delivery, and Operations
      content: |
        Most organizations don't fail because they lack talent or technology.  
        They fail because their **operating model** is misaligned—strategy disconnected from delivery, operations fighting with engineering, and decisions made without evidence.

        **We help you design operating models that turn fragmented activity into coherent systems of work**, where technology becomes a strategic advantage rather than a constraint.

    title: What Is Operating Model Design?
    sideContent: |
      An operating model is how your organization actually works—not just your org chart, but how strategy flows into discovery, how discovery shapes delivery, and how operations enable scale.

      When these elements work together, teams move faster, make better decisions, and deliver measurable business outcomes.

      When they don't, you get silos, rework, and delivery friction.

      Without a coherent operating model, even the best frameworks fail. Scrum becomes ceremony, DevOps becomes tool sprawl, and Agile becomes theatre.
