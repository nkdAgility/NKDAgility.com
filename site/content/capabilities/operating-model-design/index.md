short_title: Operating Model Design
description: Designs integrated operating models that align strategy with execution, combining Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps for measurable business outcomes and evidence-based decisions.
tldr: Many organizations fail to achieve results because their operating models do not effectively link strategy to execution. Integrating Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps as complementary practices can create a system that delivers measurable business outcomes. Consider designing your operating model with both technical and organizational expertise to ensure it is practical and evidence-based.

      title: Operating Model Design
      subtitle: Align Strategy, Discovery, Delivery, and Operations
      content: |
        Most organisations don't fail because they lack talent or technology.  
        They fail because their operating model is misaligned, strategy disconnected from delivery, operations fighting with engineering, and decisions made without evidence.

        We design operating models that turn fragmented activity into coherent systems of work. This is consultation, design, and enablement focused on how your organisation connects strategic intent to delivery reality.

    title: What We Provide
    sideContent: |
      Operating model design is strategic consultation on how your organisation actually works, not just org charts, but how strategy flows into discovery, how discovery shapes delivery, and how operations enable scale.

      The service includes assessment, model design, practice integration, and ongoing enablement to help your organisation maintain coherence as context evolves.

    content: |
      Without a coherent operating model, even the best frameworks fail. Scrum becomes ceremony, DevOps becomes tool sprawl, and Agile becomes theatre.

          Work takes longer than expected, quality varies, and root causes remain hidden.
