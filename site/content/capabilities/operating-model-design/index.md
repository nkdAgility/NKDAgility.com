      title: Operating Model Design
      subtitle: Connect Strategy to Delivery Reality
      content: |
        Strategy disconnected from delivery. Delivery disconnected from operations. Teams working without shared context. Decisions made without evidence.

        You get a coherent system of work that connects strategic intent to execution reality. Clear visibility across discovery, delivery, and operations. Engineering economics you can see and act on. Decisions grounded in flow and evidence, not hope.

    title: What This Provides
    sideContent: |
      Strategic consultation on how your organisation actually works. Not org charts, but how strategy flows into discovery, discovery shapes delivery, and operations enable sustainable scale.

      Includes assessment, model design, practice integration, and ongoing enablement. Helps you maintain coherence as context evolves.

    title: When This Matters
    listType: boxed
    content: |
      Without a coherent operating model, frameworks become ceremony. Scrum becomes meeting theatre. DevOps becomes tool sprawl. Kanban becomes a board with sticky notes.

      - title: Strategy disconnected from teams
        icon: fa-arrows-split-up-and-left
        content: |
          Leadership sets direction, but translation to team-level work remains unclear. Goals feel abstract.
      - title: Discovery isolated from delivery
        icon: fa-people-arrows
        content: |
          Product discovery and engineering delivery operate independently. Handoffs create friction and misalignment.
      - title: Delivery slow and unpredictable
        icon: fa-road-barrier
        content: |
          Work takes longer than expected. Lead time varies wildly. Root causes stay hidden.
      - title: Technology constrains growth
        icon: fa-chain
        content: |
          Systems block change rather than enable it. Technical decisions made without business context.

      "Martin's depth and breadth of knowledge and experience of the world of Agile/DevOps is incredible. He will switch between hands on development to advanced consulting or training on process, practices and tools to help you in your own DevOps journey. When the going gets tough in challenging situations he is super responsive and goes the extra mile... He is passionate about what he does and is always trying to improve the way we work to build high value products and solutions... Down to earth and straight talking. Highly recommend!"

    listType: list
    content: |
      A global energy technology company had 27 separate DevOps systems, 800+ projects, and 900+ custom processes. Teams working on the same product used different tracking systems. Leadership had no coherent view of delivery, performance, or investment.
      
      [Operating model consolidation and standardization](/resources/case-studies/standardize-engineering-practice-across-800-teams) reduced collections from 27 to 7, unified work item tracking, enabled cross-team collaboration, and provided strategic visibility. Engineering teams could focus on delivery rather than wrestling with fragmented systems.
