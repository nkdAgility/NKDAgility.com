description: Strategic consultation on transitioning from industrial-era structures to operating models fit for dynamic markets. Creates coherent systems of work built on learning from real evidence, distributed decision-making, and continuous adaptation, enabling predictable flow and confident decision-making.
tldr: Most organisations operate under industrial-era assumptions while competing in dynamic markets. This fundamental mismatch creates waste, missed opportunities, and frustrated teams. Operating model design helps you transition to an operating model grounded in learning from reality, fast feedback, and teams with complete capability, matching the speed and uncertainty of modern markets.

      title: Operating Model Design
      subtitle: From Industrial-Era Control to Market-Speed Adaptation
      content: |
        Your organisation operates under industrial-era assumptions while competing in dynamic markets. Predictive planning in unpredictable environments. Hierarchical control where learning speed matters. Isolated departments when complete teams win.

        You get an operating model grounded in learning from real evidence, decisions made by those closest to the work, and continuous adaptation. Systems of work that match market speed. Clear visibility across discovery, delivery, and operations. Engineering economics you can see and act on. Decisions based on what actually happens, not what you hoped would happen.

    title: What This Provides
    sideContent: |
      Strategic consultation on transitioning from Industrial Operating Model assumptions to an operating model fit for dynamic markets.

      Not frameworks imposed from the outside. Your operating model grounded in learning from reality, designed for fast feedback, structured around complete teams, and built for continuous simplification.

      Includes assessment of core business assumptions, model design, practice integration, and ongoing enablement as your context evolves.

    title: The Fundamental Mismatch
    listType: boxed
    content: |
      Most organisations operate under an Industrial Operating Model built for predictable markets: efficiency, standardization, control. This worked brilliantly when demand changed slowly and product lifecycles measured in decades. Today, markets are dynamic. Customer needs evolve rapidly. Competitors emerge quickly. The mismatch between industrial-era assumptions and market reality generates massive waste.
    list:
      - title: Planning waste
        icon: fa-calendar-xmark
        content: |
          Months creating detailed plans that become obsolete within weeks. Requirements gathered at the start no longer reflect market reality by delivery time.
      - title: Decision-making waste
        icon: fa-triangle-exclamation
        content: |
          Hierarchical approval chains delay action. By the time decisions escalate through management layers, information is stale and opportunities have passed.
      - title: Innovation waste
        icon: fa-lightbulb-slash
        content: |
          Rigid processes and risk-averse cultures kill experimentation. Ideas must fit predetermined roadmaps. Small experiments are blocked by governance designed for large capital investments.
      - title: Speed mismatch
        icon: fa-gauge-simple-low
        content: |
          Markets iterate daily. Organisations plan quarterly. Customer needs evolve continuously. Organisations deliver in large batches after months. This structural incompatibility stems from outdated business assumptions.

      A global energy technology company had 27 separate DevOps systems, 800+ projects, and 900+ custom processes. Teams working on the same product used different tracking systems. Leadership had no coherent view of delivery, performance, or investment.
      
      [Operating model consolidation and standardization](/resources/case-studies/standardize-engineering-practice-across-800-teams) reduced collections from 27 to 7, unified work item tracking, enabled cross-team collaboration, and provided strategic visibility. Engineering teams could focus on delivery rather than wrestling with fragmented systems.
