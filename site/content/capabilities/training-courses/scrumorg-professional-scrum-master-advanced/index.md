  - The Scrum Master as a Teacher
  - The Scrum Master as a Coach & Mentor
  - The Scrum Master as a Facilitator
  - The Scrum Master as a Change Agent

  <!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  As a Scrum Master, being able to identify, and effectively apply, which stance would benefit your team the most depending on the situation or circumstance could prove to be the key to the success of your team.  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  As a Scrum Master, part of your role is to help management and other stakeholders across your organization understand the benefits of Scrum and Agile. Therefore, it is imperative that you have the information and background that is needed to gain credibility in order to be an effective change agent.  Throughout the class, Martin will provide stories, exercises, facilitation techniques (such as “Liberating Structures”), resources and more.  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->  There will also be a time in class for Martin to provide coaching on challenges that you and your classmates may be experiencing today or may in the future.  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

The Professional Scrum Master II (PSM-A) course is a 2-day advanced Scrum Master class designed to support Scrum Masters in their professional development.  The PSM II course is intended for Scrum Masters with at least one year of experience who are looking to grow their knowledge and abilities as a Scrum Master. This course is one step in that journey. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognized [Professional Scrum Master II (PSM II) certification](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-ii-certification) exam.

Unlike the [Professional Scrum Master (PSM) course](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master/) which focuses on how to use Scrum, the Scrum framework and the role of the Scrum Master, PSM-A is an advanced course helping students to understand the stances that characterize an effective Scrum Master and servant-leader while diving deep into how they serve the Development Team, Product Owner and organization. The course then teaches students about related practices and skills to enable them to have the right types of conversations and how to apply them to become better Scrum Masters.
