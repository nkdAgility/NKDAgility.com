    "reasoning": "There are no direct references to scaling frameworks, methodologies, or cross-team coordination. The course focuses on advanced Scrum Master topics such as servant leadership, conflict resolution, and change management, intended for single-team leadership. While organizational change and some topics like stakeholder engagement touch tangentially on broader impact, they do not specifically address the core complexities of scaling (multiple teams, dependency management, alignment across enterprise, etc.). Learning outcomes and course content remain anchored in advanced practice at the team/Scrum Master level, not scaling theory or frameworks.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is centered on advanced Scrum Master practices for single teams, not on scaling frameworks or cross-team delivery. It does not address core scaling topics or challenges, making its fit with the Scaling category low.",

    "reasoning": "The course is targeted at Scrum Masters and covers advanced scrum practices and leadership, focusing on facilitation, conflict resolution, and metrics use. However, it does not explicitly discuss or reference Agentic Engineering, nor does it meaningfully address maximizing human and AI agency, ethical AI integration, or decentralized engineering practices. Themes such as servant leadership and change agency are tangentially related but lack explicit focus on agentic frameworks. There is minimal discussion of engineering as a discipline or philosophical aspects of agency. The strongest alignment is with the practitioner audience and relevance to organizational change agents, but the primary content is Scrum mastery, not Agentic Engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This advanced Scrum Master course emphasizes leadership and facilitation but does not explicitly engage with Agentic Engineering concepts like maximizing agency or integrating AI. Its main focus is Scrum practice improvement, with limited philosophical or engineering design perspective.",
