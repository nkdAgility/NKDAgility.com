There are no direct mentions of Current Value, Evidence-Based Management, or related metrics. Conceptually, the course is focused on general Scrum practices rather than the assessment or measurement of value delivered, let alone real-time value feedback. There is a slight tangential link in discussing driving value as a Product Owner, but this is general and does not reference measurement, indicators, or decision-making based on Current Value. The depth of discussion on EBM or Current Value is negligible, as the intent is basic training on roles, process, and collaboration, not outcome/value metrics. The audience is Product Owners and related roles, which marginally overlaps with the intended audience of Current Value content, but the signal-to-noise ratio is low regarding this category. No penalties were triggered as the material is neither outdated nor critical toward EBM concepts.",

There are no direct references or substantive discussions aligning with the Current Value category.",
