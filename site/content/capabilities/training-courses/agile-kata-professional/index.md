The current track record of agile transformations is not very promising. 75% of all agile transformations fail to achieve their goals and therefore missing out on the huge positive impact it has on employee engagement, customer satisfaction, operational performance and time-to-market (McKinsey 2022). Is it because companies see Agile as a business process update and not as a cultural shift?

Is Business Agility a huge buzzword in your organization, which is difficult to break down into digestible pieces? Or, are your existing agile teams looking for new ways of triggering organizational change or looking for a new way of working? The list of challenges can be long.

On a team-level, the Agile Kata can infuse new energy and ideas to existing agile teams that are looking to improve their existing agile process. Some teams, that are looking for alternatives to Scrum or Kanban, can use the Agile Kata also as their team process.

The Agile Kata is versatile and can provide answers to these common questions and challenges. It combines a proven practice, which has been applied for decades in lean manufacturing, with a clear alignment to agile values and principles. See how scientific thinking and practical hands-on application work well together in this 1-day course.
