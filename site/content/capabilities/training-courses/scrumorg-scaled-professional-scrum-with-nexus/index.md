The Scaled Professional Scrum is a hands-on, activity-based course where students develop a collection of skills that can be applied to overcome challenges when scaling Scrum. Even after achieving success with Scrum, teams are still limited by the amount of work they can do and the value they can create. They need to expand, or scale, to a group of Scrum Teams working together on the same product. When doing so, they often encounter common challenges with cross-team dependencies, self-management, transparency and accountability.

When introducing heavy-weight scaling methodologies, teams often find that the added overhead slows down the teams and distracts from the essence and benefits of Scrum. Instead, the Nexus Framework minimally extended the Scrum Framework to include ways that help solve the dependency and collaboration challenges of cross-team work. Since Nexus enhances the foundational elements of Scrum, it reinforces the benefits of Scrum while also being familiar to those that have used Scrum.

The Scaled Professional Scrum™ (SPS) with Nexus course, builds on the Nexus framework by introducing complementary practices and techniques proven to help teams scale. The course also includes a free attempt at the globally recognised Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS) certification exam.

Our training is delivered as an interactive, activity-based course over half-day sessions using Microsoft Teams, and Mural. Students work together in a Nexus to organise and simulate a scaled product development project. This case study-based class presents common challenges in scaling and more than fifty practices for overcoming them are revealed. Students will develop an understanding of how to launch, structure, organise, and manage a large Agile project using Scrum. They will leave the class with a toolbox of techniques for identifying and overcoming common scaling challenges. Between sessions, we provide additional reading, writing, and watching activities to maximise the learning opportunities and complement the classroom experience.

- Session 1: Scaling Scrum & Organising Teams
- Session 2: Team Selection & Organising Work
- Session 3: Nexus in Action
- Session 4: Managing the Nexus

After the conclusion of the class, we provide access to a community of peers and continued access to the trainer through office hours, quarterly catchups, and constant engagement. To maximise validated learning, all students are given a password to take the SPS assessment, and if they take it within 14 days and are unsuccessful, they will be granted a second attempt. As part of our validated learning experience, we provide a 30-minute learning review, a 1h coaching session, and access to future courses at a 30% discount on future classes.
