It references 'Kanban principles,' 'core practices,' WIP limits, and metrics, but does not explicitly discuss or identify first principles as defined (i.e., irreducible, immutable truths or constraints).

The learning outcomes and topics clearly align with Kanban and agile philosophies. No penalties were applied since the material is current, not satirical or critical, and targets relevant agile practitioners.
