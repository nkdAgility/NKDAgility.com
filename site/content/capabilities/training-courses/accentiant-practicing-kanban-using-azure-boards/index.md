audience:
  overview: This course is appropriate for all members of a software development team, especially those who are actively involved with creating and refining a product backlog as well as planning and executing the work. This course will also provide value for individuals outside the development team (managers, Scrum Masters, coaches, and other stakeholders) who are interested in establishing and improving flow for their team. Even teams currently practicing Scrum should consider attending this course, as Kanban is a great complementary practice for managing and improving their flow.
