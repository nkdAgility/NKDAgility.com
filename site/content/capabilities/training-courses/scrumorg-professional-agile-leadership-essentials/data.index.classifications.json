While the workshop promises development of practical skills, the details remain conceptual, centered on frameworks, culture, leadership theory, and Agile transformation rather than thorough tutorials or focused exploration of concrete practices (e.g., TDD, Retrospectives). Mentions of 'practice' are general, not explicit or detailed. The intent is supportive for leaders and managers (audience alignment), but content depth relative to Practice is moderate and indirect. Most of the material aligns better with Agile leadership or organizational change rather than specific Practice topics.",

Discussion of value is present but does not explore latent or unrealised value, strategies for uncovering these, or related frameworks. The audience matches Agile leaders and managers, which is partially aligned with EBM interests, and the content maintains relevance for this segment.

There are no explicit mentions of 'Definition of Workflow' or any of its key topics: the course topics and learning outcomes focus on leadership, value delivery, organizational culture, professionalism, Agile transformation, and scaling Agile, but do not discuss the flow of work, WIP limits, workflow policies, entry/exit criteria, or Kanban principles. Audience is well-aligned (Agile leaders and practitioners), but there is little to no content focused on workflow definition policy, nor depth on this subject. The signal-to-noise ratio is moderately high since the content remains generally relevant to Agile contexts; however, its lack of focus on the category drops the overall confidence significantly. No penalties apply, as information is current, not contrary to the category, and presented in a neutral manner.",
