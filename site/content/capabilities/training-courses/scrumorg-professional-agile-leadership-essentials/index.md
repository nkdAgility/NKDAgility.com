      title: "Transform Your Organisation Through Agile Leadership"
      content: |
        You're responsible for leading agile adoption, but you're facing resistance, confusion about roles, and teams that aren't delivering the value you need. You need the confidence to guide your organisation through transformation, make strategic decisions about agility investments, and create conditions where teams can thrive. This course gives you deep understanding of how agility works, practical leadership techniques you can apply immediately, and the ability to measure and communicate the impact of your agile initiatives — not just theory, but capability you'll use from day one.

      Martin Hinshelwood brings over 20 years of technical and organisational transformation experience to this Scrum.org course. You'll benefit from real-world stories, practical examples from actual engagements, and technical depth that goes beyond generic agile theory.
      
      **Immersive Learning Format**: Our default delivery is 7 weekly 2-hour sessions with offline assignments between sessions. You'll apply concepts to your real organisational challenges, bring results back for discussion, and build lasting capability through spaced repetition and practical application. This format creates better outcomes than traditional 2-day intensives.
      
      **Traditional Format Available**: For organisations requiring faster delivery, we offer a condensed 2-day format. While less time for real-world application between sessions, it still includes hands-on exercises and Martin's practical insights.
      
      **Small Class Sizes**: Better interaction, personalisation, and opportunity to discuss your specific challenges.
