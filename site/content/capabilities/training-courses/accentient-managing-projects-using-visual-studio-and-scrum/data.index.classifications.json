The curriculum includes team-based exercises, hands-on application, and mentions specific practices repeatedly (e.g., sprint planning, backlog creation). However, usage of Visual Studio and reporting tools introduces some tool-focused content that, while contextualized in practice, partially dilutes the focus. There is substantial depth, with numerous individual techniques taught in an applied environment. Some course topics reference frameworks or tools, but the main thrust remains the adoption and practical application of Scrum practices in team settings.",

The intent is to teach practical applications, not to examine the underlying convictions or systemic behaviors that the Ethos category requires.
