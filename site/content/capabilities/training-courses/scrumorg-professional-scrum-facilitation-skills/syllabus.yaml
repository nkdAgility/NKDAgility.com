  title: "Introduction and Setting the Stage"
  duration: 120
  content: |
    **Welcome and Icebreaker:** Kick off the class with introductions and an interactive icebreaker (e.g. an "Introduction Carousel"), allowing students to connect with each other and the course topic in a fun way.
    
    **Establish a Safe Environment:** Co-create a team working agreement to set ground rules and foster psychological safety, ensuring a **safe learning space** for open participation. Emphasize that facilitation techniques will be used throughout the class and encourage a supportive atmosphere.
    
    **Experiencing Facilitation Early:** Demonstrate facilitation in action from the start. Students participate in creative **Liberating Structures** exercises such as *"Worst Possible Idea" (a variant of Triz)* and *"1-2-4-All"* to surface ideas collaboratively. Debrief how these techniques encourage participation and collective creativity, setting the tone for an interactive course.

    content: |
      Practice establishing psychological safety in your next team interaction by co-creating a working agreement or team charter.
    examples: |
      - Facilitate a session with your team to establish ground rules for meetings
      - Lead a working agreement creation exercise for a new project kickoff
      - Modify an existing team charter to include psychological safety elements
      - Practice the "Introduction Carousel" icebreaker technique with colleagues

  title: "Facilitation Principles and Scrum"
  duration: 120
  content: |
    **Defining Great Facilitation:** Through a group activity, students share perspectives on what good facilitation looks like. Using a **1-2-4-All** exercise (with dot voting to refine results), the class collaboratively formulates a definition of great facilitation.
    
    **Facilitation in Scrum – Myth vs Fact:** A facilitated Myth-or-Fact quiz dispels misconceptions about the facilitator's role in Scrum. Students debate statements like "A facilitator can also be a participant in the discussion" – prompting discussion about neutrality and Scrum Master involvement.
    
    **Observing Team Dynamics:** Students watch the "**Dodgy Daily Scrum**" (a video of a poorly run Daily Scrum) and **observe behaviors** and issues. They note problems (e.g. one-sided conversation, lack of focus on Sprint Goal) and discuss what went wrong.
    
    **Core Facilitation Principles:** Introduction to five **facilitation principles** – *Participatory, Healthy conflict, Transparency, Process focus, and Purposeful* facilitation. These principles are explained in Scrum terms and students learn **why each principle matters** in guiding Scrum events towards outcomes.
    
    **Applying Principles to Scrum Events:** Students apply the core principles to the Daily Scrum issues identified earlier. They brainstorm how each principle could address or prevent those undesirable behaviors.
    
    **Scrum Events and "Signals" Exercise:** Teams each take a different Scrum event and **refresh** its purpose and typical flow. They identify key "signals" or indicators during the event that facilitation might be needed. The class then does a **gallery walk** to share insights.

    title: "Scrum Event Assessment and Improvement"
    content: |
      Choose one Scrum event in your organization and assess it using the five facilitation principles. Create an improvement plan based on your observations.
    examples: |
      - Observe a Daily Scrum and identify which facilitation principles are missing or weak
      - Assess a Sprint Retrospective for participatory decision-making opportunities
      - Evaluate a Sprint Planning session for transparency and process focus
      - Create a facilitation plan for an upcoming Sprint Review
      - Document "signals" that indicate when facilitation is needed in your team's events

  title: "Applying Facilitation Skills and Techniques"
  duration: 120
  content: |
    **Facilitator Skills and Traits:** Students explore the **core skills of an effective facilitator** (about a dozen skills/traits). In small groups, they consider each skill (e.g. active listening, neutrality, time management, conflict navigation) and discuss what could go wrong if a facilitator lacks that skill.
    
    **Inclusive Techniques – White Elephant Exercise:** Students experience a participatory decision-making technique first-hand. The class is given a facilitation scenario and asked to **order a set of items** by importance using the **"White Elephant" method**. Through this facilitated scenario, students **practice balancing voices** so that all opinions are heard.
    
    **Divergent and Convergent Thinking:** Introduction to concepts from Sam Kaner's model – how groups **diverge** (generate a wide range of ideas) and then **converge** (narrow toward decisions). Students learn that many facilitation techniques have divergent or convergent steps, and that both are necessary for healthy group decisions.
    
    **The "Groan Zone":** Students are introduced to the **"Groan Zone"** – the challenging phase in group dialogue where misunderstanding and frustration often occur before clarity emerges. They learn that it's **expected and even desirable** – working through the groan zone leads to stronger, well-vetted outcomes.
    
    **Navigating Team Dynamics:** Students learn practical ways a facilitator can **navigate the groan zone** and leverage diverse viewpoints. Tips and techniques are shared for guiding teams through difficult discussions – for example, encouraging quiet voices, using structured methods to organize thoughts, or pausing for reflection when tension rises.

    title: "Facilitation Technique Practice"
    content: |
      Practice using the White Elephant technique or another inclusive facilitation method in a real team scenario. Observe and document the results.
    examples: |
      - Use White Elephant technique for prioritizing team backlog items or impediments
      - Facilitate a divergent thinking session (brainstorming) followed by convergent thinking (prioritization)
      - Practice navigating through a "groan zone" moment in a team discussion
      - Apply active listening techniques during a team conflict resolution session
      - Use structured methods to ensure all voices are heard in a team decision

  title: "Improving Facilitation Skills and Course Wrap-up"
  duration: 120
  content: |
    **Personal Improvement Plan:** Students focus on **continuing their facilitation journey** beyond the class. Each participant creates a concrete action plan for applying and improving their facilitation skills. Using a tool like the *Facilitation Improvement Canvas*, they outline specific actions: for example, which upcoming Scrum event they will facilitate, which technique they'll try, and how they'll gather feedback.
    
    **Commitment to Practice:** Students are encouraged to set personal goals (e.g. "In the next Sprint Retrospective, I will use 1-2-4-All to include quieter team members") and possibly share these with a peer for accountability. The intent is to reinforce that facilitation is a skill developed through **ongoing practice and reflection**.
    
    **Course Conclusion and Feedback:** The class ends with a reflective **closing session**. The instructor recaps all the facilitation techniques experienced during the day – often using a fun "**Facilitation Bingo**" card that students have been marking whenever a new technique was introduced. Finally, a feedback exercise is conducted *using a facilitation technique* to reinforce the learning one last time. For example, the group might do a **"Perfection Game"** retrospective on the class – each student rates the class and notes what they liked and what would make it perfect.
