    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on facilitation skills for Scrum teams, with no direct or indirect mention of scaling, multi-team coordination, or enterprise-level alignment. Course learning outcomes, audience, and topics are aimed at improving team-level collaboration, not strategies for scaling Agile. There are no references to scaling frameworks, methods for cross-team interaction, or managing dependencies across teams. While the audience could overlap with those interested in scaling, the material is unrelated to the unique challenges and methodologies involved in scaling Agile beyond a single team context. Signal-to-noise is low for the Scaling category, as content remains squarely in team-level facilitation.",

While these touch on aspects of human agency and decentralized decision-making, there is no explicit mention or in-depth discussion of Agentic Engineering concepts such as engineering-driven autonomy, DevOps, engineering practices that maximize human and AI agency, systemic observability, or ethical AI integration. The intent is tangentially supportive (empowerment via facilitation), audience overlap is present, but the content doesn't explicitly or deeply address the deliberate design of engineering practices with agentic framing.",
