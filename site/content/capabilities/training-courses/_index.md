      Our trainers are all accredited from Scrum.org, ProKanban.org, or Accentient and have the expertise backing it through long experience in delivering valuable outcomes to customers through an immersive learning philosophy.

      The trainer will facilitate a team-based collaborative learning experience that is designed by some of the best minds in Agility & DevOps to plant the seeds of an agile mindset and tackle some of the hard questions. 

      The courseware is designed to elicit conversations between participants on the hard truths of moving from traditional management practices to empirical management practices. Special attention is paid to the known and common misunderstandings of agility as well as the ideas that are usually swept away under the pressures of “how we do things here”.

      To learn and adapt together it is important that all relevant levels of the organisation participate in the same training, as the realisations are profound. All organisations are different in terms of which ways of working are effective for them. Our training will help your people explore those options in an environment within which it is safe to fail.
