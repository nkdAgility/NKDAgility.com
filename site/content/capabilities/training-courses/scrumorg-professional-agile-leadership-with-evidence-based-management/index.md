introduction: 
overview: |-
  PAL-EBM is for professionals in leadership roles (including executives, managers, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, coaches, and consultants) who: 
  - Are responsible for the success of their product delivery programs or Agile transformations and are seeking a means to measure and demonstrate that success
  - Are looking for a framework that identifies improvement areas that increase their business agility, including their time to pivot to meet new challenges and deliver customer value
  - Want to help their organization embrace empiricism and experimentation to find solutions for complex problems (where more is unknown than known or the situation changes rapidly)
  - Want to articulate goals and measures in a way that fosters self-management and empower their teams to understand the connection between their work and the value their organization is providing and customer is receiving
  - Want to be more effective in how they measure success by using Agile measures rather than traditional measurement models (including the use of velocity) Attendees should have read the Evidence-

   Based Management Guide, have an understanding of Agile practices and a desire to move away from traditional, (plan-driven,) ways of working and measurement models, however, they do not need specific experience with Scrum. Our Professional Agile Leadership- Essentials course helps leaders understand how to best support their Agile teams and is ideal preparation for PAL-EBM, but is not a prerequisite. Our Professional Scrum Product Owner and Professional Scrum Product Owner - Advanced courses teach Product Owners how to deliver value and can be a great complement to the PAL-EBM course
outcomes: |-
  <!-- wp:paragraph -->  In the Professional Agile Leadership™ – Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM) one day\* course, participants learn what EBM is and how to apply it through hands-on, activity-based learning. Through a series of exercises participants learn techniques that support a more agile mindset:  <!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->
  - Use empiricism to set and achieve strategic goals, managing the unknown and complexity through experimentation and by adapting goals along the way
  - Create a cultural environment using clear goals, appropriate measures and trust to enable self-management and autonomy
  - Shift the conversation away from measuring progress purely through team performance metrics, toward a focus on customer-centricity and improving customer outcomes
  - Drive operational improvements by using four Key Value Areas (Unrealized Value, Current Value, Time-to-Market, and the Ability to Innovate) as lenses for evidence-based decision-making

assessment: 
objectives: |2+

  - Understand the essential aspects of goals and measures and how they influence behaviors and an organization’s culture and values
  - Help organizations embrace empiricism as a leadership approach. Using experimentation to incrementally steer toward the organization’s goals
  - An appreciation for how goals and trust act together to enable autonomy, transparency, and value delivery
  - Correlate market leadership and sustainability to curiosity, adaptation, and empiricism
  - Understand how to use EBM and its KVAs to focus measurements on improving market value and operational capabilities

prerequisites: |+
  Course attendees do not need experience or knowledge of Scrum, though a connection to the various aspects of Scrum (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, empiricism) is made. Ideally, the attendees will have familiarity with Agile principles and are proponents of using Agile methods at their organization. For the best outcome of the class I recommended that you read: 
  - Read: [The Evidence-Based Management Guide](https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/)
  - Read: [Investing for Business Agility: Using evidence-based portfolio management to achieve better business outcomes](https://nkdagility.com/investing-for-business-agility-using-evidence-based-portfolio-management-to-achieve-better-business-outcomes/)
