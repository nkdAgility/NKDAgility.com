title: Advanced Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO-A) Course with Certification
author: MrHinsh
delivery:
  audience: |-
    This course is designed for Product Owners, Product Managers, and Business Analysts focusing heavily on Product Management skills, tools, techniques, and knowledge as part of their work on the Scrum Team. The course does not address the Scrum framework (much), and we assume people have a proper understanding of the Scrum framework. Participants should have at least one year of experience as a Product Owner or Product Manager, while multiple years of experience and having attended the <a title="Professional Scrum Product Owner™ Training" href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-product-owner-pspo-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee883da3-2d82-4d22-9e9d-e278b071bd61">Professional Scrum Product Owner</a> course and passing <a title="Professional Scrum Product Owner™ I" href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-product-owner-i-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ffddabd4-a3f9-4f6d-ab0b-b28ef3d119fc">PSPO </a>is preferred, but not mandatory.

    The Product Owner's role is multifaceted, requiring the practitioner to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum Framework. This course surfaces these behaviours by challenging the student to adopt several different Product Owner stances:
    <ul>
     	<li><strong>Customer Representative</strong> - focused on understanding customer problems, challenges and potential opportunities</li>
     	<li><strong>Visionary</strong> - communicating the vision, future state and possibilities in ways that foster a common understanding</li>
     	<li><strong>Experimenter</strong> - focusing on innovation, hypothesis testing and validating potential value to spark product innovation</li>
     	<li><strong>Influencer</strong> - communicating with and influencing stakeholders, customers and the Scrum Team to act with a common purpose</li>
     	<li><strong>Collaborator</strong> - seeking input, ideas and feedback from others</li>
     	<li><strong>Decision Maker</strong> - focusing on creating maximum impact by making clear choices and decisions</li>
    </ul>
    Over the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Product Owner and through a series of exercises combined with instruction, students gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of the organization.
