    In this 14h, delivered over four half-days, students will gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of their organization. Through a case study-based series of exercises, combined with instruction, students gain the entrepreneurial product leadership skills and practices critical to growing as a successful Product Owner. The Product Owner role is multifaceted, requiring them to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum framework. Students explore these techniques and how to pivot among them by exploring several Product Owner "stances" including: 
    - The Customer Representative:
        - Focus on understanding customer problems, pains and opportunities
        - Get into the mindset of the customer, placing yourself in their world, understanding their needs
        - Deliver value by connecting product features to customer outcomes
    - The Visionary:
        - Champion the future state, possibilities, goals and chances
        - Communicate the product vision, strategy and Product Goal
        - Understand value and pricing models
    - The Experimenter:
        - Focus on innovation through experiments, hypotheses, tests, learnings, data and validation of value
        - Understand the Product Owner’s role in a scaled environment
    - The Decision Maker:
        - Focus on making better decisions
        - Navigate conflicting customer feedback
    - The Collaborator:
        - Seek collaboration with stakeholders and the Scrum Team
        - Work beyond the Scrum Team including contracts, finance, budgeting and governance in an agile way
    - The Influencer:
        - Lead the stakeholders, customers and Scrum Team, to move in the right direction and to change their minds, when necessary
        - Learn how to create a stakeholder management strategy

    The Product Owner's role is multifaceted, requiring the practitioner to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum Framework. This course surfaces these behaviours by challenging the student to adopt several different Product Owner stances: 
    - **Customer Representative** - focused on understanding customer problems, challenges and potential opportunities
    - **Visionary** - communicating the vision, future state and possibilities in ways that foster a common understanding
    - **Experimenter** - focusing on innovation, hypothesis testing and validating potential value to spark product innovation
    - **Influencer** - communicating with and influencing stakeholders, customers and the Scrum Team to act with a common purpose
    - **Collaborator** - seeking input, ideas and feedback from others
    - **Decision Maker** - focusing on creating maximum impact by making clear choices and decisions

     Over the 2 days, students will learn about areas critical to growing as a successful Product Owner and through a series of exercises combined with instruction, students gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of the organization.
