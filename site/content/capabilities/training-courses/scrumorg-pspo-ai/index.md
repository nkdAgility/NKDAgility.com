      title: Your competitors are already using AI to make faster product decisions
      content: |
        While you're still doing customer research manually, they're using AI to surface insights in minutes. While you're waiting on stakeholder feedback, they're synthesising sentiment instantly. While you're drafting user stories, they're prototyping and validating assumptions. Every week without AI capability widens the gap.

    title: Why this works when other AI training doesn't
    sideContent: |
      Most AI training dumps theory and leaves you paralysed. This builds confidence through practice with real tools, real product challenges, and real constraints you face.
    list:
      - content: '**You apply AI tools immediately**: No theory dumps, use tools from minute one'
      - content: "**Real product challenges**: Face decisions you'll encounter in your actual work"
      - content: "**Reusable techniques**: Leave with methods you'll use Monday morning"
      - content: '**20+ years pattern recognition**: Martin connects theory to messy reality'
      - content: '**Ethical guardrails built in**: Avoid mistakes without slowing down'
  - type: quote
    id: bottleneck-insight
    quote: |
      The bottleneck isn't knowledge about AI. It's **confidence to use it without looking incompetent or making costly mistakes**. This removes that constraint.
