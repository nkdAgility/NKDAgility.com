## Learning approach and class project

- **Exercise‑first pedagogy** – the course begins each topic with hands‑on practice or team‑based exploration before any supporting theory. Learners capture their expectations on post‑its, maintain a learning board for “aha!” moments and use AI tools for video generation, use‑case brainstorming, prompt‑library building, tool matching and podcast simulation. This approach builds confidence through discovery and reflection.

- **NeoWagen IC.x case** – participants work as Product Owners for the in‑car experience of NeoWagen’s electric‑vehicle line. The case description explains that NeoWagen’s IC.x series, launched in 2019, became a major revenue driver but now faces fierce competition, supply‑chain disruptions and technological hurdles. Improving the in‑car experience has become a differentiator in the EV market, and participants are tasked with defining and prioritizing AI‑driven improvements to reclaim market leadership. Exercises include generating an AI‑driven welcome video, profiling customers, creating a vision using the 3×3 framework, prototyping a website, prioritizing features, conducting stakeholder interviews, crafting a marketing promo and automating email responses.

- **AI as a power tool & colleague** – the trainer guide emphasises an **“AI as a power tool”** metaphor: AI augments a Product Owner’s capability rather than replacing it. Learners are encouraged to consider AI tools as colleagues with specialised skills (e.g., ChatGPT for writing, Midjourney for design, Miro AI for analysis) and to assign the right tool to each task【1095†1095-L1109】. Prompt engineering is taught via reusable prompt structures (Role, Goal, Context, Format, Constraints, Quality criteria, Iteration hook), encouraging participants to build a prompt library.

## The seven preferred stances and how AI amplifies each

The course explores seven stances that great Product Owners adopt. AI tools are positioned as force‑multipliers for each stance. Key take‑aways from the reference guide are summarised below.

| Stance                        | How it’s applied in the course                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | AI‑enhanced insights & marketing angles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customer Representative**   | Focus on understanding customer problems, values and opportunities. Participants generate personas and visualise customers’ values using AI, then present insights attractively.                                                                    | Customer understanding is a Product Owner’s superpower; personas are hypotheses needing validation, and AI helps visualise but should not replace human contact. Marketing content can emphasise empathy, multi‑dimensional customer value and the ability to simulate user personas to inspire real conversations.                                                              |
| **Visionary**                 | Use the **3×3 vision framework** to craft a compelling product story: status quo, observations, story, insight, opportunity, analogy, solution, advantages and ethos. AI tools assist with storytelling and visuals.                                | Great Product Owners bring clarity in complexity. AI supports structure and visualisation but the PO remains the storyteller. Marketing messaging can highlight how the course teaches storytelling techniques that align teams and inspire stakeholders.                                                                                                                        |
| **Experimenter**              | Validate assumptions rapidly with AI tools like ChatGPT or Bolt.new. Participants create lean experiments, generate market insights and build a mock‑up website to test ideas.                                                                      | Experimentation reduces risk and accelerates learning. Generative AI enables rapid prototyping and testing without a development team. Marketing can stress that attendees will gain hands‑on skills to de‑risk innovation and avoid vanity projects.                                                                                                                            |
| **Decision Maker**            | Use AI tools (e.g., Miro/Mural AI) to analyse and prioritise feature requests based on business value, feasibility and user impact.                                                                                                                 | AI‑supported analysis surfaces value‑driving insights, reduces bias and accelerates product decisions while still requiring human judgment. Marketing content can position AI as a co‑pilot that brings clarity and confidence to prioritisation.                                                                                                                                |
| **Collaborator & Influencer** | Capture and summarise stakeholder conversations using AI, conduct sentiment analysis and craft stakeholder influence strategies. Exercises include generating marketing promos and applications using AI.                                           | AI scales influence by auto‑generating summaries, videos and apps for diverse audiences. Marketing material can highlight how AI helps Product Owners become persuasive communicators and synthesise diverse perspectives.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Orchestrator (new!)**       | Automate routine tasks and reclaim time. Participants delegate email responses to AI and explore AI‑agent concepts for writing draft user stories.                                                                                                  | AI frees Product Owners to focus on high‑impact work by handling repetitive tasks. The course also introduces the idea of AI agents that transform user feedback into draft backlog items. Marketing can paint a picture of personal productivity gains and a future where AI manages operational load.                                                                          |
| **Security & Ethics**         | Discuss ethical risks (misinformation, bias, hallucination), privacy, transparency, data consent and environmental impact. Participants evaluate fact‑or‑myth statements, reflect on data privacy, bias awareness, transparency and accountability. | Attendees learn that prompts and outputs are securely processed in the provider’s cloud, but governance and policies remain the bigger security factors. The hidden environmental cost of AI (energy, water and carbon) is highlighted, reinforcing responsible prompting. Marketing content can stress the course’s emphasis on responsible AI use and environmental awareness. |

## Additional insights, metaphors & quotable lines for marketing

- **AI as a strategic partner** – the introduction stresses that AI is not just another tool; it’s a collaborator that supports decision‑making, customer insights and product innovation. Product Owners must lead, not just follow, the AI transformation【1095†1095-L1114】.

- **Prompt engineering guidance** – the reference guide likens prompting to briefing a new colleague; vague prompts lead to vague outputs, whereas context‑rich prompts produce relevant results. Good‑practice prompts include the role, goal, context, task & output format, constraints/tone, quality criteria and an iteration hook. These guidelines can be repurposed into marketing tips or training teasers.

- **Environmental awareness** – generating a single AI image can consume the same energy as fully charging a smartphone and uses significant amounts of water. Responsible prompting is encouraged, positioning the course as mindful of sustainability.

- **Safety & data privacy** – professional AI tools encrypt data in transit and at rest and don’t use prompts for training in paid versions, but free accounts may expose data. The real exposure lies in organizational governance and policies. Marketing can reassure prospects about secure AI usage while underscoring the need for good practices.

- **Memorable quotes** – the guides contain several quotable lines that can be woven into marketing copy:
  - “Solve real problems. People don’t argue the cost of a fire hose when their house is on fire”【1095†1095-L1103】 – emphasising value over cost.
  - “Big ideas almost always come in small words” – a reminder that simple narratives resonate.
  - “The one test of innovation is the value it brings us; anything else is just… showing off” – tying experimentation to value creation.
  - “The Internet is a reliable system comprised of loosely connected and imperfect parts that works because nobody is in control” – highlighting collaborative systems and emergent order.
  - “If you don’t use a paid subscription, then you are the product. If you use a paid subscription, the AI tool is the product” – a witty line for ethics/security messaging.
  - “Drug dealers and software developers are the only people who call their customers ‘users’” – an attention‑grabbing statement that can introduce discussions about customer empathy.
  - “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” – signposting personal growth in adopting AI.

## Implications for marketing content

1. **Position AI as an essential capability, not a fad.** Use statistics and quotes to show that most organizations already use generative AI and that product management is inherently tied to AI. Evoke urgency with analogies (e.g., AI as electricity) and challenge potential attendees to keep pace with a rapidly evolving landscape.

2. **Emphasise hands‑on learning and immediate applicability.** Highlight that the course uses a realistic EV case, encourages experimentation and provides participants with a prompt library, prototypes and AI‑generated artifacts they can reuse in their jobs. Stress the exercise‑first approach and the confidence it builds.

3. **Showcase comprehensive coverage across product‑owner stances.** List how each stance is explored and amplified by AI tools (customer understanding, visionary storytelling, experimentation, decision‑making, collaboration, orchestration and ethics). Use the new “Orchestrator” stance and the focus on ethics to differentiate this course from generic AI training.

4. **Reassure on ethics and security.** Address common concerns by explaining that data is encrypted and not used for training in paid versions of tools, but emphasise the importance of organizational governance. Incorporate environmental awareness (the hidden cost of each prompt) and bias awareness.

5. **Incorporate memorable quotes and metaphors.** Use the witty quotes as headlines or call‑outs to engage potential learners and convey the course’s behavioural‑economics‑influenced messaging. For example: _“Solve real problems – nobody argues about fire hoses during a fire”_ to emphasise investing in AI skills, or _“If you don’t pay, you’re the product”_ when talking about ethical tool use.

By weaving these insights into marketing content, Rory Sutherland can craft compelling narratives that appeal to both the rational and emotional motivations of prospective students. The course’s blend of hard skills (prompt engineering, prototyping, prioritization) and soft skills (storytelling, empathy, ethics) makes it stand out in a crowded training market.
