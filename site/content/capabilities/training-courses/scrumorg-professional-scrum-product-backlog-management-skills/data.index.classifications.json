    "reasoning": "The content primarily focuses on Scrum and Product Backlog management, with no direct mention of the Shift-Left Strategy. While it discusses stakeholder engagement and decision-making, these topics do not align with the core principles of integrating testing, security, and compliance early in the software development lifecycle. The discussion lacks depth regarding Shift-Left practices, making it largely irrelevant to the category.",
