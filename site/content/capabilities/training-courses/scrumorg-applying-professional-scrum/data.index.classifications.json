    "reasoning": "The course content is focused exclusively on traditional Scrum fundamentals and Agile teamwork, with no mention—explicit or conceptual—of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or related practices. There is no evidence of integrating AI, agentic frameworks, or modern agent-based delivery patterns. All topics revolve around human team practices, Scrum rituals, and basic Agile concepts, which are explicitly excluded from the Agentic Software Delivery category unless explicitly reframed to include AI agents or context-aware systems. Therefore, confidence in fit is extremely low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content teaches human-centric Scrum without discussion of AI agents or agentic practices. No alignment with Agentic Software Delivery; the fit is extremely low and purely surface-level.",
