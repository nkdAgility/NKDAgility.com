introduction: |-
  Applying Professional Scrum™ (APS) is a hands-on, activity-based course where students experience how Professional Scrum and the Scrum framework enhance their ability to deliver value compared to traditional methods. Scrum offers a superior way of working by emphasizing experimentation, incremental delivery of customer value, frequent feedback loops, and fostering strong team dynamics.

  This course provides an active learning environment for students to engage in discussions, team-based exercises, and individual reflection. Throughout the course, students work in Scrum Teams over a series of Sprints, learning Scrum while applying it.

  Additionally, the course includes a free attempt at the globally recognized Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification exam.
overview: |-
  The Applying Professional Scrum course is the perfect introduction, reboot or refresher to Scrum. It is excellent training for organizations, teams, and individuals wanting to experience the benefits of Scrum, or for those interested in continuing their learning with more advanced training. 
  - Professionals who are part of a team that currently uses Scrum, but desire a refresher so that they get the most out of their use of Scrum.
  - Professionals who are joining a team that currently uses Scrum.
  - Professionals that don't use Scrum directly but want to learn how to work with colleagues that do use Scrum.
  - Professionals that are investigating to see if Scrum makes sense for them and their colleagues.
  - Professionals that are part of an organization that intends to use Scrum in the near future.
  - Teams who are learning to use Scrum together in their organizations

  The course also provides the foundational Scrum knowledge needed for those wishing to continue their education with role-focused (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, Leader) training classes. APS is not recommended for advanced Scrum professionals. This course is designed to be domain-agnostic; it conveys the use of Scrum in any domain or industry with complex problems to solve. Trainers typically have experience in multiple industries and may be able to tailor the course to the needs of your team. Students and teams building software products may want to consider our domain-specific course: Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development.
