      title: You need teams that can navigate uncertainty and deliver value consistently—starting now
      content: |
        You're leading teams through complex product development. Priorities shift. Stakeholders want predictability you can't give. Teams struggle with unclear direction, delivery friction, and disconnected work. You need more than Scrum theory—you need the confidence to make better decisions under pressure, the capability to guide teams through ambiguity, and practical techniques that work in real organisations.

        This course builds that capability. You'll learn Scrum by doing it—working in Scrum Teams across multiple Sprints, experiencing firsthand how empiricism, transparency, and collaboration create better outcomes than traditional planning. You'll discover what works, what doesn't, and why—through hands-on exercises, real team challenges, and reflection on your own work context. You'll leave with techniques you can apply immediately, the ability to identify and avoid common pitfalls, and validation through the globally recognised Professional Scrum Master I certification.

    title: How NKD Agility makes this different
    sideContent: |
      This is a Scrum.org course delivered with NKD Agility's immersive learning approach—designed to build lasting capability, not just knowledge transfer.

      Most Scrum training fails because participants return to work and can't apply what they learned. They have information but not integration. NKD's immersive format solves the real bottleneck: **time to apply, reflect, and refine**. You'll experience Scrum across multiple Sprints during the course itself, work through real team dynamics, and learn by doing—not just by listening.
    list:
      - content: "**Hands-on Scrum experience**: Work in Scrum Teams over a series of Sprints, experiencing what it's like to deliver using Scrum"
      - content: "**Real challenges, not theory**: Interactive exercises including Minecraft simulations that surface real collaboration, planning, and delivery challenges"
      - content: "**Pattern recognition from 20+ years**: Martin Hinshelwood's technical depth and organisational experience means you get context and insight beyond the Scrum Guide"
      - content: "**Practical techniques you can use immediately**: Leave with a set of proven practices that enhance your application of Scrum in your organisation"
      - content: "**Foundation for deeper learning**: Establishes the Scrum knowledge needed for advanced role-focused training (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer)"
