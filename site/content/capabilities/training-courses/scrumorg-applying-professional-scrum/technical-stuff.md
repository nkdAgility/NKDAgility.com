## Minecraft for Education

You will need to install Minecraft Education Edition and test that it works for you.

**Important:** Once you have installed Minecraft, open it, click **Settings**, and then on **Profile** disable "Single Sign On". This will stop it from auto-logging in with your corporate credentials. You need to be logged in with your `@nkdagility.com` account; otherwise, you will not be able to join the virtual classroom!

- **Email address:** `[yourEmailAlias].APS@nkdagility.com` (e.g., `Bob.Surly.APS@nkdagility.com` for `Bob.Surly@company.com`)
- **Password:** `StudentStart2022` <-- you will be asked to change it when you first log in.

> **Note:** Your account is deleted after the class and only has access to Minecraft.

If you experience any problems with the connection, please let me know! Most issues can be resolved by closing Minecraft entirely and opening it again.

### For Non-Gamers and Your Enjoyment

Here are a few tutorial videos to make your class experience more fun. These videos are optional to watch and are not skills that are mandatory to master for your class.

## Video Conferencing Platform

We use **Microsoft Teams** to host all our events, and we recommend joining using the application rather than the web client. Please join from a laptop or desktop device with two monitors if possible. The use of tablets and phones for participating in the class is highly discouraged as it reduces the experience for both participants and trainers.

If you are unfamiliar with any of the key features of Microsoft Teams that we will be using, please make yourself familiar before the class:

- **Breakout Rooms** - We use guided breakout rooms to facilitate liberating structures and training from the back of the room techniques.
  - [How to Join a breakout room in a Teams meeting](https://support.microsoft.com)
- **Dedicated Team Rooms** - Sometimes, we work in dedicated teams periodically throughout the class. We will use a dedicated meeting link for each team (based on colour). Remember your team colour and join the appropriate meeting link.
  - [How to Join a meeting in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com)
- **Video** - Being able to read the room is vital for creating an engaging experience. We recommend keeping your camera on unless otherwise agreed with the trainer.

## Digital Whiteboard Platform

We use **Mural** as a digital whiteboard. Please take 10 minutes before your first training session to familiarise yourself with Mural. We will post an **Obstacle Run** training mural before the class for this purpose; if you don't see it, ask!

## Classroom Platform

We use **Mighty Networks** to create fantastic experiences for our students, allowing you to engage with trainers and peers before, during, and after the class.

- **Join here:** [Lean-Agile Community from naked Agility (nkdagility.com)](https://nkdagility.com)

We're creating something special with **The League of Extraordinary Lean-Agile Practitioners**. Please share generously, support other members, and avoid trolling, self-promotion, or judgement. We're doing something different here!

## Data Privacy

To provide access to systems, process classes, and assess participants, three entities have access to your data:

- [Privacy Policy | Scrum.org](https://scrum.org/privacy-policy)
- [Privacy Policy | Mighty Networks](https://mighty.networks/privacy-policy)
- [Privacy Policy | naked Agility with Martin Hinshelwood](https://nkdagility.com/privacy-policy)

For classes with 3rd party courseware (Scrum.org / Accentient), all students are submitted to that body for processing.

## Support & Documentation

Each scheduled section of the class will last either **two full days** or **four half-days**, depending on your or your organisation's choice. Classes are broken into 4 or 3.5-hour segments (full days include 1 hour for lunch) with at least one 15-minute break.

> **Note:** At the discretion of the course leader, a participant missing more than 15 minutes of any call or a total of one hour may be required to retake the course.

All documentation for this course will be provided in the **Course Materials** section of your training within **The League of Extraordinary Lean-Agile Practitioners** engagement platform.

- **Join here:** [Lean-Agile Community from naked Agility (nkdagility.com)](https://nkdagility.com)
