Identify behaviors and characteristics of a great team together with your Scrum Team and identify areas where your team could improve.
- Observe people's work to get a better understanding about the flow of their work and their ability to focus. Identify any interruptions and discuss with the team how those interruptions could be minimized. 
- Identify any dependencies that are interrupting the team’s flow and identify experiments that could help reduce those dependencies.

- Identify a difficult situation and facilitate a discussion with your team where you tie this situation back to the Scrum Values and the assets of a collaborative team to identify potential improvements.
- Facilitate a discussion with your team(s) about dependencies they have to other people to get their work done. Run at least one experiment to minimize one of these dependencies.
- Facilitate a discussion with your team(s) about dependencies and if restructuring teams might help reducing these dependencies. Run an experiment to have a person from outside of the team to work as a team member for one day and discuss the differences this makes.
- Facilitate a discussion with your team(s) how much the assets of a collaborative team are covered and run at least one experiment to improve one of the assets.
