## Assignment: Empirical vs Waterfall

**Ask**: _Assess how much empiricism your team is using to plan product delivery and apply at least one experiment to make it even more empirical._


### Examples

- Assess if your team and your organization is more using a product or a project mindset for the product you are developing with your team. How is unpredictability currently handled? Have a conversation with some stakeholders how you could benefit from moving more towards a product mindset and which objections people have.
- Assess if there is a proper Product Goal in place and if the Product Backlog is organized in a way that helps achieving the Product Goal.
- Facilitate a Product Backlog refinement to improve understanding, granularity and transparency to help better achieve the Product Goal.
- Reflect with your teams how and why you are doing sizing and estimation currently and if there are better options to help with Sprint Planning and forecasts and measuring progress towards goals in a complex environment.
- Assess if your Product Backlog Items have a good size to be worked on during a Sprint and slice at least one bigger item into smaller ones by splitting it vertically.
- Assess if your Product Backlog Items are structured in a way that they can deliver some business value on their own or if they depend on other items before a business value can be delivered.
- Evaluate if your Product Backlog is creating transparency by interviewing various team members and stakeholders about where to focus next.
- Interview your Product Owner about the current Product Goal and the next steps toward this by examining the current Product Backlog.
- Interview team members about their understanding of the direction and next steps to evaluate if there is enough clarity and transparency provided by the Product Backlog.
- Record situations when the team was approached in ways that impede empiricism and how the team handled the situation. Define at least one improvement. 
- Evaluate if your Product Backlog is more used like a plan or if it is use to help with empirically achieving your goals. Suggest at least one experiment to the team how this can be improved.
