## Assignment: Shift Left

**Assignment**: _Evaluate how consistently your team delivers a Done Increment and examine the level of uncertainty or surprises that these Increments may still include. Reflect on the current Definition of Done and its effectiveness in achieving consistent delivery. Identify areas for improvement, experiment with at least one change, and share your insights._
These tasks aim to foster a deeper understanding of what Done means within your team and help drive continuous improvement by refining the Definition of Done.


### Examples

- If your team does not currently use a Definition of Done, facilitate a discussion to raise awareness of its importance. Work with your Scrum Team to establish an initial Definition of Done that can be continuously inspected and adapted.
- Add criteria to your Definition of Done to reduce uncertainty and avoid last-minute surprises, ensuring higher quality and consistency.
- Remove criteria from your Definition of Done that are not contributing to quality and are creating obstacles to frequent Done Increments.
- Assess how transparent your team is about technical debt and undone work. Implement at least one improvement to address the accumulation of technical debt.
- During a Daily Scrum, facilitate a discussion to help the team reflect on what is still required to reach a Done Increment based on the Definition of Done. Explore ways to organize work to achieve this as quickly as possible.
- Discuss with your team how to achieve a Done Increment earlier in the Sprint. Conduct an experiment to test at least one approach in this direction.
- During Sprint Planning or Backlog Refinement, facilitate discussions to slice Product Backlog Items (PBIs) into smaller, more manageable parts. Focus on vertical slicing to help deliver Done Increments earlier.
- Run an experiment with Mob-Programming or Pair-Programming to see if it helps achieve a Done Increment more quickly and efficiently.
- Try out Swarming to encourage the team to focus on building a Done Increment collaboratively.
- Compile a list of reasons why team members struggle to achieve a Done Increment every Sprint. Choose at least one of these reasons and run an experiment to address it.
- If QA processes are conducted at the end of the Sprint, run an experiment to start QA earlier and assess its impact.
- If QA is handled exclusively by dedicated team members, experiment by involving other team members in the QA process, such as through pairing with QA personnel.
- If QA is done outside the team, try conducting QA within the team and within the Sprint, and observe any changes in the process.
