    "reasoning": "The course content is focused on the Agile Kata pattern, process improvement, and agile transformation. It mentions teams using Kanban as a target audience but does not address the Definition of Workflow or its key Kanban policies (entry/exit, WIP limits, explicit agreements). There are no direct references or in-depth discussion of this specific category. The intent is broadly aligned with improving ways of working, but not with making workflow explicit in the Kanban sense. The audience overlaps only in that Kanban practitioners may be present.",

    "reasoning": "The content describes a course centered on teaching the Agile Kata pattern for process improvement and business agility. While it references 'agile values,' culture, and transformation, its focus remains on practical application and adoption of a specific pattern and associated techniques. There is minimal explicit exploration of underlying organizational ethos; mentions of values and culture are not deeply analyzed as core system-level convictions. The intended outcomes and topics address process improvement and transformation tools more than examining or developing the foundational ethos underpinning these systems. Therefore, the scoring reflects moderate conceptual alignment but weak direct mention, depth, and intent toward Ethos as strictly defined. The content is largely targeted at practitioners and relevant audiences, with limited off-topic information, so audience and signal scores are higher.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course focuses on practical adoption of the Agile Kata for process and cultural improvement, referencing agile values and transformation. However, it does not explicitly explore or deeply analyze underlying ethos, concentrating instead on actionable methods and patterns, so alignment with the Ethos category is limited.",

However, there are no direct references to Agentic Engineering or concepts such as developer or AI agency, systemic observability, ethical AI, or DevOps-infused craft. The themes only weakly touch on decentralization and feedback-driven adaptation, with no explicit philosophical framing or technical discussion aligned with Agentic Engineering. Thus, conceptual and depth scores are modest, while audience and signal are higher due to relevance to technical practitioners.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course teaches Agile Kata for process and business agility improvement but lacks Agentic Engineering's emphasis on human/AI agency, engineering practices, or ethical autonomy.

There are no direct or indirect mentions of agentic software delivery, AI agents, contextual intelligence, or integration of human expertise with autonomous systems. The course audience is agile teams and leaders, which is somewhat parallel to the intended audience for Agentic Software Delivery, but the themes and topics are unrelated. The course appears rooted in traditional agile and process improvement approaches, not in the proactive, intelligence-driven systems or agentic principles defined by the classification. Thus, only minimal scores are warranted across all dimensions, reflecting a near-total lack of fit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is on agile transformation via the Agile Kata pattern, with no discussion of AI agents or agentic software delivery. No mention or conceptual overlap exists; intent, themes, and practices do not match the agentic category.",
