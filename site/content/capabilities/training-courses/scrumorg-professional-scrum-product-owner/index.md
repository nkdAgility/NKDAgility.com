introduction: |
  Welcome to the Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO) course. This transformative learning journey is designed specifically for Product Owners, Leaders, Entrepreneurs, and Managers eager to deeply understand and incorporate Scrum values and principles into their work. The course offers practical case studies and engaging exercises to ensure a hands-on learning experience.

  In the ever-evolving product landscape, a thorough understanding of Scrum is not just beneficial but essential for modern teams. Scrum practices equip organizations with the agility, responsiveness, and efficiency needed to thrive amidst changing market dynamics.
overview: |
  There are many myths and misconceptions about the role of the Product Owner. The accountabilities of the Product Owner, however, go well beyond managing the Product Backlog and writing User Stories. The Product Owner is pivotal to bridging business strategy and product execution in order to help the organization create valuable products.

  In this two day class* students will develop and solidify their knowledge of the Scrum framework and the accountabilities of being a Product Owner through instruction and team-based exercises. Students learn techniques that they can use to help them overcome the challenges that are often encountered on a day-to-day basis. They will do this while learning better ways to collaborate and engage with the users and customers, stakeholders, their team(s) and organization to provide greater value in the product being delivered.

  View the different Focus Areas covered within this class and others.

  *  When offered in-person, this course is generally delivered over two consecutive days. When offered as a Live Virtual Class, the course may be broken up into more, shorter days.
