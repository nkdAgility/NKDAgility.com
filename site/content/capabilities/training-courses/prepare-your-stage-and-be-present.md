title: Prepare your stage and be present
type: resources

I have taught many Professional Scrum classes in the last 22 months, and I am still surprised to see shadows, up nostrils, half-heads, and blank screens instead of people.

If we can't see each other clearly, we can't understand each other as well. I often read the room for breaks, focus, understanding, and disagreement, which shapes the content I deliver. If you want a class that is engaging and not boring, then participation is key, and the first step is **presence!**

If you are in leadership, it is doubly essential that you demonstrate the level of participation you would expect from others.

I would be very surprised if we went to a physical meeting room and:

- Sat on the floor with only the top half of your head visible (the short-arse)
- Put your head on the table so I could only see the top of your head (the baldie)
- Leaned all the way back in the chair and looked at the roof (the nostril)
- Were contained within a cardboard box with only your legs poking out the bottom (the no-camera)

If you think those methods of participation would be disrespectful in a physical meeting, why would you think it's okay in virtual?

We all spend a lot of time on video calls, and I, for one, want to keep working from home. As part of human communication, 70-93% of our cues about others are non-verbal. Think about how you present yourself visually on a call just as you would in a meeting room sitting across from us.

### What Do I Expect:

- **To be able to see you**, preferably from the waist up to maximise body language.
- **Not to be looking up your nose,** at your forehead, or to only see the top half of your head.
- **To be able to hear you clearly**

To achieve this and maintain the WFH life many of us appreciate, I would like you to consider the following:

---

### Camera

Having a high-quality camera is important. Usually, the one on your laptop, especially if it's a cheap one, isn't good enough. I recommend the **Elgato Facecam**. If you're more tech-savvy, you can use an old phone (they usually have excellent cameras) and the NDI application to stream its video to your computer. If you need help, please contact me.

> I use an **Elgato Facecam**: Don't skimp here; it's essential to have a high-quality camera that balances the light well.

### Lighting

This is extremely important! Make sure you don't have a light behind you that renders you in shadow, and get a face light if possible. I live in Scotland, where in winter, it’s only light between 10:00-14:00, so I need front lights for you to be able to see me well. If you get lights, ensure you can control the tone and intensity. Bright lighting all the time can get tiring.

> I use **Elgato Key Light**, but there are many affordable options on Amazon. Even a simple ring light will be better than nothing. I got 2 studio diffused lights and a greenscreen for £40 on Amazon basics.

### Microphone

Use a decent microphone that isn't attached to your laptop. Laptop microphones pick up every sound, like typing, and are generally low quality. Investing in a good microphone can make all the difference. I recommend the **Elgato Wave**!

> I use a **Yeti Blue Microphone**, but I recommend the **Elgato Wave**: Don't skimp here; this is essential.

### Background

This one may be limited due to our home situation. If you're using a blur or virtual background, I recommend having a wall behind you.

> I don’t use a virtual background: You can ask about what's on my wall behind me; it's a good icebreaker. I also have an Elgato wall-mounted greenscreen, but it's a luxury and unnecessary for most, though lots of fun.

### Clothes

Wear what you want! Got you! You might have expected me to say to wear a suit or shirt! No, wear what makes you comfortable. There’s no stigma here—jammies, dressing gowns, or anything else. I've seen it all, and as long as you're comfortable and not making others unreasonably uncomfortable, wear what you want.

> I’m a slacks and polo kind of guy. The last time I wore a tie was in 2010, except for a brief stint consulting for a company with a dress code in London. Lesson learned—if a company has a dress code... I'm out.

### Conclusion

If we can't see you, we can’t understand each other as well. I use those I can see and hear to read the room and to shape and control the content of my training, workshops, and meetings.
