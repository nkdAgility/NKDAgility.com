You're under pressure to use AI, but you're drowning in hype, vendor pitches, and failed pilot projects. Your teams need to use AI safely and effectively in their actual work, but they don't need to become data scientists. You need a shared language for AI that cuts through the noise, shows how it really works, and gives your people the confidence to use it reliably without creating new risks.

The **AI Literacy Workshop** delivers exactly that. In one focused session, your team learns how modern AI actually works, why most initiatives fail, and how to use AI safely and effectively using proven Kendall prompt and context tools. This is not theory or vendor marketing—it's practical literacy that your teams can apply immediately to real work challenges.

You'll leave with clarity, capability, and a reusable framework that works.

## What You'll Be Able to Do Differently

After this workshop, participants can:

**Explain how AI really works—in plain language**

No more black box confusion. You'll understand prediction, tokens, embeddings, attention mechanisms, and why AI sometimes gets things spectacularly wrong. This foundation lets you use AI with realistic expectations and make better decisions about where it fits.

**Use a standard, low-variation prompt format**

Stop reinventing every AI request. You'll master the Kendall prompt template: *You are... / As... / I need... / So that... / Task is... / Output as...* This single structure works across tools, teams, and problems—reducing guesswork and improving results immediately.

**Recognise why context is the real constraint**

Most AI failures aren't tool failures—they're context failures. You'll understand what "context" actually means in your organisation, how to identify high-value context you can safely share, and why better context dramatically reduces errors and hallucinations.

**Apply Kendall tools to your own work the next day**

Walk out with a prompt template, context identification techniques, and practical patterns you can use immediately. No waiting for platform rollouts or approval processes—just capability you can apply to real problems right away.

**Assess AI quality and risk realistically**

You'll recognise hallucinations as quality defects, not mysteries. You'll understand data protection considerations, governance needs, and how to evaluate whether an AI output is trustworthy. This lens helps you use AI safely without creating new organisational risks.

This is not "AI awareness" training. This is practical literacy that changes how your teams work with AI from day one.

## Why Most AI Initiatives Fail—And How This Workshop Prevents That

**Most AI training focuses on features, not foundations**

Generic AI courses teach you to click around vendor interfaces or brainstorm theoretical use cases. This workshop teaches you to think clearly about how AI works and where it fits in real work—so you're not locked into one tool or chasing trends.

**Most organisations lack a shared language for AI**

Teams talk past each other because they don't have common mental models. Some think AI is magic; others think it's a search engine. This workshop creates a unified language across business, operations, and technical roles—eliminating confusion and enabling better decisions.

**Most prompts are inconsistent, verbose, and unreliable**

When everyone writes prompts differently, results vary wildly. The Kendall prompt template is a low-variation structure grounded in quality and Lean thinking—not tips and tricks. It reduces cognitive load, improves consistency, and works across contexts.

**Most teams don't understand context—so AI fails predictably**

Context is the raw material AI needs to produce useful outputs. Without systematic context identification, AI initiatives produce unreliable results, create compliance risks, and stall in pilot purgatory. This workshop shows you how to identify, structure, and use context strategically.

**Most AI training avoids the uncomfortable truths**

AI gets things wrong. It hallucinates. It can expose sensitive data. It requires governance. This workshop addresses those realities directly, with psychological safety and pragmatic guidance—so your teams can use AI confidently without creating new problems.

This workshop is operations-first, problem-first, and grounded in real organisational constraints. You learn how to use AI to solve the problems you already have, not chase imaginary opportunities.

## What the Workshop Covers

**1. Demystify AI—how LLMs actually work**

Simple explanations of prediction, tokens, embeddings, transformers, and attention mechanisms. You'll understand "predict the next word" and why AI sometimes produces plausible nonsense. Real examples (Mary had a little... / autocomplete metaphors / nearest neighbour matching) make this accessible to non-technical participants.

**2. Why AI gets things wrong—and how to reduce errors**

Hallucinations explained as missing context and quality defects. You'll see how better context dramatically reduces errors and why "garbage in, garbage out" applies to AI even more than traditional systems.

**3. AI Leadership Principles (from Kendall Framework)**

- **Context is king** — AI quality depends on the context you provide
- **Language is the raw material** — Clear language creates better AI outputs
- **"Who" anchors AI** — Defining roles and perspectives shapes AI behaviour

Each principle is illustrated with simple visuals and business examples that connect to real work.

**4. The Kendall Prompt—the only prompt you'll ever need**

Learn the structured prompt format: *You are... / As... / I need... / So that... / Task is... / Output as...* Live examples show how this template works across different problems. Participants write prompts for their own work and see immediate improvement.

**5. Context in practice—making AI reliable**

What counts as context in your organisation? Uploading documents, explaining systems, defining workflows, and identifying unique organisational knowledge as a strategic asset. You'll learn how to structure context for AI without exposing sensitive data.

**6. Hands-on application—solve real problems in the room**

Participants work on 1–2 of their own challenges using the prompt template and context techniques. You'll experience better AI outputs immediately and leave with confidence to apply these tools in daily work.

This is not abstract theory. Every element connects to real work challenges your teams face now.

## Who This Workshop Is For

**Leaders under pressure to "do something with AI"**

You're expected to have an AI strategy, but you're not sure where to start or what's real versus hype. This workshop gives you a pragmatic foundation and shared language so you can make better decisions about AI investment and use.

**Teams who need to use AI in their work—safely**

Your people are already experimenting with ChatGPT, Copilot, or other tools, but without structure or guidance. This workshop gives them reliable patterns and risk awareness so they can use AI effectively without creating compliance or quality problems.

**Non-technical professionals who feel AI pressure**

You don't need to become a data scientist, but you do need to understand how AI works and where it fits. This workshop demystifies AI and shows you how to use it confidently in your role.

**Organisations preparing for broader AI initiatives**

Before investing in platforms, agents, or automation, you need teams who understand AI fundamentals and can articulate real problems. This workshop creates that foundation so subsequent AI initiatives have a realistic chance of success.

Bring together business, operations, and technical roles. AI doesn't respect organisational boundaries, so your workshop participants shouldn't either. The best outcomes come from diverse perspectives aligned around shared understanding.

## Workshop Format and What You'll Walk Away With

**Duration:** Half-day (3–4 hours) or full-day (depending on depth and hands-on practice)

**Delivery format:** Traditional format (condensed session with focused teaching and exercises)

**What you'll receive:**

- **The Kendall prompt template** — ready to use immediately in your work
- **Context identification techniques** — practical patterns for structuring context
- **Realistic AI mental models** — understand how AI works and where it fails
- **Shared language across your team** — eliminate confusion and improve collaboration
- **Confidence to use AI safely** — recognise risks and apply governance thinking

You leave with capability, not just knowledge. These are tools you can apply the next day to real work.

## How AI Literacy Fits Into the Kendall Framework

The AI Literacy Workshop is the **entry point** into the Kendall Framework for AI Operations. It creates the foundation every successful AI initiative needs.

**The Kendall Framework connects:**

- **AI Literacy** (this workshop) — Understand how AI works and use it safely
- **Context 360** — Discover and document operational reality for AI
- **AI Operations Design** — Design agents and automation with complete context
- **Governance & Safety** — Define policies and guardrails for reliable AI behaviour

Without AI Literacy, teams lack the mental models to use AI effectively. With it, they can participate meaningfully in AI initiatives, identify real problems, and use AI tools with confidence.

This workshop is where clarity begins.

Martin Hinshelwood has spent decades helping organisations adopt new technologies and ways of working. AI is the latest transformation challenge—and the patterns that make adoption work are consistent. You're learning from someone who's guided hundreds of teams through complex change.

**Operations-first, not vendor-first**

This workshop teaches you to think about AI, not just use a specific tool. You learn principles and patterns that work across platforms—so you're not locked into one vendor's ecosystem or dependent on their marketing.

**Pragmatic, not aspirational**

No hype, no guarantees, no wishful thinking. This workshop addresses AI's real limitations and risks alongside its capabilities. You'll leave with realistic expectations and practical tools—not inflated promises that collapse on contact with reality.

**Psychological safety and clarity**

AI creates anxiety because it's new, complex, and overhyped. This workshop creates space for honest questions, reduces jargon, and respects participants' current knowledge. You'll feel confident, not overwhelmed.

This is not theoretical AI literacy. It's practical capability building designed for real organisations with real constraints.

## The Outcome

Your teams will speak a common language about AI, use it safely and effectively in their work, and recognise where it fits and where it doesn't. You'll stop chasing hype and start using AI to solve real problems.

After this workshop, you'll have:

**Clarity on how AI actually works**

No more black box confusion or vendor mysticism. You'll understand the mechanics well enough to make informed decisions about where AI fits and where it doesn't.

**A reusable prompt template that works**

One structure that reduces guesswork, improves consistency, and produces better results across tools and problems.

**Confidence to use AI safely**

Recognition of risks, quality concerns, and governance needs—so you can use AI without creating new organisational problems.

**A shared team foundation for AI**

Everyone speaking the same language, aligned on realistic expectations, and ready to participate meaningfully in AI initiatives.
