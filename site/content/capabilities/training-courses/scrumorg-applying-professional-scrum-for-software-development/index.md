  ### What Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development Students Say

  <iframe title="Customer reviews powered by Trustpilot" src="https://widget.trustpilot.com/trustboxes/53aa8912dec7e10d38f59f36/index.html?businessunitId=5c12d8d7393a0100015d1c3e&amp;templateId=53aa8912dec7e10d38f59f36#locale=en-US&amp;stars=4%2C5&amp;styleHeight=140px&amp;styleWidth=250%25&amp;tags=classtype%3Aaps-sd&amp;theme=light" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe>
    
overview: The Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development (APS-SD) course is designed for various roles within a Scrum Team, including architects, analysts, programmers, database developers, testers, managers, IT-Operations, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners. It is recommended that the entire Scrum Team, consisting of Developers, Scrum Master, and Product Owner, attend the course together to experience the benefits of teamwork fully. Attending as a team allows for immediate application of learned concepts and the ability to draw upon classroom experiences during challenging situations.  However, individuals attending without their entire team can still derive significant value from the course. They will have the opportunity to work within a Scrum Team during the training and can transfer their learnings to their teammates. This often leads to convincing their colleagues of the advantages of utilizing Scrum, Agile, and DevOps practices.
