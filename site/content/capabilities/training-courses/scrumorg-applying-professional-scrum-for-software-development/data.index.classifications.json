It touches on project management concepts like backlog management, team collaboration, and delivery, but its central purpose is preparing developers for the PSD I certification—making its project management relevance partial. Most discussion is from a development and technical perspective, with some brief nods to planning and execution, but lacks substantial depth or focus on wider project management principles, lifecycles, governance, or stakeholder management. Audience is mostly practitioners within development teams, not managers or project leaders. There is limited direct mention of project management as a discipline.",
