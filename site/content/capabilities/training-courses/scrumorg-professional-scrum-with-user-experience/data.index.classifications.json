It highlights modern UX, cross-functional team collaboration, experimentation, and value delivery, with some indirect resonance with the idea of underlying convictions (e.g., outcomes over outputs, framing work as problems, continuous learning). However, it never mentions or deeply explores ethos, system-level beliefs, or foundational stances. Discussions focus on 'how' and 'what' rather than 'why' or the deep-rooted values that sustain practices. Its audience is relevant, and the content is focused, but discussion remains practical and surface-level, not delving into the ethos underlying Agile/UX integration.",
