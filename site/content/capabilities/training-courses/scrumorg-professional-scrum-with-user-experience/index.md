overview: |2+

  - Scrum Masters and Product Owners will learn how to integrate the UX speciality with what they already know about the power of self-organizing cross-functional teams. This will enable them to help Developers to learn about the customer, plan learning/discovery/design work, and still deliver a "Done" increment each Sprint. In addition, Scrum Masters will learn how to incorporate product discovery techniques into Sprints and how to balance the product discovery work with the product delivery work while Product Owners will learn product discovery techniques that User Experience Designers use to better understand the needs of the user.
  - UX Professionals struggling to integrate on a Scrum Team will learn how to work more effectively inside Scrum, managing work in Sprints and visualizing it in the Product Backlog.
  - People who have learned about Lean UX and want to learn how to integrate those concepts into Professional Scrum working together in a unified Scrum Team.
