      <p>This course is intended for executives, managers, and other leaders who
      want to learn more about Scrum, why it works, and a high-level approach to
      get started on their path to agility. Typical attendees are those who have
      never heard of Scrum but want their organization to become agile or those
      who may be evaluating Scrum, to see if it’s right for their organization.
      Other attendees may be from organizations that are already on their way to
      adopting Scrum. Regardless of your current capabilities, this course is
      flexible enough to give you the knowledge that you require.</p>
