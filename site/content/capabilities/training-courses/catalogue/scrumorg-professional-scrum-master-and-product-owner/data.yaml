Merging PSM and PSPO together enables side-by-side learning in a way that is not possible when Scrum Masters and Product Owners are trained separately. These learners greatly benefit from having a shared understanding for one another and\_by blending the content, students avoid duplicate foundational content and have more space to focus on learning together.
