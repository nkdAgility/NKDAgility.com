    <p>This instructor-led class is intended to answer three questions commonly
    asked by Stakeholders:&nbsp;<em>What is Scrum? Why will Scrum be better for
    me? How will I work differently going forward.</em>&nbsp;Through
    presentation and discussion, attendees will learn the answers to these
    questions. By forming into teams and collaborating on activities and
    discussions, attendees will experience and see the truth behind those
    answers.</p>
