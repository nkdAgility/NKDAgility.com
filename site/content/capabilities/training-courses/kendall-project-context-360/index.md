Organisations fail with AI because they jump into solutions without understanding the environment those solutions must operate in. You're trying to deploy AI agents or automation, but they produce inconsistent, inaccurate, or unsafe results because they lack operational context. Teams disagree on how work actually flows, policies are poorly documented, and AI initiatives stall without a clear foundation. You need a structured way to capture how your organisation really works so AI can deliver reliable outcomes.

The **Context 360 Workshop** fixes that. It's the discovery engine of the Kendall Framework, translating your operations, rules, workflows, and decision patterns into an AI-ready format. Through structured facilitation and cross-functional collaboration, you'll surface high-value problems, align teams around how work really happens, and build the complete operational blueprint that gives AI the context it needs to succeed.

Context 360 transforms AI from a risky experiment into a structured, manageable initiative with clear outcomes. You stop guessing where AI fits and start designing AI that works.

## What the Workshop Delivers

Through a focused half-day to full-day session, you'll walk away with tangible outputs you can use immediately:

**1. A prioritised list of meaningful problems for AI**

Your team surfaces the highest-value opportunities grounded in real operational needs — not theoretical use cases or wishful thinking, but problems that matter to your business right now. You'll understand which challenges deliver the most value when solved with AI and which ones to tackle first.

**2. A shared understanding of how work actually flows**

Cross-functional roles align around the real system of work, eliminating assumptions and revealing how decisions are made, where value is created, and where constraints exist. Everyone leaves with a common view of reality, not competing interpretations.

**3. A complete Context Bill of Materials**

Policies, workflows, business rules, roles, constraints, exceptions, and decision points — all captured in a structured, AI-ready format. This is not a theoretical model; it's the operational documentation AI needs to understand your environment and act safely.

**4. A clear path into AI Operations**

You leave with everything needed to design, govern, and deploy reliable AI solutions. No guesswork, no false starts — just a stable foundation for AI initiatives that produce consistent, accurate results.

## Why Organisations Need Context 360

AI fails when context is missing or unclear. Most organisations jump into agent deployment or automation without understanding the operational environment those solutions must navigate. Context 360 solves this by giving you:

**Clarity on real operational needs**

Stop guessing where AI can add value. Surface the actual problems that create friction, unpredictability, or risk in your operations — problems where AI can deliver measurable improvement.

**Alignment across teams**

Eliminate disagreements about how work flows by creating a shared, objective view. When business, operations, compliance, engineering, and product teams align around reality, AI initiatives move faster and with less friction.

**Risk reduction**

Capture policies, rules, and exceptions so AI can operate safely and consistently. You'll document the guardrails AI needs to avoid costly mistakes or regulatory violations.

**Faster time to value**

Move from pilot to production with confidence because your AI has the operational foundation it needs. No more failed experiments or stalled initiatives — just structured progress toward working AI.

Context 360 is not theoretical. It's a practical workshop that produces tangible outputs you can use immediately to guide AI design, governance, and deployment.

## What You Can Use It For

**Preparing for AI-enabled transformation**

Build the operational foundation before deploying agents or automation. Understand the environment AI will operate in so you can design solutions that work from day one.

**Validating and prioritising AI use cases**

Surface real problems and assess which ones deliver the most value. Focus your AI investment on opportunities that matter, not trendy experiments.

**Reducing risk in agent and automation deployment**

Ensure AI understands policies, constraints, and exceptions before it acts. Document the rules and guardrails that keep AI safe, compliant, and predictable.

**Accelerating pilot-to-production success**

Move faster by giving AI the context it needs from the start. Eliminate the trial-and-error that slows AI initiatives and increases costs.

**Aligning leadership and teams**

Create shared understanding of what matters and where AI can help. Build buy-in by grounding AI initiatives in real operational challenges, not abstract possibilities.

## Who Should Participate

Leaders and experts who understand how work flows, what decisions matter, what policies apply, and where value is created or lost.

Bring together:

- **Business leaders** who understand strategic priorities and operational realities
- **Operations managers** who know how work flows and where bottlenecks occur
- **Compliance and risk experts** who understand policies, rules, and regulatory constraints
- **Engineering and technical leaders** who design and maintain systems
- **Product managers** who understand customer needs and value delivery

Cross-functional participation is essential. AI operates across boundaries, so your workshop team needs to represent the full operational picture. The best outcomes come from diverse perspectives aligned around a shared problem.

## Workshop Format and Duration

The Context 360 Workshop is run **per problem** that you want to investigate. Each workshop focuses on a specific operational challenge or opportunity where AI could deliver value.

**Typical duration:** Half-day to full-day session, depending on problem complexity and organisational context.

**Facilitation approach:**

- Structured activities to surface operational realities
- Cross-functional collaboration to eliminate assumptions
- Systematic capture of workflows, rules, and decision points
- Real-time validation with domain experts
- AI-ready documentation of operational context

**Workshop outputs:**

- Prioritised problem statement with clear business case
- Documented workflows and decision logic
- Captured policies, rules, constraints, and exceptions
- Role definitions and responsibilities
- Clear next steps for AI design and deployment

You'll leave with a complete operational blueprint that removes ambiguity and gives your organisation a stable foundation for AI.

## How Context 360 Fits Into the Kendall Framework

Context 360 is the **first step** in the Kendall Framework for AI Operations. It creates the operational blueprint that every successful AI initiative needs.

**The Kendall Framework connects:**

- **Context 360** (this workshop) — Discover and document operational reality
- **AI Operations Design** — Design agents and automation with complete context
- **Governance & Safety** — Define policies and guardrails for reliable AI behaviour
- **Deployment & Iteration** — Deploy AI solutions with confidence and improve over time

Without Context 360, AI initiatives are built on assumptions. With it, they're built on reality. You move from guessing to designing, from experiments to structured initiatives with clear outcomes.

## The Outcome

A complete operational blueprint that removes ambiguity and gives your organisation a stable foundation for AI. With Context 360, you stop guessing and start designing AI that works.

You'll leave the workshop with:

**Clarity on where AI can deliver value**

No more theoretical use cases or wishful thinking. You'll understand the real problems AI can solve and the measurable value it can create.

**Shared understanding across teams**

Everyone aligned on how work really happens. No more competing interpretations or assumptions — just a common view of operational reality.

**AI-ready operational context**

Policies, rules, workflows, and decision points captured systematically in a format AI can use. This is the foundation for reliable AI design and deployment.

**Confidence to move forward**

A validated foundation for AI design, governance, and deployment. You'll know what to build, how to govern it, and why it will work.

Context 360 transforms AI from a risky experiment into a structured, manageable initiative with clear outcomes. You stop experimenting and start delivering.
