    "reasoning": "The content is an advanced Scrum Product Owner course with no direct reference to Agentic Engineering as a concept. While related concepts appear, such as stakeholder collaboration, experimentation, value delivery, and decentralised decision-making (aspects that are tangentially related to agentic principles), the focus is strictly on product ownership roles within Scrum. The philosophical depth around the maximisation of both human and AI agency, ethical AI integration, and engineering practices designed for agency is missing. Audience alignment is moderately high, since some pragmatic technical/product leads could overlap with agentic engineering practitioners, but overall, the material is more geared to agile product managers than to agentic engineers or system designers.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course targets advanced Scrum Product Owners, focusing on topics like value delivery, experimentation, and agile governance. While some themes loosely align with agentic principles, the content lacks direct, substantive engagement with Agentic Engineering concepts such as engineering for human and AI agency or ethical AI integration.",
