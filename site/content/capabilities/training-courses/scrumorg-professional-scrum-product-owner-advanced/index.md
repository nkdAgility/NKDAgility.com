  title: Advanced Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO-A) Course with Certification
  content: "Mastering the Product Owner Stances: Professional Scrum Product Owner™ - Advanced (PSPO-A) is a hands-on, activity-based course that focuses on helping experienced Product Owners and Product Managers expand their ability to establish a vision, validate their hypotheses, and ultimately deliver more value to their stakeholders."
code: PSPO-A
level: advanced
introduction: |
  In this 14h, delivered over four half-days, students will gain a better understanding of what it means to deliver value and how to express that value inside and outside of their organization. Through a case study-based series of exercises, combined with instruction, students gain the entrepreneurial product leadership skills and practices critical to growing as a successful Product Owner. The Product Owner role is multifaceted, requiring them to engage in behaviours and adopt mindsets beyond the core of Agility and the Scrum framework. Students explore these techniques and how to pivot among them by exploring several Product Owner "stances" including: 
  - The Customer Representative:
      - Focus on understanding customer problems, pains and opportunities
      - Get into the mindset of the customer, placing yourself in their world, understanding their needs
      - Deliver value by connecting product features to customer outcomes
  - The Visionary:
      - Champion the future state, possibilities, goals and chances
      - Communicate the product vision, strategy and Product Goal
      - Understand value and pricing models
  - The Experimenter:
      - Focus on innovation through experiments, hypotheses, tests, learnings, data and validation of value
      - Understand the Product Owner’s role in a scaled environment
  - The Decision Maker:
      - Focus on making better decisions
      - Navigate conflicting customer feedback
  - The Collaborator:
      - Seek collaboration with stakeholders and the Scrum Team
      - Work beyond the Scrum Team including contracts, finance, budgeting and governance in an agile way
  - The Influencer:
      - Lead the stakeholders, customers and Scrum Team, to move in the right direction and to change their minds, when necessary
      - Learn how to create a stakeholder management strategy

Professional Scrum Product Owner™ - Advanced (PSPO-A) training experience uses a unique blend of self-paced learning, live classroom hands-on activity-based exercises, and community-based aftercare helping experienced Product Owners and Product Managers expand their ability to establish a vision, validate their hypotheses, and ultimately deliver more value to their stakeholders. The course goes beyond the topics explored in the [Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO)](https://nkdagility.com/training/scheduled/professional-scrum-product-owner-pspo-experience-on-8th-august-2022-live-virtual-class-over-4-half-days/) class deepening the attendee's understanding of the role by exploring the many stances of a professional Product Owner. Students should have at least one year of Product Owner experience and practical knowledge of Scrum in order to participate in and benefit from these exercises. Having previously taken the PSPO class is recommended but not required.

- Session 1: The Stances of the Product Owner & The Customer Representative
- Session 2: The Visionary & The Experimenter
- Session 3: The Decision Maker & The Collaborator
