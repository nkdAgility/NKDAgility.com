    Over the five half-day students are introduced to an existing and complex pre-existing product that they are expected to update and improve over a series of Sprints. Students are expected to apply increasingly sophisticated modern engineering practices using the Scrum Framework to manage the complexity. The core focus is on delivering increments of releasable functionality using those modern engineering practices while fending off common challenges of the workplace in a safe space to experiment and improve.

  audience: |-
    The Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development (APS-SD) course is designed for various roles within a Scrum Team, including architects, analysts, programmers, database developers, testers, managers, IT-Operations, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners. It is recommended that the entire Scrum Team, consisting of Developers, Scrum Master, and Product Owner, attend the course together to experience the benefits of teamwork fully. Attending as a team allows for immediate application of learned concepts and the ability to draw upon classroom experiences during challenging situations.

    However, individuals attending without their entire team can still derive significant value from the course. They will have the opportunity to work within a Scrum Team during the training and can transfer their learnings to their teammates. This often leads to convincing their colleagues of the advantages of utilizing Scrum, Agile, and DevOps practices.
