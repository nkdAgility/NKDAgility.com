    "reasoning": "The content focuses on applying flow metrics, analytical tools, and data-driven improvements in Scrum. While it aligns somewhat with agentic themes like empirical adaptation and decision-making through metrics, it does not directly reference deliberate design to maximize human or AI agency, ethical AI integration, or decentralized decision-making frameworks. The audience overlaps with Agentic Engineering, but the discussion centers on efficiency and workflow optimization. There are minimal explicit ties to the category, limited conceptual depth on agency or autonomy, and no mention of technical or ethical frameworks for augmenting human or system agency.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This course centers on using flow metrics within Scrum to improve team efficiency and data-driven decisions, partially aligning with agentic practices. However, it lacks direct discussion of agency, autonomy, or the engineering philosophies core to Agentic Engineering.",

    "reasoning": "There are no direct mentions of Agentic Software Delivery or its defining elements (autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, etc.) in the content. The course focuses on pragmatic use of flow metrics and analytical tools within Scrum to improve workflow and efficiency. While it supports data-informed delivery, there is no sign of AI, agency, or autonomous systems—only traditional empirical process control and data-driven improvement. The audience (Scrum practitioners) partially overlaps, but the content’s themes and intent do not align with agentic delivery principles or practices.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is about flow metrics and data analysis in Scrum, not agentic delivery. There’s no AI, agent, or contextual intelligence—so it does not fit the Agentic Software Delivery category, except by very weak and indirect association.",
