# Retraining and Flexible Payment Options

We understand that training can be expensive, especially during challenging times. However, it might just be the spark needed for a new direction, career advancement, or full-time employment.

### We Want to Help You!

## Our Retraining Approach

If you are currently unemployed or between contracting engagements, we’d still like to support your training goals. Here’s how:

1. **Register for a Class**: Select “Invoice (Direct bank transfer)” instead of paying immediately.
2. **Contact Us**: Email us at “contact [at] nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com” so we can arrange more flexible payment terms.

We only ask for a deposit to cover our costs (usually around $200, depending on the region and course). From there, we can set up:

- **Monthly Payments**
- **Pay When You Get a Gig**

## Why Do We Do This?

We’re committed to elevating the profession of software delivery and believe financial limitations shouldn’t prevent anyone from accessing quality training. This program, along with our Advocates Program, allows you to earn while you train, making it easier to pursue your goals.

## What Do You Get?

- **Outcome**: Access to world-class training
- **Outcome**: Low upfront cost
- **Outcome**: Flexible payment terms
- **Outcome**: Deposit-only option
