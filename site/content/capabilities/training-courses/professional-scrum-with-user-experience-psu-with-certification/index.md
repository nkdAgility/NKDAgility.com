    Over the 4 half-days, students will learn UX techniques<strong> </strong>that work most effectively with Scrum Teams. In addition, you will learn practical tools and practices to best work with customers and their feedback to deliver higher value in the customer's eyes with Scrum Teams without changing Scrum. Students will leave the class understanding how to reconcile UX work with Scrum essentials like the Definition of "Done", Backlog ordering and delivering "Done" Increments every Sprint.  You will learn how to handle design work that may extend beyond a single Sprint, continuing to deliver value each and every Sprint using Scrum. Professional Scrum with User Experience is excellent training for everyone who works on a product team (engineers, product managers, etc): technology teams work better when they’re collaborating across disciplines and specialities. But different priorities, types of work, and the specific working rhythms of each discipline can create silos on teams and inside organizations. Learn how to use the Scrum framework and UX techniques to align your team, focus on value, and foster collaboration. <a tabindex="-1" title="Professional Scrum Training Competency Mapping" href="https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-training-competency-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f5b1722-db3b-4c99-9906-089b6abe48f1">View</a> the different Focus Areas covered within this class and others.

     	<li>UX Professionals struggling to integrate on a Scrum Team will learn how to work more effectively inside Scrum, managing work in Sprints and visualizing it in the Product Backlog.</li>
     	<li>People who have learned about Lean UX and want to learn how to integrate those concepts into Professional Scrum working together in a unified Scrum Team.</li>

### Should UX be part of the Scrum Team?

UX/CX plays a critical role in successful product development. Participants explore Professional Scrum and Lean UX through a unique blend of self-paced learning, live classroom hands-on activity-based exercises, and community-based aftercare.

Throughout the class and between sessions, students leverage Lean UX techniques focusing on the core design and research activities that illustrate how they come together with development and delivery. Attendees explore how these activities fit into a dual-track agile process (Design and Development) where cross-functional teams can work together to explore, experiment and deliver value-based outcomes.

After the class, they get to connect with peers and thought leaders to empirically and incrementally develop their skills in collaborative Lean UX.

The course also includes a complimentary attempt at the globally recognized Professional Scrum with UX I (PSU I) certification exam.
