However, it does not explicitly mention 'Current Value' or its specific indicators like customer satisfaction or revenue impact. The focus is more on metrics for predictability rather than a real-time assessment of value delivered, which is central to the Current Value category. While there is some conceptual alignment with the idea of using metrics to enhance decision-making, the depth of discussion on Current Value itself is limited.",
