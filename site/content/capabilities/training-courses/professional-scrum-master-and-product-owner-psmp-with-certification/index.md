  audience: The Professional Scrum Master and Product Owner course is designed for Scrum Masters and Product Owners to learn together. This is especially important as they collectively provide leadership that Scrum Teams need to satisfy stakeholders,  including customers and users through the early and continuous delivery of value. When bringing this course into your organization, take care to include participants that will be working on teams together. We suggest participants read through the [PSM Focus Areas](https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-training-competency-mapping "Professional Scrum Training Competency Mapping") as well as the [PSPO Focus Areas](https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-training-competency-mapping "Professional Scrum Training Competency Mapping") before the class.

    Our training is delivered as an interactive, activity-based course over half-day sessions using Microsoft Teams, and Mural. Throughout the class, students learn several Scrum Master & Product Ownership practices that they can use once they leave the classroom while also receiving an introduction to Agile Product Management. Between sessions, we provide additional reading, writing, and watching activities to maximise the learning opportunities and complement the classroom experience. 
    - Session 1: Theory & First Principles & The Scrum Framework I
    - Session 2: The Scrum Framework II & Agile Product Management
    - Session 3: Value-driven Development & Done I
    - Session 4: Done II & Product Backlog Management
    - Session 5: Releases and Forecasting & People & Teams I
    - Session 6: People & Teams II & The Scrum Master

     After the conclusion of the class, we provide access to a community of peers and continued access to the trainer through office hours, quarterly catchups, and constant engagement. All students are given a password to take the PSPO1 & PSM I assessments to maximise validated learning. If they take it within 14 days and are unsuccessful, they will be granted a second attempt.  As part of our validated learning experience, we provide a 30-minute learning review, a one-hour coaching session, and access to future courses at a 30% discount on future classes.

Scrum Teams flourish when the Scrum Master and Product Owner accountabilities are well fulfilled. The 3-day Professional Scrum Master and Product Owner (PSMPO) course combines the key learning objectives from both the Scrum.org Professional Scrum Master™ (PSM) and Professional Scrum Product Owner™ (PSPO) courses. Merging PSM and PSPO together enables side-by-side learning in a way that is not possible when Scrum Masters and Product Owners are trained separately. These learners greatly benefit from having a shared understanding for one another and by blending the content, students avoid duplicate foundational content and have more space to focus on learning together. This course includes free attempts at both the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) and Professional Scrum Product Owner I (PSPO I) globally recognized certification exams.
