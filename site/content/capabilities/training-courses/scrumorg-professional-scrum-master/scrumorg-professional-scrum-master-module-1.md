## Assignment: Complexity and Empiricism

**ASK**: _Facilitate a discussion within your organization about how your organization could benefit from Agile and Scrum and what would be potential hindrance tapping the full potential in the current environment. Share results from this discussion with the class and explain how you ensured that everyone had a good understanding of complexity and empiricism._


### Examples

- Explain complexity and empiricism by using the Stacey chart, Cynefin Framework or something else.
- Use the exercise to identify parameters influencing a product development and how predictable they are.
- Create a one-pager describing the goals that the organization wants to achieve by using Scrum and Agile.
- Compare the evolution of various factors between the current situation and Professional Scrum and give some examples from your organization.
- Describe how the group would envision their environment when empiricism is evident.
- Collect a list of reservations people have in your organization about Agile and Scrum and how you suggest that these could be resolved.
- Find a simulation for complexity on the internet and run the simulation with team members and stakeholders.
- Analyze forecasts and plans from past projects or past period of your current project and interview people about their opinion about reasons for deviations from those plans.
- Analyze your current plan and identify if it is mostly focused on goals, features or work and how much flexibility it allows to change directions to still being able to deliver value.
- Facilitate a discussion with your stakeholders about what are the highest risks in your current project, how you can implement early signals and how you might react to these risks.
