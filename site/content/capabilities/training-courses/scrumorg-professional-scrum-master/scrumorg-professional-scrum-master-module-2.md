## Assignment: Are We Doing Scrum?

**Ask:** _Evaluate how effectively your current practices align with the goals defined in the previous assignment. Identify differences between your current process and the Scrum framework as described in the Scrum Guide. Develop a '15% solution'—a small, initial change that could improve your current situation—and gather feedback from others in your organization on this proposal._


### Examples

- Identify potential improvements to a specific Scrum event that will take place during the assignment period. Run an experiment to test how these changes affect the event's outcome.
- Create a list of deviations between your current practices and the Scrum framework as defined in the Scrum Guide. Analyze how these deviations might impact your ability to achieve your goals.
- Suggest improvements for a specific Scrum artifact, then run an experiment to assess the impact of these changes. Collect feedback from team members on their experiences with the adjustments.
- Evaluate how well your current process supports empiricism and identify areas for improvement. Experiment with incorporating specific elements of the Scrum framework to address these opportunities.
- Interview your Product Owner about their understanding of their role and compare it to the responsibilities outlined in the Scrum Guide. Discuss any differences and areas for improvement.
- Facilitate a discussion with your Scrum Team(s) on how they perceive the Scrum Master’s role and how it could better support the team. Use this feedback to identify potential improvements.
- Engage stakeholders in a discussion about the effectiveness of Sprint Reviews in creating transparency and fostering an environment of inspection and adaptation.
- Facilitate a conversation with your Scrum Team(s) about the Scrum Values and how they can enhance collaboration within the team and with external parties. Identify specific actions to reinforce these values.
- Assess the effectiveness of your Sprint Retrospectives in supporting transparency, inspection, and adaptation related to self-management and value delivery. Run an experiment to enhance the Retrospectives' effectiveness.
- Review your Product Backlog Refinement process to determine if it is helping create a clearer vision of what to achieve. Experiment with new approaches to make the process more efficient and valuable.
- Conduct a Scrum simulation with your team, ensuring that every element of the Scrum framework is used as defined in the Scrum Guide. Look for examples of such simulations online or design your own.
