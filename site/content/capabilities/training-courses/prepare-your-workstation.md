## [ACTION] Prepare your Workstation [ESSENTIAL]

Running & participating in live virtual classes is hard work. We do a lot to prepare our workstations, create the Murals, and set up Teams. It's really important to us that you donâ€™t have a bad experience. Here are some things we have found helpful!

### Having the Right Equipment

- **A computer capable of running Mural**
  - [Connecting to MURAL best practices | MURAL Help Center](https://mural.co/help-center)
- **A device capable of running Microsoft Teams**
  - It's okay to join from a phone as long as we can see you.
- **A device capable of running Minecraft for Education**
- **Multi-Monitors** are recommended but not essential.

### Install MS Teams

- **Get MS Teams:** [Download Microsoft Teams](https://aka.ms/getteams)
  - For both Mac and Windows, it is recommended to install the app.
  - If you are joining from your phone, use the app from your app store.
  - **Note:** Mural does not work well enough from your phone.
- Microsoft Teams allows you to join from more than one device with the same login if that's how you use multiple screens. When connecting a second device, make sure to "join with audio off" to avoid feedback.

### Install Minecraft for Education

- **Download Minecraft Education**
  - It is available for Windows, Mac, Android, or iPhone/iPad. For best results and ease of access, please use a device with a large screen and a mouse and keyboard.

### Enable Additional Tools (Optional)

- **Krisp Noise Cancelling** - This link provides 2 months free! Even with a lawnmower outside or a dog barking nearby, Krisp ensures your students hear only you.
