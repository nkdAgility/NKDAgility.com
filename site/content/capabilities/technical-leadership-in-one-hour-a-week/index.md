      title: "\U0001F680 1 Hour a Week to Thriving Leadership"
      subtitle: Build Confidence. Drive Outcomes. Lead with Technical Clarity.
      content: |
        Most managers are promoted into leadership without any training, coaching, or mentorship.  
        According to **Gallup**, 65% of managers never receive formal training in their role, yet they’re expected to lead teams through complex engineering practices in fast‑moving, competitive environments.

        That’s why Martin Hinshelwood created a simple but powerful solution: **one hour a week** of focused leadership transformation.
