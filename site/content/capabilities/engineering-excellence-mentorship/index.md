      title: Your engineers aren't the problem.
      content: |
        You've hired talented developers. You've invested in infrastructure. You've set ambitious goals.

        So why does shipping software still feel like fighting through quicksand?

    title: Your roadmap keeps slipping. Your best people keep leaving. Your technical debt keeps growing.
    subtitle: Your engineers are smart. Your product vision is solid. But somewhere between code commit and customer value, everything breaks down.

      **The daily reality:**

      - Releases that terrify everyone because deployment is a high-wire act
      - Features that take months when they should take weeks
      - "Simple changes" that cascade into system-wide failures
      - Engineers who joined excited but now seem defeated
      - Executives asking again why competitors are moving faster
        
      You've tried reorganizations. New tools. Process improvements. More meetings. Fewer meetings.

      **But here's what nobody tells you:**

      Software engineering excellence isn't about your process framework.
      It's not about whether you call it "Agile" or "traditional" or something in between.
      It's about building a system of practices that let talented engineers do their best work—consistently, sustainably, and with pride.
      Most teams never get there. Not because they lack talent. Because no one shows them how.

    title: The gap between struggling teams and high-performing teams isn't methodology.
    subtitle: It's engineering practice.

      Spotify doesn't ship with confidence because of how they organize teams.

      Netflix doesn't deploy hundreds of times per day because of their process framework.

      Amazon doesn't scale to millions of customers because they follow a particular methodology.

      **They mastered the engineering fundamentals.**

      They built environments where code quality, deployment confidence, architectural clarity, and continuous improvement aligned—every single day.

      **And here's the breakthrough:**

      You don't need to wait years for transformation.

      You don't need to rip out your entire system.

      You don't need a six-month consulting engagement that disrupts everything.

      You need one hour. Every week. With someone who's engineered it.

    title: Meet the engineer who's transformed 250+ software teams from chaos to excellence.

      **Martin Hinshelwood** isn't a process consultant. He's an engineer.

      - 17-year Microsoft MVP in DevOps, recognized for real-world impact on software delivery, year after year
      - Professional Scrum Trainer, but more importantly, an expert in engineering practices that transcend any framework
      - 1,00+ engagements across the US, UK, and Europe, from 5-person startups to Fortune 500 engineering organizations
      - Engineering excellence, lived daily, not taught from theory, but forged in production environments under real pressure

      *Martin has debugged the systems you're fighting.*

      He's mentored the overwhelmed tech leads. He's coached the frustrated engineering managers. He's guided the CTOs who know something's broken but can't see what.

      **And he's distilled decades of software engineering wisdom into one accessible format:**

      60 minutes a week. Your team. Real problems. Real solutions.

    title: What happens when engineering excellence becomes your competitive advantage?
    subtitle: |
      This isn't about adopting a new framework. This is about transforming how your team **builds, ships, and evolves** software.
    cards:
      - content: |
          **Week 1:** You bring your biggest blocker. Martin helps you see what you've been missing. You leave with a concrete improvement your team implements immediately.
      - content: |
          **Month 1:** Deployments start feeling less scary. Code reviews become learning opportunities instead of bottlenecks. Engineers start seeing the path forward.
      - content: |
          **Month 3:** Technical debt stops compounding. Your architecture decisions create options instead of constraints. Quality improves while velocity increases.
      - content: |
          **Month 6:** Deployment confidence becomes your superpower. Time from code-complete to customer value shrinks dramatically. Engineers stop talking about leaving.
      - content: |
          **Month 12:** Your team embodies engineering excellence. You're not just shipping faster—you're shipping better. Competitors wonder how you accelerate while they slow down. Top talent wants to join you.

    title: 60 minutes. Every week. Consulting, coaching, and mentorship fused into one.
    content: |
      This isn't a certification program you complete and forget.
      This isn't consulting where someone hands you a 200-slide deck and disappears.
      This is active, **in-the-code mentorship**, tailored to your team's actual challenges, delivered with the rhythm of weekly momentum.

          ### The Rhythm: 

          Week 1: Diagnose and identify quick wins 

          Week 2: Implement and learn from results 

          Week 3: Deepen practices and address root causes 

          Week 4: Reflect, consolidate, and plan ahead

          Every month, you build momentum. Every quarter, you look back and barely recognize the engineering organization you were.

    subtitle: Engineering excellence
    content: |
      Martin doesn't theorize about software engineering, he transforms it.

      The Track Record:
      - **17 consecutive years as Microsoft MVP** - a recognition reserved for those who demonstrably advance the software industry
      - **1,000+ engagements across three continents** - from chaotic startups to enterprise-scale transformations
      - **Expert in DevOps, CI/CD, and engineering excellence** - the practices that separate high-performing teams from everyone else

      #### What Engineering Leaders Say:

      *“Thanks to Martin's guidance and support we successfully upgraded to TFS 2010 from an unstable TFS 2005 database, moved our dev team to Visual Studio 2010 and implemented the finest product build process ever known!*
       
      *I would recommend Martin to anyone, in fact I would insist they use him as he's the best ALM consultant I've worked with.”*

          You know the cost of inaction.

          Releases that keep slipping.

          Incidents that keep happening.

          Engineers who stop caring.

          Customers who stop trusting.

          **Excellence delayed is opportunity lost.**

          The teams shipping with confidence today aren't smarter than you.

          They aren't better funded.

          They just had someone show them **how**.

          **This is your moment.**

          The hour-a-week that transforms the next 12 months.

          The investment that turns your team from "constantly firefighting" into "consistently shipping excellence."

          The mentorship that makes engineering capability your competitive advantage.

    title: Your engineering excellence journey starts with one conversation.
    content: |
      Book your first session with Martin.

      Bring your biggest engineering challenge, the technical debt that's crushing you, the deployment pipeline that terrifies everyone, the architecture decision you're stuck on, the quality issues you can't seem to solve.

      In 60 minutes, you'll walk away with:

      - Clarity on your next right move
      - A concrete improvement you can implement this week
      - A roadmap for the transformation ahead
      - 
      **If it's not the most valuable hour your engineering team has spent in months, we'll refund you immediately.**

      That's how confident we are that this works.
