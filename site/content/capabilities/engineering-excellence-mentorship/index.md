      title: Your engineers aren't the problem.
      content: |
        You've hired talented developers. You've invested in infrastructure. You've set ambitious goals.

        So why does shipping software still feel like fighting through quicksand?

    title: Your roadmap keeps slipping. Your best people keep leaving. Your technical debt keeps growing.
    subtitle: Your engineers are smart. Your product vision is solid. But somewhere between code commit and customer value, everything breaks down.

      **The daily reality:**

      - Releases that terrify everyone because deployment is a high-wire act
      - Features that take months when they should take weeks
      - "Simple changes" that cascade into system-wide failures
      - Engineers who joined excited but now seem defeated
      - Executives asking again why competitors are moving faster
        
      You've tried reorganizations. New tools. Process improvements. More meetings. Fewer meetings.

      **But here's what nobody tells you:**

      Software engineering excellence isn't about your process framework.
      It's not about whether you call it "Agile" or "traditional" or something in between.
      It's about building a system of practices that let talented engineers do their best work—consistently, sustainably, and with pride.
      Most teams never get there. Not because they lack talent. Because no one shows them how.

    title: The gap between struggling teams and high-performing teams isn't methodology.
    subtitle: It's engineering practice.
    content: |
      Spotify doesn't ship with confidence because of how they organize teams.

      Netflix doesn't deploy hundreds of times per day because of their process framework.

      Amazon doesn't scale to millions of customers because they follow a particular methodology.

      **They mastered the engineering fundamentals.**

      They built environments where code quality, deployment confidence, architectural clarity, and continuous improvement aligned—every single day.

      **And here's the breakthrough:**

      You don't need to wait years for transformation.

      You don't need to rip out your entire system.

      You don't need a six-month consulting engagement that disrupts everything.

      You need one hour. Every week. With someone who's engineered it.

    title: What happens when engineering excellence becomes your competitive advantage?
    subtitle: |
      This isn't about adopting a new framework.

      This is about transforming how your team builds, ships, and evolves software.
    cards:
      - content: |
          **Week 1:** You bring your biggest blocker. Martin helps you see what you've been missing. You leave with a concrete improvement your team implements immediately.
      - content: |
          **Month 1:** Deployments start feeling less scary. Code reviews become learning opportunities instead of bottlenecks. Engineers start seeing the path forward.
      - content: |
          **Month 3:** Technical debt stops compounding. Your architecture decisions create options instead of constraints. Quality improves while velocity increases.
      - content: |
          **Month 6:** Deployment confidence becomes your superpower. Time from code-complete to customer value shrinks dramatically. Engineers stop talking about leaving.
      - content: |
          **Month 12:** Your team embodies engineering excellence. You're not just shipping faster—you're shipping better. Competitors wonder how you accelerate while they slow down. Top talent wants to join you.
