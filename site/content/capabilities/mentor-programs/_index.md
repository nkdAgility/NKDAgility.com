        You don’t need more frameworks, more certifications, or another backlog refinement template.
        You need **product teams that think clearly, collaborate deeply, and deliver outcomes that matter**.

        That’s why we offer two mentorship programs, built for two distinct but critical growth journeys.

    title: Why Training Alone Isn’t Enough
    content: |
      Product development is complex. Product management is political.

      And your teams are under pressure to deliver now.

      The truth?

      - Most POs aren’t trained to lead across business + tech
      - Most teams are drowning in backlog noise, not aligned outcomes
      - Discovery and delivery are still separate islands
      - And everyone is too busy to stop and learn

      **Mentorship fixes what training alone can’t: capability in the flow of work.**

      "...the impact your training is having on my staff... I expected them to be drained and [...] grumpy. But they were absolutely fired up – buzzing with excitement, ideas, and getting into great discussion about making the business better.

      [...] The impact you’re having is pretty amazing. They spoke very highly of your ability in the sessions and how you brought things to life."
