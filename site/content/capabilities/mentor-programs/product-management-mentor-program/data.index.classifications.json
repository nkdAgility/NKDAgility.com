No discussion is dedicated to the benefits, practices, or challenges of transparency. The content is primarily aimed at product managers and Agile leaders, who fit the audience for transparency discussions. Most of the description is on broader Agile/product management skills, with only slight overlap with transparency themes.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content broadly targets Agile leaders and covers related topics like stakeholder alignment and communication, but it does not directly address or emphasize transparency, its techniques, or challenges. Any alignment with transparency is incidental rather than a core focus.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on mentoring product managers in Agile, UX, and evidence-based management but contains no explicit or implicit mention of agentic software delivery or integrating autonomous agents. Topics align with product management, not with AI agent integration, contextual intelligence, or agent governance. The only slight overlap is general advocacy of innovation and modern practices, but without coverage of agentic approaches, autonomous agents, or AI-driven process transformation. The audience has potential overlap (technical/product leads), but the actual course content is unrelated to the agentic delivery category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is focused on Agile product management, not Agentic Software Delivery. No discussion of AI agents, agentic principles, or software delivery automation, thus fit is low except some relevance for practitioner audience.",
