      Are you struggling with the implications of a move to a product organisation and how to develop vision, value, and validation in place of the traditional structures?

      This tier introduces the theory of a successful product organisation and crystalises it through curated practices and guided implementation within your organisation. This value-driven product development approach uses evidence-based management, lean backlog management, and stakeholder engagement practices that enable an adaptive approach to staying ahead of market changes.
