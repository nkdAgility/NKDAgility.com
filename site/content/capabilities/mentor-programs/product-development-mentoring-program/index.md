      - title: "Phase 1: Applying Agile Engineering"
        content: |
          Are you grappling with the complexities of adopting Agile practices and the challenges of aligning them with engineering principles within your organization?

          This course segment introduces the foundational theories of Agile Product Development, emphasizing its integration with engineering excellence. We crystallize these concepts through carefully selected practices and guided application in your organization. This engineering-focused development approach leverages efficient workflow optimization, and collaborative team dynamics, fostering a culture that readily adapts to technological advances and market shifts.

          As part of this phase, we use the accredited [Applying Professional Scrum (APS)](/capabilities/training-courses/scrumorg-applying-professional-scrum) Course training course and every participant received 2 attempts at the [Professional Scrum Master™ I Certification (PSM I)](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-master-i-certification).

      - title: "Phase 2: Agile Product Development"
        content: |
          Navigating the complexities of software development and team dynamics within Scrum can be overwhelming, from maintaining high code quality to managing stakeholder expectations and ensuring timely delivery.

          This segment offers a comprehensive solution by diving deep into the Scrum framework, enabling participants to master working within a Scrum Team, defining clear completion criteria, and managing backlogs efficiently. It emphasizes practical skills in code quality improvement, tackling technical debt, and incorporating Agile architectural practices. Through hands-on approaches like Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Agile Testing, the course ensures that quality is embedded in every phase of development. Furthermore, by integrating DevOps practices with Scrum, it provides a holistic approach to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and deliver superior products, thus equipping participants with the tools and mindset needed to excel in Agile software development environments.

          As part of this phase, we use the accredited [Applying Professional Scrum for Software Development (APS-SD)](/capabilities/training-courses/scrumorg-applying-professional-scrum-for-software-development) Course, and every participant received two attempts at the [Professional Scrum Developer™ Certification](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-developer-certification).

      - title: "Phase 3: Enhancing Engineering with Flow"
        content: |
          In software development environments, achieving a seamless workflow, effectively managing work in progress (WIP), and ensuring delivery predictability, while maintaining transparency and adaptability, are common challenges teams face.

          This segment aims to tackle these issues by offering an in-depth exploration of flow principles and Kanban practices, tailored for software development teams. Participants will learn to use Kanban to enhance the efficiency of their development processes, significantly improving project outcomes. Key focuses include increasing project transparency and enhancing predictability by visualizing workflows and utilizing data to establish a team’s Service Level Expectation (SLE). Moreover, by applying flow principles and Kanban practices to daily development activities, participants will be equipped to effectively manage WIP and address prevalent workflow challenges. This strategic and practical knowledge empowers teams to deliver high-quality software predictably and efficiently.

          Included with this phase is access to the accredited [Professional Scrum with Kanban (PSK)](/capabilities/training-courses/scrumorg-professional-scrum-with-kanban) Course and two atempts at the [Professional Scrum™ with Kanban Certification](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/professional-scrum-with-kanban-certification).

      - title: "Phase 4: Engineering Excelance at Scale"
        content: |
          As software development projects scale, they often encounter complex challenges such as process inefficiencies, detrimental effects of cross-team dependencies, and the struggle to align multiple teams for unified value delivery.

          This segment introduces essential principles and techniques for scaling software development effectively, tackling common challenges like process inefficiencies and cross-team dependencies. Learners will discover how to adjust the scale of their processes for optimal performance, including simplification strategies. The focus will include practical methods for minimizing and eliminating dependencies to foster better team collaboration. Using the Nexus framework as a practical example, the segment offers insights into organizing teams and work for unified value delivery across a larger development effort, ensuring a cohesive approach to scaling.

          As part of this phase, we use the accredited [Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS)](/capabilities/training-courses/scrumorg-scaled-professional-scrum-with-nexus) Course and all participants gain receive two attempts at the [Scaled Professional Scrum™ Certification](https://www.scrum.org/assessments/scaled-professional-scrum-certification).
