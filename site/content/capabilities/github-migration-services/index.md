    title: Why Migrate from TFS to GitHub?
    content: |
      **Staying on TFS means staying stuck.**

      TFS is built for an era that no longer exists. In contrast, GitHub offers:

      - Modern, cloud-native CI/CD pipelines
      - Built-in security, secrets management, and compliance
      -  Collaboration at scale with pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions
      - Integration with AI-powered developer tools like Copilot

      But most importantly: **GitHub lets your teams move faster, safer, and smarter.**
