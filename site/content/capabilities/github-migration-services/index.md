      subtitle: Unlock Modern Software Delivery. Ditch Legacy TFS. Move with Confidence.

        Your teams are still shipping from Team Foundation Server. You know it’s slowing you down. But the migration to GitHub feels risky, code history, permissions, workflows, integrations… it’s a lot.

        **That’s where NKD Agility comes in.** We help engineering organizations migrate from TFS (or Azure DevOps Server) to GitHub with **clarity, control, and zero guesswork**, so you can future-proof your development pipeline without disrupting delivery.

    title: Why Migrate from TFS to GitHub?
    content: |
      **Staying on TFS means staying stuck.**

      TFS is built for an era that no longer exists. In contrast, GitHub offers:

      - Modern, cloud-native CI/CD pipelines
      - Built-in security, secrets management, and compliance
      -  Collaboration at scale with pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions
      - Integration with AI-powered developer tools like Copilot

      But most importantly: **GitHub lets your teams move faster, safer, and smarter.**
