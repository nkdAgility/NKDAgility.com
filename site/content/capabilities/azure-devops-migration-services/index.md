    title: Why Most DevOps Migrations Fail
    content: |
      Most DevOps migrations stall because vendors focus on tools—not transformation.

      Leaders are left with:

      - Half-baked pipelines they don’t own
      - Vendor lock-in that drains budgets
      - Teams untrained in the new toolchain
      - Technical debt repackaged in a shinier wrapper

      **We do it differently.**

      We elevate your engineering culture while building scalable, secure, maintainable pipelines your team actually understands and owns.
