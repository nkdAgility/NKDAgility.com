title: Application Lifecycle Management
description: Optimise Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) to enhance software development, delivery, and maintenance.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Application Lifecycle Management.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses the strategies, practices, and tools used to manage the entire lifecycle of an application from initial planning through development, deployment, maintenance, and eventual retirement. The purpose is to optimise processes to enhance software development, delivery, and maintenance, ensuring that applications meet business needs and user expectations effectively.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - Overview of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) principles and frameworks.
  - Integration of Agile methodologies within ALM practices.
  - Role of DevOps in streamlining application delivery and operations.
  - Tools and technologies that support ALM, including CI/CD pipelines.
  - Best practices for managing requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment.
  - Strategies for maintaining application quality and performance throughout its lifecycle.
  - Change management and version control in the context of ALM.
  - Metrics and KPIs for measuring ALM effectiveness and efficiency.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the management of application lifecycles, such as general software development practices that do not consider the holistic view of an application's journey, or topics that focus solely on isolated phases of development without considering the entire lifecycle.
