description: Applying Lean principles to rapidly test and validate business ideas with minimal risk.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Lean Startup.**  
  The Lean Startup category focuses on the application of Lean principles to efficiently test and validate business ideas, minimising risk and maximising learning through iterative cycles. This approach encourages entrepreneurs to build a minimum viable product (MVP), measure its performance in the market, and learn from the feedback to refine their offerings.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - The concept of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and its role in testing hypotheses.
  - The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop and its importance in product development.
  - Validated learning and how it informs decision-making in startups.
  - Techniques for rapid experimentation and pivoting based on market feedback.
  - The role of customer development in understanding user needs and market fit.
  - Lean metrics versus traditional metrics for assessing startup performance.
  - Case studies illustrating successful Lean Startup implementations.

  **Strictly exclude** unrelated content or misinterpretations of the core classification, such as general business management practices that do not specifically apply Lean principles, discussions on established corporate strategies without a focus on innovation, or any content that does not emphasise the iterative learning process central to the Lean Startup methodology.
