title: Experimentation
description: Using hypothesis-driven approaches to test ideas and validate assumptions in agile workflows.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Experimentation.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the application of hypothesis-driven approaches within Agile workflows, focusing on how experimentation can validate assumptions and drive continuous improvement. This includes the systematic testing of ideas to enhance decision-making and foster innovation in Agile practices.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Hypothesis formulation and testing in Agile environments.
  - The role of experimentation in validating product features and user feedback.
  - Techniques for conducting experiments, such as A/B testing and user testing.
  - The integration of experimentation into Agile ceremonies and processes.
  - Learning from experiments: how to analyse results and iterate based on findings.
  - The impact of experimentation on team dynamics and organisational culture.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful experimentation in Agile projects.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile principles without a focus on experimentation.
  - Misinterpretations of experimentation that do not align with hypothesis-driven methodologies.
  - Content that does not relate to testing ideas or validating assumptions within Agile workflows.
