Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Self Organisation.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the principles and practices that enable teams to operate autonomously, take ownership of their work, and drive value without excessive oversight. Self-organisation is a fundamental aspect of Agile methodologies, promoting empowerment, accountability, and collaboration within teams.

  **Key topics to be discussed under this category:**
  - The principles of self-organisation in Agile and Scrum frameworks.
  - Techniques for fostering a culture of autonomy and trust within teams.
  - The role of leadership in supporting self-organising teams.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful self-organisation in practice.
  - The impact of self-organisation on team performance and delivery.
  - Tools and practices that facilitate self-organisation, such as retrospectives and team agreements.
  - The relationship between self-organisation and other Agile principles, such as collaboration and continuous improvement.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that focus on traditional management practices, micromanagement, or hierarchical decision-making structures, as these contradict the core philosophy of self-organisation. Additionally, avoid content that misinterprets self-organisation as a lack of structure or guidance, as effective self-organisation still requires clear goals and support mechanisms.
