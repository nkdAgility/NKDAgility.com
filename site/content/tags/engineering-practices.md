  **Use this category only for discussions on Engineering Practices.**  
  This category encompasses the fundamental principles and methodologies that underpin Agile development, focusing on the importance of clean code, automation, and test-first development. It aims to promote high-quality software engineering practices that enhance collaboration, efficiency, and adaptability within Agile teams.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Clean Code: Principles and practices for writing maintainable and readable code, as advocated by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler.
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD): The practice of writing tests before code to ensure functionality and facilitate refactoring, as outlined in the works of Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries.
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Strategies for automating the integration and delivery of code changes, as discussed by Jez Humble and Gene Kim.
  - Refactoring: Techniques for improving the structure of existing code without changing its external behaviour, as highlighted by Martin Fowler.
  - Automation: The use of tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks in the development process, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error.
  - Pair Programming: A collaborative approach to coding where two developers work together at one workstation, promoting knowledge sharing and code quality.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that deviate from the core principles of Agile engineering practices, such as project management methodologies unrelated to software development, non-technical topics, or personal opinions that do not align with established Agile philosophies.

  content: |-
    This classification focuses on the essential engineering practices that underpin Agile methodologies, emphasising the importance of clean code, automation, and test-first development. It serves as a guide for teams looking to enhance their software delivery processes, ensuring that quality and efficiency are at the forefront of their work. 

    Posts in this category should explore key topics such as code quality, continuous integration and delivery, automated testing, and the principles of Lean and DevOps. Additionally, connections to frameworks like Kanban and insights from thought leaders in Agile and Evidence-Based Management can provide valuable context and practical applications for these practices in real-world scenarios.
