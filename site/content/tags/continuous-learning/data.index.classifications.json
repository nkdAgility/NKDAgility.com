    "reasoning": "This content primarily discusses the importance of fostering a learning culture, growth mindset, and continuous adaptation within teams—it is not focused on the explicit measurement, monitoring, or discussion of 'Current Value' as defined in Evidence-Based Management (EBM). \n\n- Mentions (1.3): The phrase 'value delivery' and 'customer satisfaction' occurs towards the end, but there is no explicit discussion or direct naming of 'Current Value' or its formal application in EBM.\n- Alignment (3.6): While the content relates to delivering value and improvement, its primary concepts—growth mindset, learning, knowledge sharing—are only tangentially linked to Current Value and not to its specific metrics or real-time assessment aspects.\n- Depth (3.2): The discussion remains high level, focusing on cultural and team benefits rather than any substantial exploration or measurement of value indicators, customer feedback, or evidence-based evaluation.\n- Intent (3.7): The intent is to advocate for continuous learning as a beneficial practice for team improvement and, indirectly, value generation, but not specifically for measuring or understanding Current Value within EBM.\n- Audience (5.8): The content is relevant for Agile/Tech practitioners and leaders, similar to the intended audience for Current Value discussions, though it is broader and more general in focus.\n- Signal (7.5): The messaging is clear, focused, and mostly on-topic for agile improvement culture, though not specifically on Current Value; minimal unrelated filler is present.\n\nNo penalties were applied, as the tone is current and not critical. Overall, the content’s connection to 'Current Value' is rather indirect and conceptual, earning it a low-confidence, tertiary-level fit.",

    "reasoning": "Mentions (2.2): The content does not explicitly mention 'Organisational Psychology' or named theories (e.g., Maslow, Herzberg), but does reference related concepts like 'growth mindset', 'organisational culture', 'team dynamics', and 'resilience', which directly touch on psychological topics in an organisational context. Alignment (8.5): The content conceptually aligns with organisational psychology by focusing on group behaviour, team learning, and cultural aspects that influence employee and organisational performance. Key themes are motivation, engagement, adaptation, and psychological factors underpinning team success. Depth (8.8): The piece goes beyond superficial coverage—explaining mechanisms (reflection, experimentation, collective intelligence) and linking learning to culture, resilience, and innovation, providing depth beyond just stating continuous learning as a value. Intent (8.6): The primary purpose is to promote the psychological and organisational value of continuous learning, supporting enhanced team and individual performance. It is on-purpose for the category, aiming to inform and motivate application of psychological principles. Audience (8.3): Written for an audience interested in organisational improvement—likely leaders, managers, and practitioners familiar with psychological principles in business, though not strictly academic or specialist. Signal (7.9): The text is focused on continuous learning’s psychological and cultural implications, with little tangential or filler content; however, it makes broad claims about 'value delivery' and 'customer satisfaction' that slightly dilute focus from psychological mechanisms. No penalties apply—the content is current, positive in tone, and does not undermine or satirise the category. Level is set to 'Secondary' because while the coverage is substantial and closely aligns to organisational psychology, it doesn't directly cite psychological theories or label itself as an explicit organisational psychology resource.",

    "reasoning": "This content primarily focuses on the concept of Continuous Learning within teams, emphasizing growth mindset, knowledge sharing, and adaptability. While it discusses themes related to team collaboration, knowledge sharing, and improved performance—which are also relevant to cross-functional teams—it never explicitly references 'cross-functional teams,' nor does it detail their unique structure or role in Agile methodologies. \n\n- Mentions (0.7): There are no direct mentions of 'cross-functional teams' or related keywords. The content speaks generically about 'teams' and 'team dynamics,' but does not specify or emphasize the cross-functional aspect.\n- Alignment (7.0): There is moderate alignment as the content touches on team-level knowledge sharing and performance; however, it is more about learning dynamics in general teams rather than specifically within cross-functional teams as defined. \n- Depth (7.3): The discussion is substantive regarding continuous learning, providing analysis on benefits, approaches, and impacts at the team and organizational level; however, it does not dive deeply into best practices, challenges, or the unique characteristics of cross-functional teams.\n- Intent (5.5): The main intent is to promote continuous learning for teams generally, not cross-functional teams in particular. Its relevance is tangential rather than direct.\n- Audience (5.2): The audience is broad—applicable to anyone involved in team improvement initiatives, including but not limited to Agile or cross-functional teams. It isn’t tailored to practitioners or strategists looking for guidance on cross-functional team structures.\n- Signal (7.9): The piece is focused and maintains high topical relevance regarding team-related improvement, though slightly lower due to being somewhat off the strict category topic.\n\nNo penalties were applied, as the content does not reference obsolete practices nor contradict the framing. Overall, the relevance to cross-functional teams is tertiary: it is tangential by virtue of shared themes but lacks direct or substantial exploration of the category.",
