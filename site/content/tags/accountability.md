Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Accountability.**  
  The category of Accountability in Agile focuses on the principle of ownership within teams, emphasising that accountability is about taking responsibility for commitments rather than assigning blame. This fosters an environment of trust, collaboration, and high performance, which is essential for successful Agile practices.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The distinction between accountability and blame in Agile teams.
  - The role of ownership in team dynamics and performance.
  - Strategies for fostering a culture of accountability within Agile frameworks.
  - The impact of accountability on team trust and collaboration.
  - Case studies or examples illustrating successful accountability practices in Agile environments.
  - The relationship between accountability and team commitments in Scrum and Kanban.
  - Tools and techniques for measuring and enhancing accountability in Agile teams.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that conflate accountability with punitive measures or blame.
  - Content that does not relate to team dynamics or ownership in the context of Agile methodologies.
  - Misinterpretations of accountability that suggest it is solely an individual responsibility rather than a collective team principle.
