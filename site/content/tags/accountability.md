title: Accountability
description: In Agile, accountability is about ownership, not blame. Teams own their commitments, fostering trust and high performance.
Instructions: Use this category only for discussions on accountability in Scrum and Agile. Topics should focus on the distinct accountabilities of Scrum roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developers), fostering ownership, ensuring alignment with Agile principles, and driving organisational responsibility. General discussions on responsibility, leadership, or team dynamics outside Scrum and Agile should be placed in other relevant categories.
