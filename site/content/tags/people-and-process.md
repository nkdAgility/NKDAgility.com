title: People and Process
description: Optimising the human and procedural elements of agile teams and organisations.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on People and Process.**  
  This category focuses on optimising the human and procedural elements within Agile teams and organisations. It encompasses the interactions, roles, and workflows that contribute to effective team dynamics and organisational efficiency.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Team roles and responsibilities in Agile frameworks (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team)
  - Collaboration and communication practices within Agile teams
  - Techniques for enhancing team performance and engagement
  - Process improvement methodologies (e.g., retrospectives, feedback loops)
  - The impact of organisational culture on Agile adoption
  - Strategies for managing team dynamics and conflict resolution
  - Training and development for Agile competencies
  - Alignment of team processes with Agile principles and values

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that focus solely on technical practices, tools, or frameworks without reference to the human or procedural aspects of Agile methodologies. Misinterpretations of the core classification, such as those that do not consider the interplay between people and processes, should also be omitted.
