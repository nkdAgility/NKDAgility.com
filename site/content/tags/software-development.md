Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Software Development.**  
  The Software Development category encompasses techniques, methodologies, and practices aimed at producing high-quality software engineering outcomes. This category focuses on the processes and frameworks that guide the development lifecycle, ensuring that software is built efficiently, effectively, and sustainably.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall, Iterative)
  - Best practices in coding and software design (e.g., SOLID principles, design patterns)
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
  - Version control systems and collaborative development (e.g., Git, GitHub)
  - Code quality assurance techniques (e.g., code reviews, static analysis)
  - Software architecture and system design principles
  - Agile frameworks and practices (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)
  - DevOps practices and their integration into software development
  - Evidence-Based Management in software projects

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to software engineering practices, such as general business management topics, unrelated technology discussions, or personal opinions on software tools without a methodological context.
