The focus remains on realised value and routine prioritisation.\n- **Depth of Discussion (2.200):** The discussion is reasonably thorough about what a Product Owner does, but does not go deep into methods or frameworks for uncovering or acting on Unrealised Value specifically.\n- **Intent / Purpose Fit (2.000):** The intent is to inform about the accountability of a Product Owner, not to discuss unrealised (potential) value or to explore strategies for finding new value opportunities within the organisation.\n- **Audience Alignment (9.100):** The content is aimed at practitioners (Product Owners, Scrum teams)—a relevant, likely audience for EBM topics, but not sufficient to warrant a higher score without alignment in other areas.\n- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (7.900):** Most of the content is focused and relevant to product owners and agile practices; little extraneous or unrelated material.\n\nNo penalties were applied, as there are no outdated references or contradiction of the Unrealised Value frame; the tone and material are appropriate but not aligned deeply with this category.
