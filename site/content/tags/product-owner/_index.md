Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Product Owner.**  
  The Product Owner is a key role in Agile and Scrum frameworks, responsible for maximising product value through effective backlog management and stakeholder alignment. This category focuses on the responsibilities, skills, and practices that define the Product Owner's role in delivering successful products.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Responsibilities of the Product Owner in Agile and Scrum
  - Techniques for effective backlog management
  - Prioritisation strategies for product features and user stories
  - Stakeholder engagement and communication
  - Understanding customer needs and translating them into product requirements
  - Collaboration with development teams to ensure clarity and alignment
  - Metrics and tools for measuring product value and success
  - The role of the Product Owner in Agile ceremonies (e.g., sprint planning, reviews)
  - Challenges faced by Product Owners and strategies to overcome them

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to the Product Owner role, such as technical implementation details, team dynamics unrelated to the Product Owner, or general Agile/Scrum principles that do not specifically address the Product Owner's responsibilities. Misinterpretations of the Product Owner's role, such as conflating it with that of a Scrum Master or development team member, should also be excluded.
