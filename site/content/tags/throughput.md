  **Use this category only for discussions on Throughput.**  
  Throughput refers to the measurement of the rate at which work items are completed within a specified time frame. This category focuses on understanding and optimising the flow of work in Agile, DevOps, and Lean environments, emphasising the importance of delivering value efficiently.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and significance of throughput in Agile and DevOps contexts.
  - Techniques for measuring throughput, including cycle time and lead time.
  - The impact of throughput on team performance and delivery timelines.
  - Strategies for improving throughput, such as limiting work in progress (WIP) and optimising workflows.
  - The relationship between throughput and other metrics, such as velocity and capacity.
  - Case studies or examples illustrating throughput improvements in real-world scenarios.
  - Tools and practices that support the measurement and enhancement of throughput.

  **Strictly exclude:**  
  Discussions unrelated to the measurement and optimisation of work completion rates, such as general project management practices, unrelated Agile methodologies, or non-technical topics. Misinterpretations of throughput that do not align with its definition in the context of Agile, DevOps, and Lean philosophies should also be excluded.

    Throughput is all about understanding how quickly work items move through your process, giving you insights into your team's efficiency and flow. Itâ€™s a key metric in Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps that helps you identify bottlenecks and optimise delivery. By measuring throughput, you can make informed decisions that enhance your workflow and improve overall performance.

    Posts in this classification should explore topics like the principles of Kanban, the role of throughput in Agile and Scrum frameworks, and its significance in Lean and DevOps practices. You might also delve into how throughput relates to Evidence-Based Management and Complexity Theory, providing a well-rounded view of how to effectively manage and improve work processes in dynamic environments.
