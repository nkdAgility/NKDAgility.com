Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Customer Feedback Loops.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the mechanisms and practices that facilitate the integration of customer feedback into the product development process, ensuring that products are aligned with user needs and expectations. This includes methods for collecting, analysing, and acting on feedback to enhance product quality and customer satisfaction.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The importance of customer feedback in Agile and Lean methodologies.
  - Techniques for gathering customer insights (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing).
  - The role of feedback loops in iterative development and continuous improvement.
  - Strategies for integrating feedback into the product backlog and prioritisation processes.
  - Case studies demonstrating effective feedback loop implementations.
  - Tools and frameworks that support customer feedback collection and analysis.
  - The impact of customer feedback on team dynamics and decision-making.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the processes of collecting and utilising customer feedback, such as general product management practices that do not emphasise feedback integration, or unrelated Agile and DevOps concepts that do not focus on the feedback loop mechanism.
