Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Agile Philosophy.**  
  The Agile Philosophy encompasses the foundational principles and values that guide Agile practices and frameworks, focusing on delivering value through collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. It transcends specific methodologies, advocating for a mindset that prioritises customer satisfaction and adaptive planning.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The Agile Manifesto and its 12 principles
  - Value delivery and customer collaboration
  - The role of teams and individuals in Agile environments
  - Continuous improvement and feedback loops
  - The importance of adaptability and responsiveness to change
  - Cultural shifts required for Agile adoption
  - The impact of Agile philosophy on organisational structure and behaviour
  - Differences between Agile philosophy and specific frameworks (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Technical discussions on specific Agile frameworks without reference to the underlying philosophy
  - Misinterpretations of Agile as merely a set of practices or tools
  - Content that does not address the broader implications of Agile as a mindset or ethos
