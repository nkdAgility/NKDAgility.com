  The Product Owner is a key role in Agile and Scrum frameworks, responsible for maximising product value through effective backlog management and stakeholder alignment. This category focuses on the responsibilities, skills, and practices that define the Product Owner's role in delivering successful products.

  **Key Topics:**

Misinterpretations of the Product Owner's role, such as conflating it with that of a Scrum Master or development team member, should also be excluded.
