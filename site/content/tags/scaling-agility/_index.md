description: Moving beyond frameworks to build agility at every level.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Scaling Agility.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore strategies and practices that enable organisations to extend agile principles and methodologies beyond individual teams, fostering a culture of agility at all levels of the organisation. This includes the integration of agile practices into larger organisational structures and processes, ensuring that agility is not confined to specific teams but is a fundamental aspect of the organisation's operations.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - Frameworks for scaling agility, such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), LeSS (Large Scale Scrum), and Nexus.
  - The role of leadership in fostering an agile culture across the organisation.
  - Techniques for aligning multiple teams towards common goals and objectives.
  - The importance of cross-functional collaboration and communication in scaling agility.
  - Metrics and measurements for assessing agility at the organisational level.
  - Case studies and examples of successful scaling of agile practices in various industries.
  - Challenges and solutions in transitioning from team-level agility to enterprise-level agility.
  - The impact of organisational structure and design on the effectiveness of scaled agile practices.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that focus solely on team-level agile practices, unrelated methodologies, or misinterpretations of scaling agility that do not align with the core principles of agile philosophy and frameworks.
