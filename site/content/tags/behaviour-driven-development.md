Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Behaviour Driven Development.**  
  This category focuses on aligning software development processes with business objectives through Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). BDD enhances collaboration among stakeholders and ensures that requirements are clear, testable, and aligned with user needs.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles and practices of Behaviour Driven Development
  - The role of collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders
  - Writing effective user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Tools and frameworks used in BDD (e.g., Cucumber, SpecFlow)
  - The impact of BDD on software quality and delivery
  - Integration of BDD with Agile methodologies and DevOps practices
  - Techniques for fostering a shared understanding of requirements among teams

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of BDD, such as unrelated software development methodologies, general project management practices, or misinterpretations of BDD's purpose and implementation.
