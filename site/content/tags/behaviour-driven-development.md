  content: |-
    This classification focuses on Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), a collaborative approach that bridges the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. By emphasising shared understanding and clear communication, BDD helps ensure that development aligns closely with business goals, making it easier to create testable requirements that everyone can agree on.

    Posts in this category should explore key topics such as writing effective user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and fostering collaboration among cross-functional teams. Additionally, connections to Agile and Scrum principles, Lean methodologies, and DevOps practices can enhance the discussion, highlighting how BDD fits into broader frameworks for delivering value and managing complexity in software development.
