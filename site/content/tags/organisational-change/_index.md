  The scope of this category encompasses the strategies, methodologies, and practices involved in transforming an organisation to enhance agility and resilience. It focuses on the processes and frameworks that facilitate effective change management, ensuring that organisations can adapt to evolving market demands and internal dynamics.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - The principles and practices of Agile transformation.
  - Frameworks for implementing organisational change, such as the ADKAR model or Kotter's 8-Step Process.
  - The role of leadership in driving change and fostering a culture of agility.
  - Techniques for overcoming resistance to change within teams and departments.
  - The integration of Lean and Agile methodologies to streamline processes and improve efficiency.
  - Case studies and examples of successful organisational change initiatives.

  **Strictly exclude** unrelated content such as technical discussions on software development practices, specific coding techniques, or tools that do not directly relate to the organisational change process. Misinterpretations of the core classification, such as conflating organisational change with mere project management or operational efficiency without a focus on agility, should also be avoided.
