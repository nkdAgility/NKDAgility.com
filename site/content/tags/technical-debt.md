title: Technical Debt
description: Managing and reducing technical debt to maintain sustainable development velocity.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Technical Debt.**  
  The category of Technical Debt encompasses the concept of managing and reducing the accumulation of suboptimal code and design decisions that hinder sustainable development velocity. It highlights the trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term maintainability, emphasising the importance of addressing these debts to ensure a healthy codebase and efficient development processes.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and types of technical debt (e.g., intentional vs. unintentional)
  - Strategies for identifying and measuring technical debt
  - Impact of technical debt on team velocity and product quality
  - Techniques for prioritising technical debt remediation
  - Best practices for integrating technical debt management into Agile and DevOps workflows
  - Case studies illustrating the consequences of neglecting technical debt
  - Tools and methodologies for tracking and managing technical debt

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the management and implications of technical debt, such as unrelated software development practices, general project management topics, or misinterpretations of Agile and DevOps principles that do not consider the long-term sustainability of the codebase.
