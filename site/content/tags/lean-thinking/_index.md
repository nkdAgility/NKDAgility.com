Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Lean Thinking.**  
  Lean Thinking focuses on the application of Lean principles to minimise waste and enhance efficiency within workflows, ultimately aiming to create more value for customers with fewer resources.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles of Lean Thinking: Value, Value Stream, Flow, Pull, and Perfection.
  - Waste Identification: Types of waste (Muda) and strategies for elimination.
  - Continuous Improvement: Kaizen and its role in fostering a culture of ongoing enhancement.
  - Value Stream Mapping: Techniques for visualising and optimising processes.
  - Lean Tools and Techniques: 5S, Kanban, and Just-In-Time (JIT) production.
  - Lean Leadership: The role of leadership in promoting Lean practices and culture.
  - Integration with Agile and DevOps: How Lean Thinking complements Agile methodologies and DevOps practices.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that deviate from Lean principles, such as unrelated management theories, non-technical productivity hacks, or misinterpretations of Lean as merely cost-cutting measures.
