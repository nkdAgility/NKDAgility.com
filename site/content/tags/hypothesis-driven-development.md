title: Hypothesis Driven Development
description: Using experimentation and validated learning to drive product decisions.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Hypothesis Driven Development.**  
  This category focuses on the practice of using experimentation and validated learning to inform and guide product development decisions. It emphasises the importance of formulating hypotheses, conducting experiments to test these hypotheses, and using the results to make informed choices that enhance product value and user satisfaction.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Formulating and articulating clear hypotheses related to product features or user behaviours.
  - Designing and implementing experiments to test hypotheses, including A/B testing and user feedback mechanisms.
  - Analysing data and results from experiments to validate or invalidate hypotheses.
  - Iterating on product development based on insights gained from experimentation.
  - The role of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in measuring the success of hypotheses.
  - Case studies and examples of successful hypothesis-driven approaches in product development.
  - The relationship between hypothesis-driven development and Agile methodologies, including Scrum and Lean practices.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile or Scrum without a focus on hypothesis formulation and experimentation.
  - Content that does not involve empirical testing or data-driven decision-making.
  - Misinterpretations of hypothesis-driven development that do not align with the principles of validated learning and experimentation.
