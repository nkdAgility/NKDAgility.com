  **Use this category only for discussions on Value Stream Mapping.**  
  Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a Lean management technique used to visualise and analyse the flow of materials and information required to bring a product or service to the customer. Its primary purpose is to identify inefficiencies, eliminate waste, and optimise value delivery throughout the entire process.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Value Stream Mapping
  - Steps involved in creating a Value Stream Map
  - Identifying value-added and non-value-added activities
  - Techniques for analysing and improving workflows
  - The role of VSM in Lean and Agile methodologies
  - Case studies demonstrating successful VSM implementation
  - Tools and software for Value Stream Mapping
  - Integration of VSM with other Lean practices, such as Kaizen and 5S

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to Lean principles or Value Stream Mapping, such as general project management techniques or unrelated Agile practices that do not focus on workflow visualisation and optimisation.
