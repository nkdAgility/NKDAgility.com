Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Value Stream Mapping.**  
  Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a Lean management technique used to visualise and analyse the flow of materials and information required to bring a product or service to the customer. Its primary purpose is to identify inefficiencies, eliminate waste, and optimise value delivery throughout the entire process.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Value Stream Mapping
  - Steps involved in creating a Value Stream Map
  - Identifying value-added and non-value-added activities
  - Techniques for analysing and improving workflows
  - The role of VSM in Lean and Agile methodologies
  - Case studies demonstrating successful VSM implementation
  - Tools and software for Value Stream Mapping
  - Integration of VSM with other Lean practices, such as Kaizen and 5S

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to Lean principles or Value Stream Mapping, such as general project management techniques or unrelated Agile practices that do not focus on workflow visualisation and optimisation.

  subtitle: Mapping workflows to enhance efficiency and value delivery in Agile, Lean, and DevOps practices.
  content: |-
    Value Stream Mapping is all about visualising workflows to pinpoint inefficiencies and enhance the delivery of value across various methodologies like Agile, Lean, and DevOps. By mapping out the steps involved in a process, teams can better understand how work flows, where bottlenecks occur, and how to streamline operations for improved outcomes. This approach is particularly relevant in contexts such as Kanban, where visual management is key, and in Agile and Scrum, where iterative improvements are essential.

    Posts in this classification should delve into topics like identifying value streams, analysing process steps, and implementing changes to optimise flow. They can also explore connections to Lean principles, the role of Value Stream Mapping in DevOps and Continuous Delivery, and how it ties into Evidence-Based Management and Complexity Theory. By focusing on these areas, contributors can help teams leverage Value Stream Mapping to drive continuous improvement and deliver greater value to customers.
