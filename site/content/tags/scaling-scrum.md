description: Applying Scrum principles at scale to maintain agility across large organisations.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Scaling Scrum.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the application of Scrum principles and practices in large organisations, ensuring that agility is maintained while managing multiple teams and complex projects. This includes frameworks and methodologies that facilitate the scaling of Scrum beyond individual teams to the organisational level.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Frameworks for Scaling Scrum (e.g., SAFe, LeSS, Nexus)
  - Coordination and collaboration among multiple Scrum teams
  - Maintaining Scrum roles, events, and artefacts at scale
  - Challenges and solutions in scaling Scrum
  - Integration of Agile practices with organisational structures
  - Metrics and performance indicators for scaled Scrum implementations
  - Case studies and real-world examples of successful scaling
  - Leadership and cultural considerations in scaling Scrum

  **Strictly exclude** discussions on unrelated Agile methodologies, non-Scrum frameworks, or misinterpretations of Scrum principles that do not pertain to scaling practices.
