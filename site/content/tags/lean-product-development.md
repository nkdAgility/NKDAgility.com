description: Minimising waste while maximising learning in product creation.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Lean Product Development.**  
  The scope of Lean Product Development focuses on minimising waste while maximising learning throughout the product creation process. This approach emphasises efficiency, continuous improvement, and delivering value to customers by optimising resources and processes.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - Principles of Lean Thinking and its application in product development.
  - Techniques for identifying and eliminating waste in the product lifecycle.
  - The role of customer feedback in driving product iterations and improvements.
  - Strategies for fostering a culture of continuous learning and experimentation.
  - Integration of Lean principles with Agile methodologies to enhance product delivery.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful Lean Product Development practices.
  - Tools and frameworks that support Lean Product Development, such as Value Stream Mapping and A3 Problem Solving.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that deviate from Lean principles, such as overly prescriptive methodologies that do not allow for flexibility, or topics that focus solely on traditional project management without considering Lean's emphasis on value and waste reduction.
