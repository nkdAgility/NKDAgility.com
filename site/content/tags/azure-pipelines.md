  **Use this category only for discussions on Azure Pipelines.**  
  The Azure Pipelines category focuses on the automation of software development processes, specifically builds, tests, and deployments using Azure DevOps services. This category encompasses the principles and practices that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) within the Azure ecosystem.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Overview of Azure Pipelines and its role in DevOps.
  - Configuration and management of build and release pipelines.
  - Integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
  - Implementation of CI/CD practices using Azure Pipelines.
  - Use of YAML for pipeline definitions and configurations.
  - Strategies for testing and quality assurance within pipelines.
  - Deployment strategies, including blue-green and canary deployments.
  - Monitoring and logging of pipeline executions and outcomes.
  - Best practices for optimising pipeline performance and reliability.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that do not directly relate to Azure Pipelines, such as general DevOps principles without specific reference to Azure, unrelated cloud services, or non-technical topics. Misinterpretations of Azure Pipelines, such as discussions solely focused on Azure infrastructure without mentioning pipelines, should also be excluded.

    This classification focuses on the use of Azure Pipelines to automate the software development lifecycle, making it a vital tool for teams embracing Agile, DevOps, and Lean methodologies. Posts in this category should explore how Azure Pipelines can enhance continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently. 

    Key topics include setting up and configuring pipelines, integrating testing and deployment processes, and leveraging Azure's capabilities to support Agile practices like Kanban and Scrum. Additionally, discussions may touch on how Azure Pipelines aligns with principles from Lean and Evidence-Based Management, helping teams to optimise workflows and make informed decisions based on real-time data.
