In Kanban, the Definition of Workflow (DoW) is not a static checklist. It is a dynamic model of how work flows through a value stream, and how progress is made visible. The Kanban Guide defines it as the **explicit agreements and policies** that guide how work is selected, started, progressed, and completed.

It includes:

- **Entry criteria**: What makes work ready to enter the system.
- **WIP limits**: How much can be in progress at once.
- **Exit policies**: What constitutes ‘done’ for each state.

> It’s how you define “what we mean when we say we’re doing the work.”

This isn't about micromanagement. It's about making the system **legible**, so we can improve it. Kanban treats workflow as something we inspect and evolve. Not define once and forget.

## The implications of a Definition of Workflow in Scrum

Scrum doesn’t explicitly define a “Definition of Workflow,” but it does have a **Definition of Done (DoD)** and expects teams to visualise their work.
