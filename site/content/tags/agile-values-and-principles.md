title: Agile Values and Principles
description: Understand and apply Agile Values and Principles based on first principles. Build a foundation for true agility and continuous value delivery
Instructions: Use this category only for discussions on Agile Values and Principles, focusing on first principles thinking rather than specific frameworks. Topics should explore the core values of the Agile Manifesto, empirical process control, adaptability, collaboration, and delivering working software. Discussions should emphasise why Agile works at its core, rather than just how it is implemented.
