title: Customer Focus
ResourceId: p1bdjnIJDmW
description: Deliver what matters. Shape systems and decisions around customer outcomes, not internal convenience.
abstract: Customer Focus is not a platitude. It's the first principle of agile delivery and product development. It defines value, directs investment, and constrains decisions. If you're not anchored in real customer outcomes, you're optimising the wrong system. This principle demands more than empathy. It demands feedback, evidence, and relentless alignment to customer need.

Customer Focus is the lens through which all meaningful delivery is measured. It's not about opinions. It's about outcomes. If your product doesn't change customer behaviour, it doesn’t matter how elegant the code is or how smooth the deployment was.

Customer Focus drives:

- Product strategy grounded in real user need
- Feedback loops that start and end in production
- Backlog prioritisation that reflects outcome over effort
- Decision-making based on evidence, not assumption

If you’re optimising team velocity, delivery cadence, or engineering throughput without validating customer value, you're reinforcing the wrong system.

### Signs of Customer Focus in Practice

- Features are prioritised based on validated user need
- Sprint Goals are framed in terms of impact, not tasks
- Telemetry is used to measure outcomes, not just uptime
- Feedback from production informs backlog decisions
- Stakeholder reviews include customer insights, not just demos

### What to Expect

Expect clarity. Expect discipline. Expect work that doesn’t just move fast, but moves in the right direction.

Customer Focus demands that every system of work stays anchored in the only metric that matters: did we deliver something valuable to our customer?
