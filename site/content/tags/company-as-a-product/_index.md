description: Company as a Product (CaaP) is an organisational strategy that treats the entire company as a continuously evolving product, rather than a static structure. It emphasises designing and refining the organisation based on customer feedback, measurable outcomes, and strategic goals—much like product development. Popularised by thought leaders in modern organisational design and continuous discovery, CaaP encourages cross-functional collaboration, experimentation, and alignment across all levels. Instead of optimising for internal efficiency or hierarchy, it focuses on delivering value to customers and adapting the company’s capabilities, systems, and structures as intentionally as one would iterate on a product.
