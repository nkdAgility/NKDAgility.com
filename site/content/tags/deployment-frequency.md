Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Deployment Frequency.**  
  The category of Deployment Frequency focuses on the optimisation of software deployment intervals to improve feedback loops and enhance value delivery within Agile and DevOps practices. It emphasises the importance of frequent, reliable releases to facilitate rapid iterations, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The significance of deployment frequency in Agile and DevOps methodologies.
  - Strategies for increasing deployment frequency, including automation and CI/CD practices.
  - The relationship between deployment frequency and feedback loops in product development.
  - Metrics and measurement techniques for assessing deployment frequency.
  - Case studies or examples illustrating successful deployment frequency improvements.
  - Challenges and best practices in achieving higher deployment frequency.
  - The impact of deployment frequency on team dynamics and collaboration.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the optimisation of deployment intervals, such as general software development practices unrelated to Agile or DevOps, or topics that misinterpret the core principles of continuous delivery and deployment.
