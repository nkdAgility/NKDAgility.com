Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Evidence-Based Management.**  
  The scope of Evidence-Based Management (EBM) encompasses the application of empirical evidence to enhance organisational agility and improve decision-making processes. This category aims to provide insights into how data-driven approaches can inform management practices and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - The principles and practices of Evidence-Based Management as outlined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
  - Techniques for measuring and evaluating organisational performance using empirical data.
  - The role of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in guiding decision-making.
  - Case studies demonstrating the successful application of EBM in various organisational contexts.
  - The integration of EBM with Agile methodologies to enhance responsiveness and adaptability.
  - Strategies for fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making within teams and organisations.
  - The impact of EBM on stakeholder engagement and collaboration.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of Evidence-Based Management, such as anecdotal evidence, unverified claims, or practices that do not rely on empirical data. Misinterpretations of EBM that suggest a purely subjective or opinion-based approach to management should also be avoided.
