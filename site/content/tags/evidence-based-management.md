Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Evidence-Based Management.**  
  The scope of Evidence-Based Management (EBM) encompasses the application of empirical evidence to enhance organisational agility and improve decision-making processes. This category aims to provide insights into how data-driven approaches can inform management practices and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - The principles and practices of Evidence-Based Management as outlined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
  - Techniques for measuring and evaluating organisational performance using empirical data.
  - The role of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in guiding decision-making.
  - Case studies demonstrating the successful application of EBM in various organisational contexts.
  - The integration of EBM with Agile methodologies to enhance responsiveness and adaptability.
  - Strategies for fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making within teams and organisations.
  - The impact of EBM on stakeholder engagement and collaboration.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of Evidence-Based Management, such as anecdotal evidence, unverified claims, or practices that do not rely on empirical data. Misinterpretations of EBM that suggest a purely subjective or opinion-based approach to management should also be avoided.

    This classification focuses on the use of empirical evidence to enhance decision-making and boost agility within organisations. It encourages teams to leverage data and insights from their own experiences, rather than relying solely on theoretical models or assumptions. By grounding practices in real-world evidence, organisations can adapt more effectively to change and improve their overall performance.

    Posts in this category should explore key topics such as the principles of Evidence-Based Management, the integration of data-driven decision-making in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps practices, and the application of complexity theory in navigating organisational challenges. Additionally, discussions may include insights from influential figures in the field, such as Ken Schwaber and Gene Kim, as well as methodologies like Kanban and Lean, to illustrate how evidence can inform and optimise workflows.
