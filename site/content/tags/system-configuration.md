Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on System Configuration.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the processes and methodologies involved in setting up and configuring software, hardware, and systems to achieve optimal performance and reliability. This includes the principles and practices that ensure systems are tailored to meet specific operational needs and can adapt to changing requirements.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - Best practices for software installation and configuration.
  - Hardware setup and integration for system performance.
  - Configuration management tools and techniques.
  - System optimisation strategies for performance enhancement.
  - Monitoring and maintaining system configurations.
  - Troubleshooting common configuration issues.
  - The role of automation in system configuration.
  - Security considerations in system setup and configuration.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the technical aspects of system configuration, such as general software development practices, project management methodologies unrelated to configuration, or theoretical discussions that do not directly pertain to the practicalities of configuring systems.
