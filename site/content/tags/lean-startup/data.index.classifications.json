Depth of Discussion (4.6): The article discusses the Lean Startup method in reasonable detail, especially around MVPs, experimentation, and culture.

Direct mentions of 'Acceptance Test Driven Development' (ATDD) do not exist—ATDD, its principles, and its unique collaborative software development context are absent. The 'mentions' score is extremely low (0.2) since ATDD is not named or referenced in any way, nor are its practices. In 'alignment', there is a minimal overlap in that both discuss learning and collaboration, but the overlap is generic and does not extend to testable acceptance criteria, stakeholder-developer-tester relations, or ATDD frameworks, so the score is low (0.5). The 'depth' of discussion on ATDD topics is almost nonexistent (0.4); the content never delves beyond general notions of collaborative development or testing, and acceptance testing itself is not discussed. 'Intent' scores 0.5: while the article is informative and professionally written, it is not meant to educate or inform about ATDD, but rather focuses wholly on Lean Startup principles. 'Audience' rates higher (3.2), as there could be some overlap—both ATDD and Lean Startup can attract product managers, startup founders, or process-improvement-focused technical leads—but ATDD's technical/development focus is not reflected here. The 'signal' score (2.0) reflects that while the whole document is relevant to Lean Startup, nearly none of it is relevant to ATDD, making the signal for this category quite weak. No penalties for outdatedness or a contradictory tone were warranted, as the content is current, neutral, and professional.

Alignment: Concepts of diagnosing product-market fit and experimenting with MVPs could be loosely analogized to troubleshooting, but the central themes are about business validation, not technical problem-solving or defect resolution. The difference between Lean Startup and troubleshooting is maintained clearly, so the alignment remains weak (1.8).\n\n3. Depth: The discussion focuses in depth on Lean principles, experimentation, MVPs, and long-term business strategy, with almost no coverage of actual troubleshooting practices or diagnostic methodology. Score is slightly higher than alignment as feedback and error-correction are present but not in the required technical sense (1.6).\n\n4.

The main ideas strongly align with the category; MVPs, experiments, feedback loops, and data-driven pivots are central to both Lean Startup and Hypothesis Driven Development (alignment: 9.5). Depth is good—the article details how teams use experiments and feedback, draws distinctions from Agile, and discusses cultural and organizational impacts—though it could offer more specific examples of hypothesis formulation and testing mechanics (depth: 8.6). The purpose of the piece is teaching and advocacy for hypothesis-based learning, so intent fits well (intent: 8.7). The audience is practitioners and strategists in product, business, and startup contexts—matching the category’s intended audience (audience: 8.2). The proportion of relevant content is high; there is little filler or tangential matter (signal: 8.1).
