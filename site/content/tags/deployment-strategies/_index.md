description: Balancing risk and speed when getting software into production.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Deployment Strategies.**  
  This category focuses on the methodologies and practices involved in effectively deploying software into production while managing the associated risks and optimising for speed. It encompasses various strategies that aim to ensure smooth transitions from development to live environments, facilitating continuous delivery and integration.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - Blue-Green Deployments: Techniques for reducing downtime and risk by maintaining two identical production environments.
  - Canary Releases: Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before a full-scale deployment to monitor performance and impact.
  - Feature Toggles: Implementing features in a way that allows them to be turned on or off without deploying new code.
  - Rolling Updates: Incrementally updating instances of an application to ensure availability and reduce the risk of failure.
  - Infrastructure as Code: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, enhancing deployment consistency.
  - Continuous Deployment: Automating the release process to ensure that every change that passes automated tests is deployed to production.
  - Risk Management in Deployments: Strategies for assessing and mitigating risks associated with software releases.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the methodologies of deploying software, such as general software development practices, project management techniques unrelated to deployment, or theoretical discussions that do not provide actionable insights into deployment strategies.
