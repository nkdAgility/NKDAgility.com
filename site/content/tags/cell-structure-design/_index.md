description: Cell Structure Design is an organisational design model developed by Niels Pfl√§ging, rooted in the principles of the Beta Codex. It replaces traditional hierarchies with a decentralised, network-based structure composed of autonomous, value-creating units called **cells**. Each cell operates with end-to-end responsibility, enabling responsiveness, accountability, and continuous adaptation. Informed by complexity theory, Cell Structure Design rejects command-and-control in favour of dynamic coordination and transparency, empowering people to self-organise around customer value rather than roles or silos.
