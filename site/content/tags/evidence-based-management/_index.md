title: Evidence Based Management
description: Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a strategy for improving an organisation’s ability to deliver value by making decisions based on evidence, not opinion. It enables data-informed investment in agility, innovation, and outcomes rather than output.

abstract: 'Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a strategic approach designed to enhance organisational agility by providing a framework for assessing and improving value delivery. Unlike traditional frameworks or methodologies, EBM focuses on empirical data to inform decision-making, enabling organisations to move beyond superficial metrics and truly understand their performance. It centres on four critical areas: Current Value, which evaluates immediate value delivery; Time to Market, which measures responsiveness and speed; Ability to Innovate, which assesses the capacity for creating new value amidst existing challenges; and Unrealised Value, which identifies potential opportunities for growth. By utilising these metrics, leaders can make informed decisions about resource allocation and prioritisation, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous improvement. EBM is particularly valuable in the contexts of agile, DevOps, and product development, as it encourages a shift from output-focused practices to outcome-driven strategies. This empirical approach not only clarifies organisational goals but also provides the necessary feedback to adapt and evolve, ensuring that efforts are aligned with delivering real value rather than merely maintaining the status quo. In a landscape where many organisations struggle with agility, EBM offers a practical solution for those seeking to enhance their effectiveness and responsiveness in a complex and dynamic environment.'

  **Use this category only for discussions on Evidence-Based Management.**  
  Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a strategic approach aimed at enhancing an organisation's capacity to deliver value by relying on empirical evidence rather than subjective opinions. It focuses on data-informed decision-making to foster agility, innovation, and improved outcomes, steering clear of mere output metrics.

  **Key Topics:**
  1. **Current Value** – Metrics that assess present value delivery, including customer satisfaction, revenue per employee, and product usage.
  2. **Time to Market** – Indicators of responsiveness and speed, such as cycle time, release frequency, and time spent on stabilising releases.
  3. **Ability to Innovate** – Evaluation of innovation capacity through metrics like innovation rate, feature usage, and actual product utilisation.
  4. **Unrealised Value** – Analysis of opportunity costs and potential gains from reducing constraints and enhancing capabilities.
  5. **Empirical Decision-Making** – The importance of using data to inform strategic improvements and prioritise investments.
  6. **Outcome Management** – Transitioning from output-focused metrics to managing for meaningful outcomes and value delivery.

  **Strictly Excluded Topics:**
  - General discussions on Agile or Scrum methodologies without a focus on evidence-based practices.
  - Theoretical or abstract concepts that do not relate directly to the application of data in management decisions.
  - Any content that promotes frameworks or tools without grounding in empirical evidence or metrics.

Too many organisations talk about being agile, but they’re still flying blind. Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a strategy to fix that. It’s not a framework, a methodology, or a tool. It’s a way to stop pretending we’re improving and start proving it.

EBM gives us a structure for inspecting how well we're delivering value and where to invest next. It’s built around four key areas:

1. **Current Value** – Are we delivering value now, or are we just burning cash? Customer satisfaction, revenue per employee, and product usage give us the truth.
2. **Time to Market** – How fast can we learn, deliver, and respond to change? Cycle time, release frequency, and time spent stabilising releases tell us whether we’re built for speed or for bureaucracy.
3. **Ability to Innovate** – Can we create new value, or are we buried under technical debt and bloated backlogs? Look at innovation rate, feature usage, and how much of the product is actually used.
4. **Unrealised Value** – What’s the opportunity cost of staying the same? If we had fewer constraints, where could we win?

These aren’t vanity metrics. They’re signals that help leaders make real decisions about where to focus, where to invest, and what to stop doing. You don’t need a prescription. You need clarity, direction, and feedback.

EBM enables an empirical approach to strategic improvement. It’s not about tracking everything. It’s about measuring the right things, at the right time, to drive better outcomes. If you're not using data to improve how you deliver value, then you're not doing agility. You're doing theatre.

If you want to move beyond output metrics and start managing for outcomes, EBM gives you the scaffolding to do that—without pretending there’s a silver bullet. It’s messy. It’s iterative. But it works.
