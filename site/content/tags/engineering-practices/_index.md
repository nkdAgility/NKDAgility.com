Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Engineering Practices.**  
  This category encompasses the fundamental principles and methodologies that underpin Agile development, focusing on the importance of clean code, automation, and test-first development. It aims to promote high-quality software engineering practices that enhance collaboration, efficiency, and adaptability within Agile teams.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Clean Code: Principles and practices for writing maintainable and readable code, as advocated by Robert C. Martin and Martin Fowler.
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD): The practice of writing tests before code to ensure functionality and facilitate refactoring, as outlined in the works of Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries.
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Strategies for automating the integration and delivery of code changes, as discussed by Jez Humble and Gene Kim.
  - Refactoring: Techniques for improving the structure of existing code without changing its external behaviour, as highlighted by Martin Fowler.
  - Automation: The use of tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks in the development process, enhancing efficiency and reducing human error.
  - Pair Programming: A collaborative approach to coding where two developers work together at one workstation, promoting knowledge sharing and code quality.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that deviate from the core principles of Agile engineering practices, such as project management methodologies unrelated to software development, non-technical topics, or personal opinions that do not align with established Agile philosophies.
