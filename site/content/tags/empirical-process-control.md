description: Adapting based on evidence, not assumptions, through inspection and transparency.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Empirical Process Control.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses the principles and practices that emphasise decision-making based on observed evidence rather than assumptions. It is rooted in the Agile philosophy and is essential for fostering transparency, inspection, and adaptation within teams and organisations.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The role of transparency in Agile methodologies and its impact on team dynamics.
  - Techniques for effective inspection and how they contribute to continuous improvement.
  - The importance of adaptation in response to feedback and changing circumstances.
  - Case studies illustrating successful implementation of empirical process control in Agile and Scrum environments.
  - The relationship between empirical process control and other Agile frameworks, such as Kanban and Lean.
  - Tools and practices that facilitate empirical process control, including metrics and feedback loops.
  - Theoretical foundations from key figures such as Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Patricia Kong.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that focus on prescriptive or deterministic approaches to project management.
  - Content that misinterprets empirical process control as merely following processes without the need for evidence-based adjustments.
  - Topics unrelated to Agile, Scrum, or the principles of empirical process control, such as unrelated business strategies or non-Agile methodologies.
