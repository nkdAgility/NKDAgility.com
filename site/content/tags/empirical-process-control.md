description: Adapting based on evidence, not assumptions, through inspection and transparency.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Empirical Process Control.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses the principles and practices that emphasise decision-making based on observed evidence rather than assumptions. It is rooted in the Agile philosophy and is essential for fostering transparency, inspection, and adaptation within teams and organisations.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The role of transparency in Agile methodologies and its impact on team dynamics.
  - Techniques for effective inspection and how they contribute to continuous improvement.
  - The importance of adaptation in response to feedback and changing circumstances.
  - Case studies illustrating successful implementation of empirical process control in Agile and Scrum environments.
  - The relationship between empirical process control and other Agile frameworks, such as Kanban and Lean.
  - Tools and practices that facilitate empirical process control, including metrics and feedback loops.
  - Theoretical foundations from key figures such as Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, and Patricia Kong.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that focus on prescriptive or deterministic approaches to project management.
  - Content that misinterprets empirical process control as merely following processes without the need for evidence-based adjustments.
  - Topics unrelated to Agile, Scrum, or the principles of empirical process control, such as unrelated business strategies or non-Agile methodologies.

  title: Empirical Process Control
  subtitle: Harnessing evidence-driven insights for adaptive decision-making in Agile, Lean, and DevOps practices.
  content: |-
    This classification focuses on the principles of adapting and evolving practices based on real evidence rather than assumptions. It emphasises the importance of transparency and regular inspection in processes, allowing teams to make informed decisions that enhance their workflows. By leveraging insights from various methodologies like Agile, Lean, and DevOps, this approach encourages continuous improvement and responsiveness to change.

    Posts in this classification should explore key topics such as the role of empirical data in decision-making, the significance of feedback loops, and the application of frameworks like Kanban and Scrum. Additionally, discussions around Evidence-Based Management and its connection to complexity theory can provide valuable perspectives on navigating uncertainty and fostering a culture of learning within teams.
