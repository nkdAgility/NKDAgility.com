  **Use this category only for discussions on Release Management.**  
  Release Management encompasses the strategies and practices involved in planning, scheduling, and controlling the process of software releases. Its purpose is to ensure that software is delivered in a reliable, efficient, and timely manner, aligning with business goals and user needs.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Incremental and iterative release planning
  - Version control and release scheduling
  - Coordination between development, operations, and stakeholders
  - Risk management in release processes
  - Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices
  - Feedback loops and user acceptance testing
  - Tools and frameworks for effective release management
  - Metrics and performance indicators for release success

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile or Scrum without a focus on release processes
  - Non-technical content unrelated to software delivery
  - Misinterpretations of release management as solely project management or change management without the context of software releases.
