description: Applying software engineering principles to ensure scalable and reliable systems.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Site Reliability Engineering.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the application of software engineering principles to enhance the reliability, scalability, and performance of systems in production environments. It focuses on the integration of development and operations to create resilient systems that can withstand failures and maintain service quality.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category:**
  - Principles of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) as defined by Google.
  - The role of SRE in bridging the gap between development and operations.
  - Best practices for monitoring, incident response, and post-mortem analysis.
  - The use of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
  - Automation and tooling to improve system reliability and reduce manual intervention.
  - Capacity planning and performance optimisation strategies.
  - The impact of culture and collaboration on reliability engineering.
  - Case studies and real-world applications of SRE principles.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that do not directly relate to the principles and practices of Site Reliability Engineering, such as general software development practices, unrelated DevOps topics, or Agile methodologies that do not specifically address reliability in production systems.
