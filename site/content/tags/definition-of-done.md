description: Ensure transparency and quality with the Definition of Done (DoD). Align teams on what it means for work to be truly complete.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Definition of Done.**  
  The Definition of Done (DoD) is a critical Agile and Scrum concept that ensures transparency and quality in the delivery of work. It serves as a shared understanding among team members regarding the criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered complete. The DoD helps to align teams on expectations and promotes accountability, ultimately leading to higher quality outcomes.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The purpose and importance of the Definition of Done in Agile and Scrum frameworks.
  - Criteria that typically comprise a Definition of Done, such as code review, testing, documentation, and acceptance criteria.
  - The role of the Definition of Done in enhancing team collaboration and communication.
  - How the Definition of Done contributes to maintaining product quality and reducing technical debt.
  - Best practices for creating, maintaining, and evolving the Definition of Done within teams.
  - The relationship between the Definition of Done and other Agile artefacts, such as the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.
  - Examples of effective Definitions of Done from various Agile teams and projects.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of the Definition of Done, such as unrelated project management practices, non-Agile methodologies, or personal opinions on team dynamics that do not directly relate to the DoD.
