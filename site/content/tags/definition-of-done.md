description: Ensure transparency and quality with the Definition of Done (DoD). Align teams on what it means for work to be truly complete.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Definition of Done.**  
  The Definition of Done (DoD) is a critical Agile and Scrum concept that ensures transparency and quality in the delivery of work. It serves as a shared understanding among team members regarding the criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered complete. The DoD helps to align teams on expectations and promotes accountability, ultimately leading to higher quality outcomes.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The purpose and importance of the Definition of Done in Agile and Scrum frameworks.
  - Criteria that typically comprise a Definition of Done, such as code review, testing, documentation, and acceptance criteria.
  - The role of the Definition of Done in enhancing team collaboration and communication.
  - How the Definition of Done contributes to maintaining product quality and reducing technical debt.
  - Best practices for creating, maintaining, and evolving the Definition of Done within teams.
  - The relationship between the Definition of Done and other Agile artefacts, such as the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.
  - Examples of effective Definitions of Done from various Agile teams and projects.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of the Definition of Done, such as unrelated project management practices, non-Agile methodologies, or personal opinions on team dynamics that do not directly relate to the DoD.

    The Definition of Done (DoD) is all about setting clear expectations for when work is considered complete. It helps teams maintain transparency and ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding quality standards. By defining what "done" means, teams can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that all necessary criteria are met before a task is marked as finished.

    In this classification, posts should explore key topics such as the creation and implementation of DoD in Agile and Scrum environments, its role in DevOps and Continuous Delivery, and how it aligns with Lean principles. Additionally, discussions can include the impact of DoD on team dynamics, evidence-based management, and its relevance in managing complexity within projects.
