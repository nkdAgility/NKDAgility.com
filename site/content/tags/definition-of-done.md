title: Definition of Done
description: Ensure transparency and quality with the Definition of Done (DoD). Align teams on what it means for work to be truly complete.
Instructions: Use this category only for discussions on Definition of Done (DoD), defined as creating transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration. Topics should focus on establishing, enforcing, and evolving the Definition of Done to ensure high-quality, releasable increments.
