The 'Intent' and 'Audience' are geared toward practitioners interested in software quality and automation, not decision theory. Slightly higher 'Audience' and 'Signal' scores reflect that the material is focused and professional, but this does not bridge the conceptual gap. No penalty is applied as the content is current, neutral in tone, and not satirical.
