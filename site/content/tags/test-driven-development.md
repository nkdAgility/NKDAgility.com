description: Driving software design through automated tests for better quality.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Test Driven Development.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the principles and practices of Test Driven Development (TDD), a software development approach that emphasises writing automated tests before writing the corresponding code. This methodology aims to improve code quality, facilitate design decisions, and ensure that the software meets its requirements from the outset.

  **Key topics to be discussed under this category include:**
  - The TDD cycle: Red-Green-Refactor
  - Writing unit tests before code implementation
  - The role of automated testing in software design
  - Benefits of TDD for code quality and maintainability
  - Common TDD practices and patterns
  - Integration of TDD with Agile methodologies
  - Challenges and misconceptions surrounding TDD
  - Tools and frameworks that support TDD (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Mocha)

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of TDD, such as general software development practices that do not specifically address the TDD methodology, or unrelated testing strategies that do not involve the TDD cycle.

  subtitle: Enhancing software quality through automated testing to inform design decisions and foster continuous improvement.
  content: Automated testing shapes software design by ensuring code quality and facilitating iterative improvements. Posts should explore the integration of tests in the development process, the impact on design decisions, and the role of feedback loops in enhancing product reliability and responsiveness to change.
