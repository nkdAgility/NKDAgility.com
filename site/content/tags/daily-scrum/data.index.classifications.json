There are no direct mentions of 'organisational change,' nor explicit discussion of frameworks, leadership roles, or organisation-wide transformation methods outlined in the definition. Depth of discussion is moderate because it explores advantages of the Daily Scrum beyond the basics (such as impact on team dynamics), but does not expand its relevance to large-scale change management, agile transformation at the organisational level, or supporting structures. The intent is somewhat aligned since it positions the Daily Scrum as enabler of agile values, yet the core purpose is instructional about a single ceremony rather than about organisational change processes. The target audience is practitioners—Scrum teams and agile practitioners—which partially overlaps with, but does not completely match, the typically more strategic 'organisational change' audience. The signal-to-noise ratio is good; content is focused, but its relevance to the category is more indirect.

There is some conceptual tangential alignment, as practices that foster transparency and regular communication could indirectly contribute to psychological safety. However, there is no discussion of risk-taking, leader behaviors, or the avoidance of fear of negative consequences, which are central to the psychological safety category. The depth of discussion revolves around the process and impact on alignment and collaboration, not on psychological safety per se. The audience is agile practitioners and Scrum teams, which matches the likely audience for psychological safety topics, justifying a higher score there. The content is focused and relevant for its topic but is only tangential to the category's strict criteria, reducing the signal score.

The depth of discussion is limited to best practices and benefits of the Daily Scrum, with no exploration of forecasting-specific tools, metrics, or empirical approaches (such as burn-down charts, cumulative flow diagrams, or historical trend analysis). The intent is tangentially supportive in that regular communication and focus on goals can help create better data for future forecasting, but this is not discussed or implied as a major theme.
