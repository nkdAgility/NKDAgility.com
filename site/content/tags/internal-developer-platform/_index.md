Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Internal Developer Platform.**  
  The Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a framework that enhances the efficiency of software development by providing a controlled environment where development, testing, and deployment processes are streamlined. It aims to empower development teams by automating repetitive tasks, improving collaboration, and ensuring consistency across the software delivery lifecycle.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and purpose of Internal Developer Platforms
  - Benefits of using an IDP in software development
  - Key components and architecture of an IDP
  - Best practices for implementing an Internal Developer Platform
  - Role of IDPs in DevOps and Continuous Delivery
  - Case studies and real-world applications of IDPs
  - Comparison of IDPs with traditional development environments
  - Tools and technologies commonly used in IDPs

  **Strictly exclude** discussions on unrelated topics such as general Agile methodologies, Scrum practices, or specific programming languages that do not pertain to the concept of Internal Developer Platforms. Misinterpretations of IDPs as merely a collection of tools without the context of streamlining development processes should also be avoided.
