description: Enhance forecasting in Agile and Scrum. Use empirical data to predict delivery timelines, manage risk, and optimise value delivery.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Forecasting.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore methods and practices that enhance forecasting within Agile and Scrum frameworks. It focuses on the utilisation of empirical data to predict delivery timelines, manage risks, and optimise value delivery, ensuring that teams can make informed decisions based on historical performance and current trends.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Techniques for effective forecasting in Agile and Scrum environments.
  - The role of empirical data in predicting delivery timelines.
  - Methods for managing risk through accurate forecasting.
  - Strategies for optimising value delivery based on forecasted outcomes.
  - The impact of team velocity and historical data on future planning.
  - Utilisation of metrics such as burn-down charts and cumulative flow diagrams for forecasting.
  - Best practices for incorporating stakeholder feedback into forecasting processes.
  - The relationship between forecasting and continuous improvement in Agile practices.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that do not directly relate to the methodologies and practices of forecasting within Agile and Scrum, such as unrelated project management techniques, non-empirical approaches, or general business strategies that do not focus on Agile principles.
