title: One Engineering System
abstract: The One Engineering System (1ES) is a strategic framework designed to unify engineering tools and practices across various teams, aiming to reduce friction, enhance collaboration, and ensure consistency at scale. Originating from the need to streamline workflows in software development, 1ES focuses on establishing a shared engineering backbone that allows teams to operate more efficiently by eliminating the chaos associated with disparate toolchains and ad hoc processes. This approach is crucial in agile and DevOps environments, as it promotes a common set of engineering standards that facilitate planning, coding, testing, deployment, and production support. By reducing cognitive overhead and simplifying integration, 1ES enables teams to deliver high-quality outcomes more reliably. Importantly, the framework emphasises that tools should adapt to the teams' workflows rather than impose rigid structures, allowing for flexibility and coherence rather than uniformity. Successful implementation of 1ES necessitates investment in team enablement, including guidance, training, and support, to ensure effective adoption. When executed properly, 1ES fosters scalable engineering excellence, characterised by clear communication, consistent processes, and a resilient development lifecycle across the organisation.

The **One Engineering System (1ES)** is a strategic approach to unifying engineering tools and practices across teams to reduce friction, foster collaboration, and enable consistency at scale. It’s about creating a shared engineering backbone that allows teams to move faster and more predictably by removing the chaos of disconnected toolchains and ad hoc workflows.

At its core, 1ES is not about enforcing a single toolset but about aligning teams around a **common set of engineering standards** that streamline how work gets done—from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and supporting software in production. This shared foundation reduces cognitive overhead, simplifies integration across teams, and makes it easier to deliver high-quality, reliable outcomes.

A successful 1ES strategy recognises that **tools must serve the way teams work**, not the other way around. Each team should be empowered to adapt their workflows within the shared system, leveraging the strengths of the chosen tools without being constrained by rigid implementations. It’s not about uniformity; it’s about coherence.

Implementing 1ES requires more than tooling changes—it demands **investment in enablement**. Teams need guidance, training, and support to adopt the system effectively. When done well, 1ES creates the conditions for scalable engineering excellence: clear communication, consistent processes, and a resilient development lifecycle across the organisation.
