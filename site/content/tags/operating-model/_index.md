abstract: An operating model is a conceptual framework that outlines how an organization delivers value to its customers and stakeholders by defining the key components, processes, roles, and interactions required to execute its strategy. Originating from management and organizational design disciplines, the operating model serves as a bridge between high-level business strategy and day-to-day operations, detailing how resources, technology, governance, and workflows are structured to achieve desired outcomes. A well-defined operating model is crucial because it enables organizations to align their structure and practices with strategic goals, foster cross-functional collaboration, and respond effectively to changing market demands. By clarifying responsibilities, decision-making authority, and the flow of information, the operating model supports scalability and the integration of new ways of working. This clarity is especially valuable in complex environments where efficient delivery and coordination are essential for maintaining competitiveness and achieving sustainable growth. Organizations may implement various specialized operating models depending on their value delivery approach, delivery philosophy, and product characteristics.

  Use this category only for discussions on Operating Model.

  **Scope and Intent:**  
  This category is strictly for content that explores the design, implementation, adaptation, or evaluation of operating models within organizations. The intent is to capture discussions that address how organizations structure their people, processes, technology, governance, and workflows to deliver value in alignment with strategic objectives. Content should reflect the operating model as a bridge between business strategy and execution—the fundamental "way we work" across the organization. This is the broadest classification that includes specialized operating models such as Product Operating Model, Agile Product Operating Model, and AI Product Operating Model, which may adopt different delivery philosophies and practices. Theoretical alignment should reference foundational management and organizational design principles from recognized authorities in organizational effectiveness and systems thinking.

  **Key Topics Relevant to This Category:**
  - Definition and components of operating models (e.g., value streams, roles, governance, workflows, technology enablers)
  - Specialized operating models including Product Operating Model, Agile Product Operating Model, and AI Product Operating Model
  - Operating model design and transformation across organizations
  - Alignment of operating models with business strategy and value delivery
  - Integration of cross-functional teams, end-to-end value delivery, and flow optimization
  - Governance structures, decision rights, and accountability frameworks
  - Organizational structure and "the way we work" across departments and teams
  - Case studies or examples of operating model changes and transformations
  - Measurement and evaluation of operating model effectiveness
  - Theoretical underpinnings from recognized authorities in organizational design and systems thinking

  **Explicit Exclusions:**  
  Do not use this category for:
  - General discussions of specific methodologies, frameworks, or practices (e.g., Agile, Scrum, DevOps, Lean, Waterfall) that do not address organizational structure, operating model design, or transformation.
  - Technical implementation details (e.g., tool configurations, pipelines) unless directly tied to operating model implications.
  - Team-level process improvements that do not impact or reflect broader operating model considerations.
  - High-level business strategy or vision statements without discussion of operationalization.
  - Superficial mentions of "operating model" without substantive analysis or application to organizational design, structure, or value delivery.
  - Content focused solely on project management, software development methodologies, or IT service management unless explicitly connected to operating model transformation or evaluation.

  **Summary:**  
  Classify content here only if it provides substantive insight into how organizations structure and evolve their operating models—their fundamental "way we work"—to enable effective and value-driven delivery, in line with foundational theories and recognized authorities in organizational design. Exclude content that is unrelated, superficial, or limited to team-level or technical practices without broader organizational relevance.

An operating model defines the essential structure and mechanisms by which an organization consistently delivers value, translating strategy into actionable workflows, roles, and decision rights. It represents the fundamental "way we work" across the organization—the enduring backbone that shapes how teams, technology, governance, and processes interact to achieve outcomes at scale. Unlike specific frameworks, methodologies, or practices, the operating model transcends any particular approach to define how the organization functions as a whole.

## Understanding Operating Models

At its core, an operating model clarifies how work flows from idea to customer, how responsibilities are distributed, and how coordination happens across the organization. This systemic clarity enables teams to deliver predictably and adapt to change without constant reorganization or ad hoc fixes. A robust operating model supports sustainable delivery by making dependencies, handoffs, and value streams explicit, reducing friction and enabling effective execution.

It is not a set of tools or a collection of best practices, but the connective tissue that ensures alignment between strategic intent and execution, regardless of the specific delivery approach or technology stack. By establishing clear interfaces and accountabilities, the operating model empowers teams to work within defined boundaries, accelerates decision-making, and provides the foundation for scaling and resilience across the organization.

## Specialized Operating Models

Organizations often need to specialize their operating models based on how they deliver value and their chosen delivery philosophy:

- **[Product Operating Model]({{< ref "/tags/product-operating-model" >}})**: For organizations whose primary value delivery is through products, defining how teams structure work, decisions, and learning to maximize product outcomes. Can be implemented with various delivery approaches.

- **[Agile Product Operating Model]({{< ref "/tags/agile-product-operating-model" >}})**: A product operating model that specifically adopts agile methodologies, emphasizing iterative delivery, customer feedback, and continuous value creation.

- **[AI Product Operating Model]({{< ref "/tags/ai-product-operating-model" >}})**: Designed for organizations delivering value through AI-powered products, addressing unique concerns such as data governance, model lifecycle management, ethical considerations, and experimentation. Can be implemented with or without agile approaches.

## The Value of a Well-Designed Operating Model

When thoughtfully designed, an operating model enables organizations to integrate new capabilities, technologies, and ways of working without disrupting the core value delivery system. It ensures that adaptability and operational excellence are not at odds but mutually reinforcing. The operating model provides stability during change, clarity during complexity, and a foundation for sustainable growth and effectiveness across the entire organization. It is the answer to "how we work" that persists even as specific practices, tools, and technologies evolve.
