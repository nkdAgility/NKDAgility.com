  **Use this category only for discussions on Cycle Time.**  
  Cycle Time refers to the measurement of the total time taken to complete a unit of work, from the moment it is initiated until it is finished. This metric is crucial for understanding workflow efficiency and identifying areas for improvement within Agile and DevOps practices.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and importance of Cycle Time in Agile and DevOps environments.
  - Methods for measuring Cycle Time effectively.
  - The impact of Cycle Time on team performance and delivery speed.
  - Strategies for reducing Cycle Time to enhance productivity.
  - Relationship between Cycle Time and other metrics such as Lead Time and Throughput.
  - Tools and techniques for visualising Cycle Time, including Kanban boards and flow diagrams.
  - Case studies or examples demonstrating the application of Cycle Time analysis in real-world scenarios.
