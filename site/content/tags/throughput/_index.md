title: Throughput
abstract: Throughput is a critical observability metric that quantifies the volume of work completed by a system within a defined timeframe, serving as an indicator of the flow of value delivered by teams. Originating from Agile and Lean methodologies, throughput is utilised to assess system performance holistically rather than focusing on individual contributions. By monitoring throughput, teams can uncover trends, pinpoint bottlenecks, and evaluate the impact of workflow modifications on overall efficiency. Visualisation tools such as cumulative flow diagrams and flow analytics facilitate real-time tracking of throughput data, enabling teams to inspect flow health alongside other metrics like lead time and cycle time. This empirical approach fosters informed decision-making, guiding adjustments in work-in-progress limits, team structures, and planning processes. Ultimately, throughput enhances transparency and supports a culture of continuous improvement, allowing organisations to optimise their processes without relying on subjective evaluations of performance.

Instructions: |-
  **Use this tag only for discussions on Throughput as a delivery metric.**  
  Throughput measures how many work items a system completes over time. It provides observable data about team delivery capacity and helps inspect the performance of flow-based systems. This tag applies when throughput is being analysed, visualised, or interpreted to understand delivery health.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Defining and calculating throughput
  - Distinguishing throughput from effort or productivity
  - Visualising throughput with Cumulative Flow Diagrams
  - Inspecting system constraints using throughput
  - Using throughput to support empirical forecasting
  - Trends in throughput across teams or time

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions treating throughput as a philosophy or belief
  - Topics that focus on generic improvement culture without referencing throughput metrics
  - Content that uses throughput as a proxy for personal productivity

  subtitle: Measure the efficiency of work completion over time to enhance flow and delivery performance in your processes.
  content: Throughput is a core observability metric that quantifies the volume of work completed over time. It is used to inspect system flow, detect bottlenecks, and inform empirical decision-making. Content should explore throughput trends, visualisations, and its relationship to other flow-based metrics such as lead time and cycle time.

Throughput is a key observability metric used to quantify the amount of work a system completes over a specific time period. It reflects the flow of value and helps teams inspect how effectively their system delivers completed work items. Unlike productivity measures, throughput captures system performance as a whole, not individual contribution.

By tracking throughput, teams can detect trends, identify constraints, and assess whether workflow changes result in meaningful improvements. Tools like cumulative flow diagrams and flow analytics help visualise throughput data in real time. In Agile and Lean contexts, throughput is often used with lead time and cycle time to inspect flow health and predict delivery.

Throughput enables empirical inspection. It provides feedback that informs decision-making and guides adjustments in work-in-progress limits, team composition, and planning cadence. Observing throughput over time supports transparency and continuous improvement, without relying on subjective performance assessments.
