The depth of discussion (5.5) is moderate, focusing on how throughput enables feedback, inspection, and adjustment, but lacking detailed ties to Continuous Delivery principles, automation, or deployment. The intent (5.8) is to inform about throughput for process enhancement, which aligns tangentially—improving delivery is relevant, but not exclusively targeted at Continuous Delivery.
