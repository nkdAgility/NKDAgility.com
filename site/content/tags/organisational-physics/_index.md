description: Applying systems thinking to understand and influence organisational dynamics.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Organisational Physics.**  
  The category of Organisational Physics focuses on the application of systems thinking to comprehend and influence the dynamics within organisations. It seeks to understand how various elements within an organisation interact and affect overall performance, promoting a holistic view of organisational behaviour.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Systems thinking principles and their application in organisational contexts.
  - The interplay between organisational structure, culture, and processes.
  - The impact of feedback loops and emergent behaviours on organisational effectiveness.
  - The role of complexity and adaptive systems in organisational change.
  - Techniques for mapping and analysing organisational dynamics.
  - The influence of leadership and decision-making on organisational systems.
  - Case studies demonstrating the application of systems thinking in real-world organisations.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that do not relate to systems thinking or organisational dynamics.
  - Misinterpretations of systems thinking that do not align with established theories.
  - Content focused solely on individual behaviours without considering the organisational context.
