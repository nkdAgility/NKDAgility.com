Instructions: |-
  Use this category only for discussions on Definition of Workflow.

  **Scope and Purpose:**  
  This category is strictly for content that addresses the Definition of Workflow as articulated in Kanban and related agile, DevOps, and product development contexts. The Definition of Workflow refers to the explicit, dynamic agreements and policies that make the flow of work through a value stream visible and understandable. Its purpose is to clarify how work is selected, initiated, managed, and completed, thereby enhancing transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. This concept is rooted in the Kanban Guide and the works of Daniel Vacanti, Donald Reinertsen, and John Little, and is relevant to teams seeking to make their processes explicit and adaptable.

  **Key Topics to Include:**
  - The Definition of Workflow as a set of explicit agreements and policies governing the flow of work.
  - Entry criteria: conditions that must be met for work to enter the workflow.
  - Work-in-progress (WIP) limits: constraints on the amount of work allowed in progress at any time.
  - Exit policies: clear definitions of what it means for work to be considered complete at each stage.
  - The role of the Definition of Workflow in making work visible, legible, and open to inspection and adaptation.
  - The distinction between Definition of Workflow (Kanban) and Definition of Done (Scrum), including how Scrum teams may visualise workflow without formally defining it.
  - The use of Definition of Workflow to support process improvement, adaptability, and team collaboration.

  **Strict Exclusions:**
  - Do not include content focused solely on the Definition of Done, acceptance criteria, or checklists unrelated to workflow policies.
  - Exclude discussions of micromanagement, prescriptive process enforcement, or static process documentation.
  - Do not classify content that discusses workflow in generic, non-Kanban, or non-agile terms, or that misinterprets the Definition of Workflow as a fixed or unchanging process.
  - Exclude unrelated project management methodologies or operational procedures not grounded in Kanban or agile theory.

  **Summary:**  
  Classify only content that explicitly discusses the Definition of Workflow as a dynamic, explicit model for managing and improving the flow of work, in alignment with Kanban and agile philosophies. Exclude content that misrepresents, oversimplifies, or diverges from these core principles.

abstract: The Definition of Workflow in the context of Kanban is a dynamic and explicit model that outlines how work progresses through a value stream, making the flow of work visible and understandable. Rather than being a fixed checklist, it consists of clear agreements and policies that determine how work is selected, initiated, managed, and completed. Key elements include entry criteria, which specify when work is ready to begin; limits on work in progress, which help manage capacity and focus; and exit policies, which define what it means for work to be considered finished at each stage. This approach is not intended for micromanagement but to enhance the transparency and legibility of the system, enabling teams to inspect and continuously improve their processes. In Kanban, the Definition of Workflow is central to making work explicit and fostering a culture of ongoing refinement. While Scrum does not formally define a Definition of Workflow, it incorporates related concepts such as the Definition of Done and encourages teams to visualise their work. Understanding and applying a Definition of Workflow is valuable in agile, DevOps, and product development environments because it clarifies expectations, supports collaboration, and provides a foundation for process improvement and adaptability.

In Kanban, the Definition of Workflow (DoW) is not a static checklist. It is a dynamic model of how work flows through a value stream, and how progress is made visible. The Kanban Guide defines it as the **explicit agreements and policies** that guide how work is selected, started, progressed, and completed.

It includes:

- **Entry criteria**: What makes work ready to enter the system.
- **WIP limits**: How much can be in progress at once.
- **Exit policies**: What constitutes ‘done’ for each state.

> It’s how you define “what we mean when we say we’re doing the work.”

This isn't about micromanagement. It's about making the system **legible**, so we can improve it. Kanban treats workflow as something we inspect and evolve. Not define once and forget.

## The implications of a Definition of Workflow in Scrum

Scrum doesn’t explicitly define a “Definition of Workflow,” but it does have a **Definition of Done (DoD)** and expects teams to visualise their work.
