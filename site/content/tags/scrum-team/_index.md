title: Scrum Team
abstract: A Scrum Team is a fundamental component of the Scrum framework, tasked with delivering value through iterative and incremental work. Comprising a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers, the team operates collaboratively towards a unified Product Goal. Characterised by its self-managing and cross-functional nature, the Scrum Team eschews sub-teams and hierarchies, holding collective accountability for producing a usable Increment at the end of each Sprint. While individual members may have specific roles, the team's shared responsibility encompasses all facets of product delivery, including stakeholder engagement, development, validation, and release. This structure empowers the Scrum Team to autonomously manage its work, making it a vital element in agile methodologies, DevOps practices, and effective organisational design. Understanding the dynamics and responsibilities of the Scrum Team is crucial for navigating complex and adaptive environments, as it highlights the importance of collaboration and accountability in achieving successful product outcomes.

A Scrum Team is the core accountability in Scrum, responsible for delivering value through iterative, incremental work. It consists of a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers, working collaboratively toward a single Product Goal.

The Scrum Team is self-managing and cross-functional. It has no sub-teams or hierarchies, and it is collectively accountable for creating a usable Increment every Sprint. Each member may hold a distinct accountability, but the team itself is responsible for the outcome.

Unlike roles or practices, the Scrum Team is an entity defined in the Scrum framework, empowered by the organisation to manage its own work. Its accountability spans all aspects of product delivery, from stakeholder collaboration and development to validation and release.

This tag is used to explore the nature, structure, and responsibilities of the Scrum Team as a wholeâ€”not just how the individuals interact, but what they are collectively accountable for in complex, adaptive environments.
