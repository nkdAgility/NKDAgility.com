description: Applying Kanban principles at scale for better flow and efficiency in large organisations.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Scaling Kanban.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the application of Kanban principles in large organisations to enhance flow, efficiency, and collaboration across multiple teams and departments. It focuses on how to implement Kanban at scale while maintaining the core values and practices of the Kanban methodology.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles of Kanban and their application in large-scale environments.
  - Strategies for visualising work across multiple teams and departments.
  - Techniques for managing dependencies and improving flow in complex systems.
  - Case studies and examples of successful scaling of Kanban in organisations.
  - Metrics and measurements for assessing flow and efficiency at scale.
  - Integration of Kanban with other frameworks and methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum).
  - Challenges and solutions in scaling Kanban practices.
  - Continuous improvement and feedback loops in a scaled Kanban context.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions that deviate from the core principles of Kanban, such as unrelated Agile methodologies that do not incorporate Kanban practices, or misinterpretations of Kanban's application in non-scaled environments.
