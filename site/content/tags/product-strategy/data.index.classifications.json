The depth is moderate: the narrative explains why strategy matters, references alignment, and gives examples of focus and coordination, but does not explicitly describe frameworks or techniques for common goals. The intent is closely aligned (informative, practical), and the target audience (product leaders, teams) matches the category, though technical practitioners may find it less hands-on.

The content aligns well conceptually (7.0) because product strategy, especially when described as adaptive and customer-informed, can enable organisational agility, but it makes a deliberate distinction that strategy is distinct from agile frameworks, slightly lowering the alignment score. The Depth of Discussion (7.1) is moderate, as it goes beyond surface-level description to elaborate on feedback loops, alignment, and cross-functional teams, but doesn't thoroughly explore agile-specific practices, leadership, or continuous improvement. The Intent (6.8) focuses on informing and supporting organisations in strategic planning rather than specifically addressing agility enhancement, so it's relevant but not a perfect fit. Audience Alignment (8.4) is higher, as product strategy discussions are targeted at organisational leaders, strategists, and cross-functional team leadsâ€”the same general audience interested in organisational agility. Signal-to-Noise (7.2) is reasonable because the content remains on-topic throughout, though not strongly focused on agility itself.

There is no direct or implied reference to throughput as a delivery metric: 'throughput' is never named or described, and the content does not discuss measurements of completed work items, team delivery capacity, or empirical delivery metrics. The intent is to inform about strategic product planning rather than operational or delivery metrics. Key areas such as throughput analysis, visualisation (e.g. Cumulative Flow Diagrams), and empirical forecasting based on delivery rates are completely absent. The audience is strategic/leadership, not delivery or flow practitioners. Minimal relevance comes from the vague mention of 'predictably and sustainably delivering value', but this is a general outcome of product strategy, not an analytical approach focused on throughput metrics. Therefore, all scores are heavily weighted toward zero, with small nonzero points for slight tangential alignment (0.4 in alignment, 0.2 in mentions and depth for the abstract connection to value delivery, and 0.7 in intent for generic relevance to improvement). No penalties apply since the content is neither outdated nor contradicts the tag's framing. This justifies a 'Tertiary' level with ultra-low confidence.",

The explicit references are minimal, with little expansion.\n\nAlignment (4.850): Although cross-functional teams are acknowledged as actors who benefit from product strategy, the main theme is the broader vision and roadmapâ€”cross-functional teams are context, not subject.\n\nDepth (3.960): The discussion elaborates on product strategy's relationship to teams in passing, but there is no substantial exploration of the nature, structure, or practices specific to cross-functional teams. For instance, there is no detailing of team makeup, roles, collaboration, or Agile cross-functionality.\n\nIntent (3.920): The focus here is on informing about product strategy, positioning cross-functional teams as beneficiaries of the strategy rather than exploring how such teams operate or are formed. Thus, the intent is tangential, not central to the category purpose.\n\nAudience (7.000): The primary audience is likely product leaders, managers, and those involved in strategy, which often overlaps with those interested in Agile or cross-functional collaboration; however, it's slightly broader than the direct audience for 'Cross Functional Teams.'\n\nSignal (6.100): The content is focused with some relevance; however, only a small portion is directly pertinent to cross-functional teams, with most content centered on product strategy, making much of it tangential for this category.\n\nNo penalties apply.
