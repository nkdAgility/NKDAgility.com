description: Applying empirical evidence to drive leadership decisions and improvements.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Evidence Based Leadership.**  
  This category focuses on the application of empirical evidence to inform and enhance leadership decisions and organisational improvements. It emphasises the importance of data-driven approaches in leadership practices, ensuring that decisions are based on solid evidence rather than intuition or anecdotal experiences.

  **Key Topics:**
  - The principles of Evidence-Based Management as outlined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
  - Techniques for gathering and analysing data to inform leadership decisions.
  - The role of metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) in assessing team performance and organisational health.
  - Case studies demonstrating the impact of evidence-based practices on leadership effectiveness.
  - Strategies for fostering a culture of evidence-based decision-making within teams and organisations.
  - The relationship between evidence-based leadership and Agile methodologies.
  - Tools and frameworks that support evidence-based leadership, including the use of feedback loops and retrospectives.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that focus solely on personal leadership styles without reference to empirical evidence.
  - Content that misinterprets evidence-based practices as merely relying on subjective opinions or experiences.
  - Topics unrelated to leadership, such as technical implementations or specific Agile practices that do not connect to leadership decision-making.
