ClassificationType: tags
trustpilot: false
abstract: The Agile Product Operating Model (APOM) is an operating model that integrates agile methodologies with contemporary product management principles, enabling organisations to consistently deliver value through a product-centric approach. As a specialization of the Product Operating Model, APOM addresses the specific need to shift away from traditional project-based approaches, which often emphasise rigid timelines and budgets, toward continuous value delivery and responsiveness to customer feedback. This model is crucial in the context of agile, DevOps, and product development as it aligns organisational efforts around well-defined outcomes, ensuring that every product has clear boundaries, stakeholders, and measurable value. By integrating elements such as business and technology roadmaps, operational stability, and governance, APOM allows organisations to adapt swiftly to market changes while maintaining a clear connection to their strategic goals. Furthermore, it emphasises evidence-based decision-making, fostering transparency and collaboration across teams, which enhances the ability to manage and optimise product value effectively. While non-agile product operating models are possible, APOM provides the recommended approach that empowers organisations to shape their unique operating models, driving sustainable value creation in a dynamic environment.

The Agile Product Operating Model (APOM) is an operating model that combines contemporary product management strategies with agile ways of working, providing organisations with a solid basis for consistently delivering value. As a specialization of the [Product Operating Model]({{< ref "/tags/product-operating-model" >}}), APOM is specifically designed for organizations adopting agile methodologies. It embodies a product ethos, aligning the entire organisation around well-defined and measurable outcomes.

## Shifting from Project to Product Ethos

Traditional project thinking typically centres around fixed milestones and rigid planning, measuring success narrowly by adherence to timelines and budgets. While projects can serve specific purposes within an organization, an over-reliance on a project mindset restricts flexibility, hinders team adaptability, and distracts from a clear and consistent focus on delivering genuine value.

In contrast, APOM promotes a product ethos that focuses on continuous delivery of value, clear definition of desired outcomes, and responsiveness to customer and market feedback. Products act as vehicles through which organisations strategically invest, manage resources, and consistently deliver value. Ideally, every product should have clearly defined boundaries, recognised stakeholders, distinct users, and measurable value, aligning the entire organisation around real customer requirements.

### Integrating Projects Within a Product-Centric Model

Even within a product-centric operating model, project-like initiatives may be necessary for specific cross-product concerns. For example, regulatory compliance efforts (such as GDPR) or platform modernization may impact multiple products simultaneously. In these scenarios, product leadership carefully balances these overarching needs with specific product goals, integrating specialized teams as key stakeholders who actively influence Product Backlogs to ensure alignment and value maximisation. The key difference is that these efforts remain subordinate to product outcomes rather than becoming the primary organizing principle.

## Defining the Agile Product Operating Model

An operating model itself isn't new, it provides a holistic framework describing how a company delivers on its strategy. APOM specifically adapts this concept for products within agile contexts, embedding agility into the organisational fabric. As a specialization of the Product Operating Model, APOM emphasizes iterative delivery, continuous feedback loops, and evidence-based decision making. Each product operates under its tailored Agile Product Operating Model, capable of evolving in response to insights and market dynamics.

The Agile Product Operating Model integrates Professional Scrum, product thinking, and contemporary product management practices to enable organisations to swiftly adapt, evolve, and deliver valuable, customer-focused products. As an agile-specific specialization of the Product Operating Model, each product within APOM incorporates:

- **Business Roadmap**: Clearly connecting the product to broader business strategy.
- **Technology Roadmap**: Defining how technology will evolve to support strategic goals.
- **Operational Stability**: Transparent service levels for clarity.
- **Governance and Flow**: Management and control of changes.
- **Total Cost of Value**: Understanding the economics of value and cost.

### Core Components of APOM

The Agile Product Operating Model consists of interconnected elements reinforcing one another:

- **People and Organisation**: Clear roles, responsibilities, and organisational structure.
- **Measures and Incentives**: Data-driven performance indicators and communication of success.
- **Agile Processes**: Methods for collaboration, communication, and iterative delivery.
- **Governance**: Clear decision-making frameworks, oversight, and control mechanisms.
- **Culture and Behaviour**: Core values, beliefs, attitudes, and rules influencing actions.

The Agile Product Operating Model is not a prescriptive or one-size-fits-all approach; instead, it offers flexible guidance enabling organisations to craft their own agile product-centric operating model. Organisations don't 'implement' APOM as a fixed framework, they actively shape and continuously adapt their version of it, reflecting their unique circumstances and evolving requirements. This adaptability is what distinguishes APOM from rigid frameworks or methodologies.

## Evidence-Based Decision Making

Transparency and visibility underpin effective decision-making. By making critical information readily accessible, organisations empower teams and leaders to make informed decisions, break down silos, and foster a culture of open communication and continuous learning.

[Evidence-Based Management (EBM)]({{< ref "/tags/evidence-based-management" >}}) is fundamental to the Agile Product Operating Model, ensuring decisions are grounded in measurable outcomes and purposeful experimentation. By openly sharing these outcomes, teams can effectively manage, measure, and optimise product value. EBM promotes continuous improvement, precise measurement of value, proactive risk management, and strategic investment decisions, prioritising empirical evidence over intuition or bias.

The Agile Product Operating Model isn't merely about agility for its own sake; it leverages agile principles and practices, aligning teams and stakeholders around products as primary drivers of sustainable, measurable value. As a recommended specialization of the Product Operating Model for modern organizations, APOM provides the operating foundation that enables teams to deliver value continuously, adapt to change rapidly, and maintain strategic alignment even as markets and customer needs evolve.
