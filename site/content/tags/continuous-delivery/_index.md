Continuous Delivery is a disciplined software delivery practice aimed at producing software in short, reliable cycles, ensuring that it can be released at any moment. It involves consistently delivering small, incremental improvements directly into the hands of real users, from the very first iteration.

According to Jez Humble, Continuous Delivery is:

> "The ability to get changes—features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments—into production or into the hands of users safely, quickly, and in a sustainable way."

This practice allows teams to rapidly validate assumptions, gather user feedback, and iterate towards the most valuable outcomes. By automating key elements like testing, integration, and deployment, Continuous Delivery reduces the risk of errors, improves software quality, and accelerates time-to-value.

Teams embracing Continuous Delivery can swiftly adapt to market demands and stakeholder feedback, fostering a culture of continuous learning, innovation, and responsiveness.
