Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Continuous Delivery.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses the principles, practices, and methodologies that enable teams to deliver software changes to production in a safe, efficient, and automated manner. Continuous Delivery (CD) aims to ensure that every change made to the codebase is production-ready, allowing for rapid deployment with minimal manual intervention.

  **Key topics to be discussed under this category include:**
  - The principles and practices of Continuous Delivery as outlined by Jez Humble and Dave Farley.
  - The role of automation in testing, integration, and deployment processes.
  - Strategies for maintaining a production-ready state of the codebase.
  - The importance of version control and branching strategies in CD.
  - Techniques for managing and mitigating deployment risks.
  - The relationship between Continuous Delivery and DevOps practices.
  - Metrics and feedback loops that support Continuous Delivery initiatives.
  - Case studies and real-world applications of Continuous Delivery in organisations.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of Continuous Delivery, such as unrelated software development methodologies, project management practices not tied to CD, or misinterpretations of the Continuous Delivery framework.
