abstract: Continuous Delivery is a software delivery practice that focuses on producing software in short, reliable cycles, enabling teams to release updates at any time. Originating from the need for more efficient and responsive software development processes, it involves delivering small, incremental improvements directly to users from the initial stages of development. This approach, as defined by Jez Humble, emphasises the ability to safely and quickly implement changes—such as new features, configuration adjustments, and bug fixes—into production. The importance of Continuous Delivery lies in its capacity to facilitate rapid validation of assumptions and collection of user feedback, which are crucial for refining products and achieving valuable outcomes. By automating essential processes like testing, integration, and deployment, Continuous Delivery not only mitigates the risk of errors but also enhances software quality and accelerates the time it takes to deliver value to users. Teams that adopt this practice can more effectively respond to market demands and stakeholder input, thereby fostering a culture of continuous learning, innovation, and adaptability within their organisations.

Continuous Delivery is a disciplined software delivery practice aimed at producing software in short, reliable cycles, ensuring that it can be released at any moment. It involves consistently delivering small, incremental improvements directly into the hands of real users, from the very first iteration.

According to Jez Humble, Continuous Delivery is:

> "The ability to get changes—features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments—into production or into the hands of users safely, quickly, and in a sustainable way."

This practice allows teams to rapidly validate assumptions, gather user feedback, and iterate towards the most valuable outcomes. By automating key elements like testing, integration, and deployment, Continuous Delivery reduces the risk of errors, improves software quality, and accelerates time-to-value.

Teams embracing Continuous Delivery can swiftly adapt to market demands and stakeholder feedback, fostering a culture of continuous learning, innovation, and responsiveness.
