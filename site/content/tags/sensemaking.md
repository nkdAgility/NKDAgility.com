Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Sensemaking.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore how organisations can interpret complex situations and environments to make informed, effective decisions. Sensemaking involves understanding the dynamics of complexity and uncertainty, enabling teams to navigate challenges and adapt strategies accordingly.

  **Key topics to discuss under this category include:**
  - The principles of sensemaking in complex environments.
  - Frameworks and models that aid in understanding complexity, such as the Cynefin Framework.
  - Techniques for gathering and interpreting data to inform decision-making.
  - The role of leadership in fostering a culture of sensemaking within teams.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful sensemaking in organisations.
  - The interplay between sensemaking and Agile methodologies, particularly in responding to change.
  - Tools and practices that enhance collective sensemaking among team members.

  **Strictly exclude** any content that does not directly relate to the interpretation of complexity, decision-making processes, or the application of sensemaking in organisational contexts. Avoid discussions that focus solely on technical implementations, project management without a sensemaking perspective, or unrelated theories that do not contribute to understanding complexity.
