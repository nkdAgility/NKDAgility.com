Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Automated Testing.**  
  The purpose of this category is to explore the principles, practices, and methodologies associated with automated testing in software development. It focuses on how automated testing contributes to software quality, reliability, and efficiency in the delivery process.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - The role of automated testing in Agile and DevOps environments.
  - Types of automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, etc.).
  - Best practices for implementing automated testing frameworks.
  - Tools and technologies for automated testing (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, TestNG).
  - Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices related to automated testing.
  - Strategies for maintaining and updating automated test suites.
  - The impact of automated testing on team collaboration and feedback loops.
  - Metrics and measurement of testing effectiveness and software quality.

  **Strictly exclude** discussions on manual testing, unrelated software development practices, or misinterpretations of automated testing principles that do not align with the Agile, DevOps, or Lean philosophies.

  title: Automated Testing
  subtitle: Enhance software reliability and speed up delivery by automating tests to identify issues early and minimise manual intervention.
  content: Enhancing software quality through systematic testing practices enables early detection of defects, reduces reliance on manual processes, and streamlines the delivery pipeline. Posts should explore test automation frameworks, integration strategies, continuous testing methodologies, and the impact of testing on overall project efficiency and team dynamics.
