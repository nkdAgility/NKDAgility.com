Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Backlog Refinement.**  
  Backlog Refinement is a critical Agile practice aimed at enhancing the clarity, prioritisation, and readiness of items in the product backlog. This process ensures that the team has a well-defined understanding of upcoming work, allowing for efficient planning and execution in future sprints.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and purpose of Backlog Refinement in Agile and Scrum frameworks.
  - Techniques for effective backlog prioritisation, including MoSCoW and Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF).
  - Best practices for defining user stories and acceptance criteria.
  - The role of the Product Owner in backlog management and refinement.
  - Collaboration techniques for involving the development team in backlog discussions.
  - The impact of backlog refinement on sprint planning and overall team productivity.
  - Tools and methodologies that support backlog refinement, such as user story mapping and estimation techniques.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to Agile practices or Scrum methodologies.
  - Misinterpretations of backlog refinement as merely a task list update or administrative function.
  - Content that does not align with the principles of collaboration, transparency, and iterative improvement inherent in Agile philosophy.
