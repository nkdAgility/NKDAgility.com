description: Platform engineering is a discipline within software development that focuses on designing and building internal platforms to enhance developer productivity and streamline the application lifecycle. These internal platforms, often referred to as Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), provide self-service capabilities, standardized tools, and automated workflows, enabling developers to efficiently develop, deploy, and manage applications.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Platform Engineering.**  
  Platform engineering is a discipline within software development that centres on the design and construction of internal platforms aimed at improving developer productivity and optimising the application lifecycle. These platforms, known as Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), offer self-service capabilities, standardised tools, and automated workflows, which empower developers to efficiently create, deploy, and manage applications.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Platform Engineering
  - Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and their components
  - Enhancing developer productivity through platform solutions
  - Automation in the application lifecycle
  - Self-service capabilities for developers
  - Standardisation of tools and processes in software development
  - Integration of DevOps practices within platform engineering
  - Case studies and best practices in implementing IDPs

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile, Scrum, or Lean without a direct connection to platform engineering
  - Content that focuses solely on external platforms or services not related to internal development processes
  - Misinterpretations of platform engineering that do not align with the core principles of enhancing developer efficiency and application management.
