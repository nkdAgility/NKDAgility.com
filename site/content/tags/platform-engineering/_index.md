title: Platform Engineering
abstract: Platform Engineering is the discipline focused on the design, construction, and maintenance of internal platforms that empower developers to deliver value independently, reliably, and swiftly. Originating from the need to streamline software development processes, it aims to alleviate cognitive load by abstracting the complexities of infrastructure and operations through well-crafted interfaces, tools, and APIs. This approach treats platforms as products, ensuring clear ownership, regular feedback, and ongoing enhancements based on developer requirements. A robust platform engineering capability fosters paved paths and self-service tools that facilitate secure, observable, and resilient software delivery while avoiding constraints that stifle innovation. By creating an environment conducive to rapid feedback, safe experimentation, and autonomous delivery across teams, Platform Engineering not only provides essential tools but also cultivates a cohesive developer experience that aligns with organisational strategy, ultimately enabling continuous value delivery at scale.

Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Platform Engineering.**  
  Platform engineering is a discipline within software development that centres on the design and construction of internal platforms aimed at improving developer productivity and optimising the application lifecycle. These platforms, known as Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), offer self-service capabilities, standardised tools, and automated workflows, which empower developers to efficiently create, deploy, and manage applications.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Platform Engineering
  - Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) and their components
  - Enhancing developer productivity through platform solutions
  - Automation in the application lifecycle
  - Self-service capabilities for developers
  - Standardisation of tools and processes in software development
  - Integration of DevOps practices within platform engineering
  - Case studies and best practices in implementing IDPs

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile, Scrum, or Lean without a direct connection to platform engineering
  - Content that focuses solely on external platforms or services not related to internal development processes
  - Misinterpretations of platform engineering that do not align with the core principles of enhancing developer efficiency and application management.

Platform Engineering is the practice of designing, building, and maintaining internal platforms that enable developers to deliver value independently, reliably, and at pace.

It focuses on reducing cognitive load by abstracting infrastructure and operational complexity behind well-designed interfaces, tools, and APIs. These platforms are treated as products, with clear ownership, feedback loops, and continuous improvement driven by developer needs.

A well-functioning platform engineering capability provides paved paths and self-service tooling that support secure, observable, and resilient software deliveryâ€”without enforcing constraints that limit innovation. It creates the conditions for fast feedback, safe experimentation, and autonomous delivery across teams.

The outcome of Platform Engineering is not simply tools, but a coherent developer experience that aligns with organisational strategy and enables continuous value delivery at scale.
