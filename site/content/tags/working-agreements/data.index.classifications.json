    "reasoning": "The content on 'Working Agreements' discusses team norms and collaboration principles, emphasizing alignment, responsibility, and enabling effective teamwork. However, it does not directly or repeatedly reference 'Common Goals,' strategy-execution alignment, or frameworks like OKRs. Instead, it addresses psychological safety, accountability, and operational clarity at the team level, which can be supportive of Common Goals but are not themselves the primary subject. \n\nDirect Mentions (2.7): The phrase 'goals' is only mentioned once, near the end, and 'common goals' or equivalent are not directly referenced. Most of the content is about behavioural norms, not shared objectives per se.\nConceptual Alignment (6.1): The core ideas—alignment, cohesion, and reducing conflict—are enablers of pursuing common goals. Still, the discussion doesn't link these norms directly to the concept of aligning individual/team work with organizational strategic goals as defined in the category.\nDepth of Discussion (6.6): The article explores the purposes of working agreements with substantial detail but does not analyze how these relate specifically to strategic or common goals, or connect to Agile/DevOps goal structures.\nIntent/Purpose Fit (6.9): The intended audience is those looking to foster effective teamwork, which can be related to Common Goals, but the main purpose is establishing operational norms.\nAudience Alignment (7.2): The content is aimed at agile teams and organizations interested in effective collaboration, overlapping with the Common Goals audience but slightly more tactical/practitioner-focused.\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (7.4): The content is focused, relevant, and free from filler, but only tangentially addresses Common Goals, resulting in a slight deduction.\n\nOverall, while 'working agreements' are a foundational practice in Agile and indirectly support common goals by promoting alignment, the article does not stay within the strict scope of the 'Common Goals' classification; it treats alignment at a behavioural/process level more than a shared strategic objective level.

Only minor indirect language ('organisation', 'systemic change') hints very weakly at a larger context, but it is not explicit or frequent.\n- Alignment (3.5): The core ideas—collaborative norms, team behavior, and continuous improvement—are foundational to Agile but not specific to large-scale agility. Alignment is partial and peripheral: the content brushes against organisational impact, but the focus is clearly on individual teams, not scaling.\n- Depth (3.9): The discussion is moderately thorough regarding team working agreements but offers only surface-level relevance to large-scale agility. It does not address multi-team alignment, cross-organisational frameworks, or leadership/metrics at scale.\n- Intent (3.3): The main purpose is to inform about working agreements for teams, not to explore the scaling of Agile across an organisation. It could indirectly support a scaled Agile context, but that is not its intent.\n- Audience (4.6): The primary audience is team facilitators, Scrum Masters, or Agile coaches at the team level. However, there is some relevance to Agile change agents or leaders interested in culture and systemic team practices within a broader enterprise.\n- Signal (5.4): Most of the content is focused, but almost exclusively about team-level Agile. Only brief references (e.g., 'systemic change') relate to larger contexts, providing slightly elevated signal for large-scale agility but not enough for primary or secondary classification.\n\nOverall, while there are glancing references to systemic or organisation-wide impact, the content is overwhelmingly about a single team's internal practices—not the principles or frameworks of scaling Agile across multiple teams or an enterprise. Hence, it receives a 'Tertiary' level with very low confidence for the 'Large Scale Agility' category.",

The content is fairly deep on the general topic (working agreements) but not on the target category. Score: 4.85.\n\nIntent / Purpose Fit: The main intent is informational and supportive of Agile values and collaborative team formation. While resonant with certain Open Space Agile principles, it isn't purpose-built or distinctly aligned to Open Space Agile transformation, so the fit is modest (5.75).\n\nAudience Alignment: The material is targeted at Agile teams, facilitators, or coaches, who overlap partially with the Open Space Agile audience (practitioners of collaborative change).

There are no explicit or even indirect references to 'Trend Analysis,' nor are there mentions of trends, patterns, metrics, or longitudinal changes associated with Agile, DevOps, or business agility. \n\n(1) Mentions (0.6): Trend analysis is not mentioned at all, neither directly nor peripherally.\n(2) Alignment (2.2): The discussion aligns with topics associated with Agile teams but does not focus on identifying or analysing trends.\n(3) Depth (2.3): The depth is about the rationale for working agreements, not rooted in exploring or evaluating the evolution of these practices as trends.\n(4) Intent (2.0): The purpose is educational regarding team norms, not to inform strategy based on trend data, metrics, or analysis.\n(5) Audience (4.0): The intended audience (Agile practitioners, teams) overlaps with those interested in trend analysis but the content itself doesn't directly appeal to strategists or decision-makers focused on trends.\n(6) Signal-to-Noise (6.1): The content is on-topic regarding team collaboration, with little filler, but from a 'Trend Analysis' perspective, almost all of it is 'noise' as it does not meet the classification's strict definition.\n\nNo penalties are applied as the content is not outdated, nor does it contradict or satirize the subject. Overall, this resource at best has a tertiary, tangential link to 'Trend Analysis', as it could inform trend-watchers of what working agreements are, but it is not directly nor indirectly about trend identification, analysis, or strategic implications based on trends.",

    "reasoning": "The content provides a thorough overview of working agreements, focusing on how they improve team collaboration, accountability, and adaptability. While it tangentially references broader themes of organisational change—such as promoting resilience, agility, and systemic change—it never directly mentions core frameworks (like ADKAR), explicit Agile transformation, or leadership-driven change initiatives. The content’s main audience appears to be practitioners or team leads rather than executives or strategists driving entire organisational change, but it does touch on long-term systemic change as an outcome. \n\nScores explained:\n- Mentions (2.0): The term 'organisational change' is not explicitly mentioned, nor are direct references to its frameworks; indirect language hints at broader change but never states it outright.\n- Conceptual Alignment (7.9): The concept aligns with organisational change in that fostering team agility and resilience via working agreements contributes to transformation, but the focus remains more tactical than strategic.\n- Depth (6.2): The discussion is moderately deep on how working agreements support team dynamics but only lightly touches on their role in broader organisational transformation.\n- Intent (7.1): The intent is to inform teams about effective collaboration, with some references to organisational impact; however, change management or transformation is not the primary focus.\n- Audience (7.6): While accessible to both practitioners and lower- to mid-level managers, it is less targeted to executive change agents; however, it is still relevant for those interested in agile teams' operations within organisational contexts.\n- Signal (8.2): The content is focused, relevant, and maintains a high signal, staying on the theme of team norms and their organisational effects without drifting into unrelated topics.\n\nNo penalties were applied, as the content is current and maintains a neutral-to-supportive tone. The overall confidence reflects that, while the content is related to organisational change (especially in the context of modern, agile organisations), it is not a definitive or primary resource for the category. Thus, it is classified as 'Secondary' relevance.",

    "reasoning": "This content discusses working agreements as norms and principles designed to improve team collaboration, communication, and performance. It aligns conceptually with organisational psychology through coverage of group behaviour, team cohesion, accountability, and the cultivation of psychological factors like trust and shared expectations. \n\n1. Direct Mentions (3.7): There is no explicit mention of 'organisational psychology' or named psychological theories, but terms like 'collaboration', 'team norms', and 'culture of accountability' are present, which reflect related psychological concepts.\n\n2. Conceptual Alignment (8.5): The piece strongly aligns with organisational psychology—especially in its focus on team dynamics, group norms, psychological safety (implied), and the impact on organisational culture and performance. However, it does not overtly reference foundational theories or delve into motivation or leadership by name, which keeps the score below the maximum.\n\n3. Depth of Discussion (7.9): The content goes beyond surface-level statements, addressing how working agreements impact team behaviour, accountability, conflict reduction, and organisational change. However, it could be deeper by referencing explicit psychological models or theory.\n\n4. Intent / Purpose Fit (8.2): The main intent is to inform about best practices for teams in collaborative contexts, which aligns closely with the field’s intent of fostering effective organisational environments.\n\n5. Audience Alignment (7.9): The intended audience could include team leads, managers, or organisational facilitators—slightly more practitioner-oriented than academic, but well within the applied focus of organisational psychology.\n\n6. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (8.1): The content is tightly focused (few tangents or filler), with all paragraphs reinforcing the main theme of collaboration and shared norms affecting team dynamics.\n\nNo penalties are applied, as the article is current, neutral, and has a constructive informational purpose. The absence of explicit named theories or models keeps this content at the ‘Secondary’ rather than ‘Primary’ level, since it broadly fits but does not represent a core, theory-driven piece typical of primary organisational psychology literature.",
