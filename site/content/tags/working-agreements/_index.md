abstract: Working agreements are foundational norms and principles that teams establish to improve collaboration and effectiveness in their work processes. Originating from the need for clear communication and decision-making frameworks, these agreements delineate how team members interact and fulfil their responsibilities, thereby fostering a shared understanding of expectations. Their importance is underscored in agile and DevOps environments, where accountability and trust are essential for delivering consistent value.

Working agreements are essential norms and principles established by teams to enhance collaboration and effectiveness in their work. These agreements define how team members interact, communicate, and make decisions, fostering a shared understanding of expectations and responsibilities. By creating a clear framework for behaviour and engagement, working agreements enable teams to operate more cohesively, reducing misunderstandings and conflicts.

The significance of working agreements lies in their ability to promote a culture of accountability and trust, which is vital for delivering value predictably and sustainably. When teams align on their working agreements, they can focus on their objectives without the distraction of interpersonal friction. This alignment supports continuous improvement, as teams can regularly revisit and refine their agreements based on evolving needs and experiences.

Moreover, working agreements contribute to long-term systemic change within an organisation. They empower teams to self-organise and adapt to challenges, fostering resilience and agility. By embedding these agreements into the team's fabric, organisations can cultivate an environment where collaboration thrives, ultimately leading to enhanced performance and value delivery. The clarity and commitment that working agreements provide are crucial for navigating the complexities of modern product development and ensuring that teams remain aligned with their goals and values.
