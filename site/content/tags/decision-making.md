  **Use this category only for discussions on Decision Making.**  
  The scope of this category encompasses the application of structured, evidence-based methodologies to facilitate informed decision-making within organisations. It aims to enhance the quality of choices made by leveraging data, empirical evidence, and collaborative insights.

  **Key topics that should be discussed under this category include:**
  - Evidence-Based Management principles and practices, as outlined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.
  - The role of data analytics and metrics in guiding business decisions.
  - Techniques for fostering collaborative decision-making within teams.
  - The impact of cognitive biases on decision-making processes.
  - Frameworks for evaluating and prioritising options based on empirical evidence.
  - The integration of feedback loops to refine decision-making over time.
  - Case studies demonstrating successful evidence-based decision-making in Agile and DevOps environments.

  **Strictly exclude** any discussions that deviate from the core principles of structured decision-making, such as anecdotal evidence, personal opinions without empirical support, or unrelated business strategies that do not align with evidence-based practices.
