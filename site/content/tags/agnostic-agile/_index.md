Agnostic Agile is a movement that champions a flexible, context-driven approach to agility, prioritising principles over rigid frameworks. It encourages teams to adapt their methodologies based on specific needs rather than adhering strictly to a single ideology. This pragmatic stance allows practitioners to draw from a variety of approaches, including Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP, fostering an environment where critical thinking and professionalism thrive.

By focusing on value delivery, Agnostic Agile enables teams to respond effectively to changing circumstances, ensuring that they can deliver value predictably and sustainably. This adaptability is crucial in todayâ€™s fast-paced environments, where the ability to pivot and innovate can significantly impact an organisation's success.
