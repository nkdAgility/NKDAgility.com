title: Acceptance Test Driven Development
description: Drive high-quality software development with Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). Define clear, testable acceptance criteria before implementation to ensure alignment with business needs.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD).**  
  Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) is a collaborative approach to software development that emphasises the importance of defining clear, testable acceptance criteria before the implementation of features. This practice ensures that the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements, ultimately leading to higher quality software that aligns with business needs.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Definition and principles of Acceptance Test Driven Development
  - The role of acceptance criteria in the development process
  - Collaboration between stakeholders, developers, and testers in ATDD
  - Techniques for writing effective acceptance tests
  - The impact of ATDD on software quality and project success
  - Comparison of ATDD with other testing methodologies (e.g., Test Driven Development)
  - Real-world case studies and examples of ATDD implementation
  - Tools and frameworks that support ATDD practices

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - General discussions on Agile or Scrum without a focus on acceptance testing
  - Content that misrepresents ATDD as solely a testing phase rather than a collaborative development approach
  - Topics unrelated to acceptance criteria, such as coding practices or design patterns that do not directly relate to ATDD principles.
