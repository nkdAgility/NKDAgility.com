Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Scaled Agile.**  
  The Scaled Agile category focuses on the methodologies and frameworks that enable the implementation of Agile practices across multiple teams and at an enterprise level. It encompasses the principles and practices that facilitate collaboration, alignment, and delivery of value in large-scale environments.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Frameworks for scaling Agile (e.g., SAFe, LeSS, Nexus)
  - Coordination and collaboration among multiple Agile teams
  - Enterprise-level Agile transformation strategies
  - Role of leadership in scaling Agile practices
  - Integration of Agile with traditional project management approaches
  - Metrics and performance indicators for scaled Agile initiatives
  - Challenges and solutions in scaling Agile across an organisation
  - Case studies and success stories of scaled Agile implementations

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions that focus solely on individual Agile practices without reference to scaling
  - Content that misrepresents the principles of Agile or its application in a non-scaled context
  - Topics unrelated to the coordination and management of multiple teams or enterprise-level initiatives

  title: Scaled Agile
  subtitle: Scaling agile methodologies across teams and enterprises, integrating Lean, DevOps, and Evidence-Based Management for enhanced collaboration and delivery.
  content: |-
    This classification focuses on the application of Agile principles across larger organisations, where multiple teams collaborate to deliver value efficiently. Itâ€™s all about extending Agile practices beyond individual teams to create a cohesive framework that supports enterprise-level initiatives. By integrating methodologies like Lean, Kanban, and DevOps, organisations can enhance their agility and responsiveness to change.

    Posts in this classification should explore key topics such as the implementation of Scaled Agile Frameworks (SAFe), the role of leadership in fostering a culture of collaboration, and the importance of Evidence-Based Management in decision-making. Additionally, discussions around the challenges of scaling Agile, the interplay between complexity theory and organisational dynamics, and practical insights from thought leaders in the field will provide valuable perspectives for those looking to navigate the complexities of Scaled Agile.
