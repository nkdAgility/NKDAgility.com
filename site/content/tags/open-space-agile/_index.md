description: Open Space Agile is an approach to organisational agility that applies the principles of Open Space Technology—a self-organising, agenda-free format for large group collaboration—to Agile transformation. Popularised by Daniel Mezick and others in the Open Leadership Network, Open Space Agile invites everyone in the organisation to co-create the change process, fostering psychological safety, shared ownership, and authentic engagement. Rather than relying on top-down rollout plans, it embraces emergence, letting those closest to the work define priorities and actions through open, iterative dialogue. This approach aligns with complexity thinking and honours the Agile ethos by enabling transformation to unfold organically, adaptively, and in response to real needs.

Open Space Agile is an innovative approach to organisational agility that leverages the principles of Open Space Technology, allowing for self-organisation and collaborative engagement across large groups. This method, championed by Daniel Mezick and the Open Leadership Network, empowers all members of an organisation to actively participate in shaping the transformation process. By fostering an environment of psychological safety and shared ownership, Open Space Agile encourages authentic dialogue and collective decision-making, moving away from traditional top-down strategies.

This approach is particularly effective in complex environments where adaptability is crucial. It aligns with the Agile ethos by promoting emergent practices that respond to the actual needs of teams rather than adhering to predetermined plans. Teams are encouraged to define their own priorities and actions, which enhances their ability to deliver value predictably and sustainably. Open Space Agile not only facilitates immediate collaboration but also cultivates a long-term culture of continuous improvement and innovation, making it a vital component of modern organisational frameworks. By honouring the voices of those closest to the work, it ensures that transformation is not just a process but a shared journey towards greater agility and responsiveness.
