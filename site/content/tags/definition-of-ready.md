Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Definition of Ready.**  
  The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a crucial Agile practice that ensures backlog items are well-defined and actionable before they enter the sprint planning phase. It serves as a checklist to confirm that user stories or tasks are sufficiently detailed, understood, and feasible for the development team to work on, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the sprint process.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Criteria for establishing a Definition of Ready.
  - Importance of clarity and detail in backlog items.
  - Role of the Product Owner in defining readiness.
  - Techniques for refining user stories to meet DoR.
  - Impact of a well-defined DoR on sprint planning and execution.
  - Common pitfalls in defining backlog items and how to avoid them.
  - Collaboration between team members to achieve a shared understanding of readiness.

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions on Definition of Done, as it pertains to the completion of work rather than its readiness.
  - General Agile principles that do not specifically address the criteria for backlog item readiness.
  - Misinterpretations of the DoR that deviate from its purpose of ensuring actionable standards for sprint planning.
