The closest it comes is in discussing empowered teams and the data-driven feedback loops that support team improvements, but these are implicit. \n- Conceptual Alignment (7.4): While self-organisation is not the focus, the core idea overlaps: tracking Lead Time provides teams with the empirical data needed to self-improve and potentially self-organise their workflow.

Direct mentions of 'Current Value' or its core metrics (customer satisfaction, revenue impact) are absent. However, Lead Time is positioned as a leading indicator that indirectly influences and signals value delivery, which conceptually overlaps with the category. Depth of discussion (7.5) is strong regarding Lead Time's measurement and implications for system improvement, but the discussion is not centered on direct, real-time assessment of value being realized by customers. Intent/purpose fit is moderate (5.8) since the main goal is explaining Lead Time, not evaluating Current Value directly—though the link to value delivery and performance is established. The audience score is high (8.2), as the content is clearly aimed at Agile/Lean practitioners and managers—the primary audience for Current Value discussions. The signal-to-noise ratio (8.0) is high due to focused, technical coverage. No penalties are needed as the content is contemporary, neutral in tone, and aligned with modern Agile/DevOps practices. Overall, while Lead Time is highly relevant for understanding and improving delivery—prerequisites for maximizing Current Value—it should be classified as 'Secondary' regarding Current Value, since it does not measure or discuss Current Value itself, but rather supports its achievement.",
