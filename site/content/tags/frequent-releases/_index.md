description: Ensuring continuous delivery of incremental improvements to users and stakeholders.
Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Frequent Releases.**  
  The category of Frequent Releases focuses on the practice of delivering software updates and improvements to users and stakeholders in a continuous and incremental manner. This approach is essential for enhancing user satisfaction, responding to market changes, and fostering a culture of agility within teams.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Principles of Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment
  - Techniques for automating the release process
  - Strategies for incremental improvements and user feedback integration
  - The role of DevOps in facilitating frequent releases
  - Metrics and KPIs for measuring release frequency and impact
  - Best practices for minimising risk during releases
  - Case studies demonstrating successful frequent release implementations
  - Tools and technologies that support frequent releases (e.g., CI/CD pipelines)

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Discussions unrelated to software delivery, such as project management methodologies not focused on release frequency.
  - Misinterpretations of frequent releases as merely increasing the number of releases without considering quality and user impact.
  - Content that does not align with the principles of Agile, DevOps, or Continuous Delivery as defined by the original theorists and practitioners.
