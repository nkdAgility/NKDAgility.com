abstract: Psychological safety is the shared belief within a team that it is safe to take interpersonal risks, allowing members to express their thoughts, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of negative repercussions.

Psychological safety is the shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. It allows team members to express their thoughts, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of negative consequences. This environment fosters open communication, enabling teams to collaborate effectively and innovate continuously. When individuals feel psychologically safe, they are more likely to contribute ideas, challenge the status quo, and engage in constructive feedback, all of which are essential for delivering value predictably and sustainably.

This concept is crucial for high-performing teams, as it directly impacts their ability to adapt and respond to challenges. By cultivating psychological safety, organisations can enhance employee engagement and retention, leading to improved performance and resilience. It supports a culture of learning, where experimentation is encouraged, and failures are viewed as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks. This long-term, systemic approach not only drives innovation but also aligns with agile principles, ensuring that teams can navigate complexity and uncertainty effectively. Ultimately, psychological safety is a foundational element that empowers teams to thrive in dynamic environments, fostering a culture of trust and collaboration that is essential for success in modern product development.
