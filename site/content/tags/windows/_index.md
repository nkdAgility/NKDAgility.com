abstract: Windows is the Microsoft operating system that serves as a foundational platform in organisational settings, enabling the installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of software applications and development tools. Its importance is underscored by its capacity to maintain productivity through consistent updates and security patches, which are vital for agile and DevOps methodologies. By standardising development environments, Windows reduces variability and complexity, thereby enhancing the predictability and sustainability of value delivery. This consistency promotes collaboration among cross-functional teams, as all members work within the same framework, which minimises integration challenges. Additionally, Windows supports automation in deployment and configuration processes, aligning with continuous delivery principles that facilitate rapid iterations and feedback loops. The operating system also integrates with essential tools and applications used in agile practices, such as Azure DevOps, empowering teams to optimise their workflows and respond effectively to evolving requirements and market dynamics. Ultimately, Windows provides a reliable foundation for software development and operational practices, contributing to the resilience and adaptability of organisations in an increasingly fast-paced digital environment.
