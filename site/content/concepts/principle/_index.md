A **principle** is a **fundamental, actionable belief** or **guiding rule** that shapes decision-making and behaviour within an organisation. It serves as a **framework for action**, ensuring that teams know **how to approach** their work in alignment with the organisation’s broader goals and values.

Principles provide **clarity** in dynamic environments. They are not abstract ideals but **actionable** guides that teams rely on to navigate complexity and uncertainty. For example, the principle of **Empiricism** encourages teams to make decisions based on **evidence** and **experience**, helping to ensure that choices are grounded in real-world data rather than assumptions. Similarly, the principle of **Self-Management** enables teams to organise themselves, take ownership of their work, and make decisions autonomously, which fosters empowerment and accountability.

Unlike **values**, which express what an organisation stands for, principles are **actionable** and **directly influence behaviour**. For example, the **Continuous Improvement** principle emphasises the need for teams to reflect on their processes and outcomes, striving to enhance their performance over time. This action-oriented focus ensures that principles don’t just shape **what** teams care about but also **how** they execute.

Principles also differ from **tenets** in that they are not specific doctrines or philosophies; they are guidelines that teams can actively apply to improve their processes. For instance, the principle of **Adaptability** encourages teams to respond to changing environments, ensuring they remain flexible and resilient.

The long-term value of principles lies in their **systemic nature**. They provide a stable foundation for decision-making across all levels of the organisation. Whether it's delivering **value to customers**, fostering a culture of **learning and collaboration**, or driving **innovation**, principles provide a consistent and coherent framework for achieving goals.

In summary, principles are the **guiding beliefs** that inform decision-making and influence how teams approach their work. They ensure **alignment**, drive **continuous improvement**, and enable teams to navigate challenges with confidence. By embedding these principles in the organisation’s culture, teams can adapt to change while staying focused on delivering sustainable value.
