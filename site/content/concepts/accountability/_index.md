Instructions: |-
  **Use this tag only for content focused on accountability as a structural concept.**  
  Accountability describes who owns the outcome in a system of work. It is distinct from task ownership or decision authority. This tag applies to posts that explore how clearly defined accountabilities improve transparency, alignment, and outcome responsibility in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps systems.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Defined accountabilities in Scrum (Scrum Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner)
  - The difference between accountability, responsibility, and authority
  - System-level outcomes and who owns them
  - Organisational design patterns that clarify or obscure accountability
  - Impact of misaligned or absent accountabilities
  - Evidence-Based Management and outcome ownership

  **Strictly exclude:**
  - Content focused solely on personal motivation or team values
  - General leadership philosophy not rooted in outcome ownership
  - Discussions of practices or methods not tied to structural outcome ownership

**Accountability** is a structural concept that defines **who is answerable for outcomes** in a system of work. Unlike task-level responsibility or decision-making authority, accountability is about owning the **result**, not just the activity.

In Scrum, there are three clearly defined accountabilities: **Product Owner**, **Scrum Master**, and **Developers**. These accountabilities clarify who is answerable for value, for the system of work, and for the delivery of Done Increments. Together, they form the accountability of the **Scrum Team**.

Accountability is essential in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps environments where self-management, decentralised control, and transparency are critical. Without it, organisations revert to unclear ownership, blame diffusion, or command-and-control.

Accountability differs from:

- **Responsibility**, which refers to the execution of tasks.
- **Authority**, which refers to the power to decide.
  A person may have authority without accountability, or responsibility without ownership of the outcome.

Clear accountabilities allow for inspection and adaptation. They enable organisations to make decisions based on evidence, detect delivery bottlenecks, and improve flow and value delivery.

Accountability is not a behaviour or value—it is a defined **structural mechanism** that supports clarity, alignment, and effective delivery in complex systems of work.
