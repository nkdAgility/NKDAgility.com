Instructions: |-
  **Use this category only for discussions on Method.**  
  The Method category encompasses structured, systematic approaches designed to achieve specific outcomes within Agile, DevOps, and Lean frameworks. This category focuses on methodologies that provide clear, repeatable processes to enhance efficiency, quality, and collaboration in software development and project management.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD): Principles and practices for writing tests before code to ensure quality and functionality.
  - Value Stream Mapping: Techniques for visualising and analysing the flow of materials and information to identify waste and improve processes.
  - A/B Testing: Methods for comparing two versions of a product to determine which performs better based on user feedback and data.
  - Feature Branching: Strategies for managing code changes in version control systems to facilitate parallel development and integration.
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Practices that automate the integration and deployment of code changes to enhance delivery speed and reliability.
  - Lean Methodologies: Approaches that focus on maximising value by minimising waste, inspired by Lean manufacturing principles.
  - Agile Estimation Techniques: Methods for estimating effort and time in Agile projects, such as Planning Poker and T-shirt sizing.

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - Discussions on unrelated frameworks or philosophies that do not pertain to structured methodologies.
  - Misinterpretations of the core principles of Agile, DevOps, or Lean that deviate from established theories and practices.
  - General discussions on software development that lack a focus on specific methodologies or structured approaches.

  title: Method
  subtitle: A systematic approach to achieving desired results through proven techniques and frameworks for effective project execution.
  content: A structured approach to achieving specific outcomes through iterative processes and empirical techniques. Posts should explore frameworks for workflow optimisation, continuous improvement, and performance measurement, emphasising collaboration, adaptability, and the integration of feedback to enhance project delivery and organisational effectiveness.
