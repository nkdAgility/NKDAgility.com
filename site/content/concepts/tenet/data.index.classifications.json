    "reasoning": "The content primarily explores the concept of 'tenets' as prescriptive, actionable rules within organizations, distinguishing them from values and principles. While it references Agile and Lean, there is no mention of Scrum Values specifically, nor are the five Scrum Values (commitment, courage, focus, openness, respect) discussed or exemplified. \n\nMentions (0.7): The term 'values' is mentioned as a contrasting concept, but 'Scrum Values' are not directly named or referenced. The focus is on tenets in a generic organizational and Agile context, with some allusions to values in a definitional sense. \nConceptual Alignment (2.1): The discussion aligns at a high level with organizational guidance and culture but not specifically with Scrum Values, which are narrowly defined within the Scrum Guide. The conceptual match is loose, mostly in the comparison between tenets and values (abstractly), not Scrum Values specifically. \nDepth (2.6): There is depth regarding what tenets are and how they relate to values and principles, but none of that depth is specifically about Scrum Values. No exploration of the five Scrum Values, their work within Scrum teams, or their significance. \nIntent (2.2): The piece aims to clarify the meaning of 'tenet' and compare it with value-based constructs. The intent is not to teach or focus on Scrum Values, but rather to clarify organizational constructs more broadly. Some relevance exists for audiences interested in values as a concept. \nAudience (8.2): The intended audience is aligned with those thinking about organizational guidance, Agile, Lean, and team practices, which would include Scrum practitioners. The content, however, is not scoped specifically to the Scrum Values audience. \nSignal (5.7): The bulk of the content is focused on defining tenets and comparing them to values and principles—relevant if the reader is searching for discussions of guidance frameworks, but lacking any specific focus on Scrum Values. No real off-topic or filler, but inherently not focused or particularly relevant to Scrum Values.\n\nNo penalties are applied because the content is up-to-date, neutral, and does not undermine the values or the concept. Overall, the confidence is low for this content fitting under 'Scrum Values', as connections are peripheral and not primary in purpose or substance.",

Though the examples reference frameworks like Kanban, Lean, and Agile—which can be relevant to ALM—the discussion centers on how tenets operate as actionable organizational rules more generally. There is no discussion of tools, governance, lifecycle phases, or metrics specific to ALM, and no systematic connection is drawn between tenets and the methodologies, processes, or tools characteristic of Application Lifecycle Management. The main intent is conceptual: to clarify how tenets guide behavior, rather than to illuminate the management of software applications across their lifecycle. The audience appears to be broad, potentially relevant to those in ALM but not specifically targeted, and the content is focused but off-topic per the ALM category. In summary, while the content could tangentially relate if tenets specific to ALM were discussed, this treatment is abstract and does not directly serve the category, resulting in very low confidence and a 'Tertiary' level.",

    "reasoning": "The content provides an in-depth overview of 'tenets', explaining their role as specific, actionable guiding rules or doctrines. There is substantial discussion differentiating tenets from values and principles, highlighting that tenets are more prescriptive and actionable. The article references canonical examples such as 'Flow efficiency over resource efficiency' in Kanban, and ties in core themes like continuous improvement, decentralised decision-making, and operational alignment. However, while principles are acknowledged and compared, the main focus is clarifying what distinguishes tenets conceptually and practically from principles. Thus, the conceptual alignment is significant but not complete; 'principle' is not the primary subject but is contextualized as a closely related concept. \n\nThe mentions score (5.7) reflects several explicit comparisons to principles, but direct use of the term 'principle' is intermittent and typically comparative or explanatory, so not dominant. The alignment (7.9) is strong because it thoroughly maps the core characteristics that principles share with tenets—actionable, guide behaviour, influence decision-making—with clear ties to Agile/Lean/DevOps thinking. The depth (7.1) is notable—multiple dimensions, examples, and organizational impacts of tenets are discussed, but deep treatment of principles themselves is secondary. The intent (7.0) is largely educational and directed at distinguishing and understanding guidance frameworks (values, principles, tenets), so is adjacent, not directly central to 'principle'. The audience (7.4) is well aligned (practitioners, leaders, technical audiences in agile, lean, etc.), and the signal (6.8) is high, with focused, relevant content but periodic shifts to clarification and comparison rather than direct principle discussion.\n\nNo penalty points were incurred as the content is up to date, neutral or supportive in tone, and not contradictory to the category framing. The level is 'Secondary' because while principles are directly addressed and contrasted, the primary intent is to define and contextualize tenets, making principles an adjacent focus.\n\nThis results in a balanced confidence score (70.3), proportional to the degree of relevance and substance with respect to the 'Principle' category without overstating the fit.",

The discussion includes references to Agile, Kanban, Lean, and continuous improvement, as well as explicit mentions of feedback mechanisms ('reflect on their processes and outcomes'). However, there is only a sparse direct connection to metrics, data, or evidence-based methodologies.\n\n1. Direct Mentions (1.7): The term 'Metrics and Learning,' or closely related terminology (metrics, measurement, data, feedback loops), is scarcely mentioned. The phrases 'continuous improvement' and 'reflection' are present but do not reference metrics directly or in a recurring manner.\n\n2. Conceptual Alignment (5.9): The idea of tenets is tangentially connected to Metrics and Learning, especially regarding fostering continuous improvement, adaptability, and learning culture. Still, the core of the content is about prescriptive rules/doctrines, not about how data, metrics, or feedback are gathered or used to learn and improve.\n\n3. Depth of Discussion (6.1): The depth around the concept of tenets (how they shape decision-making, difference from values/principles, practical application in Agile/Lean) is fairly strong, but the direct exploration of metrics, learning cycles, or feedback mechanisms is minimal. The only substantial related example is about continuous improvement in Lean, but without delving into measurement or data processes.\n\n4. Intent / Purpose Fit (4.5): The content’s main purpose is to define and differentiate tenets, not to discuss data, feedback, or learning mechanisms, though it touches on continuous improvement. Metrics and learning are not the primary themes, making the intent only weakly aligned.\n\n5.

Depth is moderate since tenets are described in length and with practical implications, though always at an abstracted level (i.e., as a mechanism for guiding organizational culture and behaviour) rather than in the context of value stream optimization. Intent is broadly relevant but not focused; it aims to help readers understand organizational guidance, not value stream enhancement specifically. The likely audience—organizational leaders, coaches, and team members interested in operational excellence—overlaps somewhat, but is not specifically the Value Stream Management audience. The content is tight and consistent with its main theme, but only tangential to the target category. No penalties were necessary since tone is neutral and content is current.

The Kanban example and references to Agile create a moderate but indirect link.\n- **Conceptual Alignment (6.7)**: The content aligns with some self-organisation principles, such as promoting autonomous action ('decentralised decision-making') and continuous improvement. However, self-organisation is not the central or explicit concept; rather, the focus is on how teams use tenets to guide decision-making.

However, it lacks an in-depth exploration or case studies on how tenets specifically create or reinforce self-organisation within teams. Most examples serve the main topic (tenets) rather than the category (self-organisation).\n- **Intent/Purpose Fit (6.1)**: The intent is informative and relevant for practitioners seeking cultural cohesion and guidance in decision-making.

The phrase 'continuous improvement' is directly mentioned in the context of Lean—closely tied to continuous learning—but as a tenet (i.e., a rule), not as a process or culture. \n\nMentions (3.3): Continuous learning is referenced less directly; the closest explicit phrase is 'continuous improvement', which gets a mention as a core tenet. While 'learning' and 'growth mindset' are implied (e.g., 'reflect', 'adaptation', 'ongoing refinement'), the content isn't directly naming 'continuous learning' repeatedly, so a low-mid score is warranted.\n\nAlignment (7.4): The alignment is strong in context. The text describes how tenets foster reflection, improvement, and adaptability—key aspects of continuous learning—but this is presented as a beneficial outcome of tenets, not as the main lens of the text. Nevertheless, several principles match the intent behind the category (culture, resilience, team adaptation).\n\nDepth (6.9): There is a moderate depth in explaining how tenets operate at both philosophical and actionable levels, including several examples (Kanban, Agile, Lean). However, the discussion on continuous learning per se is less in-depth—the details of actual learning or knowledge-sharing practices are not the focus; instead, they're side-effects of good tenets. \n\nIntent (7.0): The primary aim is educational toward the concept of tenets, indirectly supporting the goals of continuous learning (by fostering alignment and improvement), but it's not solely about continuous learning. The article serves as a useful adjunct to learning cultures rather than a direct guide or call to action for them.\n\nAudience (7.1): The audience appears to be managers, Agile coaches, and practitioners—matching the typical audiences for continuous learning in Agile/DevOps/Lean.

The alignment is weak since the main themes and intent remain centered on decision-making guidance and cultural consistency, not openness, visibility, or trust-building.

The low 'Direct Mentions' score (0.7) reflects only the faint connection; 'Alignment' and 'Depth' are also low relative to the category's direct meaning. The 'Intent' score is slightly higher because tenets could underpin frequent release practices, but the article’s main purpose is broader. Audience and Signal are higher because practitioners and leaders interested in frequent releases would likely be interested in tenets and the content is concise.

Direct Mentions (3.6): The content mentions Agile directly only once and does not discuss the Agile Manifesto, its core values, or principles by name. More attention is paid to definitions and examples from other frameworks (such as Kanban and Lean), with Agile referenced as one example among several.\n\n2. Conceptual Alignment (6.7): The content indirectly aligns with the discussed category by exploring key ideas foundational to Agile philosophically — specifically, the distinction between actionable tenets, organizational values, and principles, and references to concepts like continuous improvement, decentralised decision-making, and responsiveness. However, it is not solely or primarily aligned with Agile values and principles; it aims for conceptual generality.\n\n3. Depth of Discussion (6.2): It offers a moderately deep exploration of the distinctions between tenets, principles, and values, using concrete examples. The depth toward Agile is limited; instead, the depth lies in explaining tenets as a bridging concept and how they can connect philosophy to practice. Discussion of core Agile values/principles is not deeply explored.\n\n4. Intent / Purpose Fit (7.0): The main intent is explanatory—helping the reader understand the concept of tenets as distinct from values and principles within organizational/operational philosophies, including Agile. This is somewhat supportive of fostering a mindset for Agile but is not squarely focused on Agile values and principles themselves.\n\n5.

The closest thematic overlap is general references to continuous improvement, but this is not the same as CI in the context of software development.\n\n2. Conceptual Alignment (1.6): The content remains at a high, abstract level focusing on the notion of tenets as guiding doctrines. There is minimal alignment with core CI principles; only a tangential reference to 'continuous improvement' could faintly relate philosophically.

The core premise aligns with Software Development's focus on frameworks, practices, and effective team behavior.\n- Depth of Discussion (7.7): The document thoroughly explains what tenets are, their purpose, and offers multiple actionable software development examples. However, the discussion is evenly split between the general utility of tenets and their manifestation in software development, rather than offering an exhaustive treatment of software-specific tenets.\n- Intent/Purpose Fit (6.5): The intent seems educational, clarifying the difference between values, principles, and tenets, and offering organizational guidance. While it fits a software development audience, it is not solely targeted there—the insights are broadly applicable to any organizational setting that uses tenets. Thus, alignment is present but not exclusive.\n- Audience Alignment (7.8): The content appears geared toward practitioners and leaders involved in methodologies like Agile or Lean, but is accessible to wider organizational audiences outside software engineering. The writing is technical enough for practitioners, but also managerial in tone.\n- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (8.2): Nearly all content is relevant and substantial, with limited tangential commentary. The only dilution comes from general discussion of tenets outside strictly software development.\n\nNo penalties were applied; the content does not reference outdated practices or undermine the category. Overall, the piece sits at a 'Secondary' level in Software Development classification confidence—it is thematically and methodologically aligned, clearly relevant, but not exclusively about software development nor entirely embedded in its day-to-day technical practices.",

In terms of Conceptual Alignment, although there are ideas that resonate with the philosophy of Professional Scrum—such as actionable behaviour, continuous improvement, decentralised decision-making, and outcome-oriented culture—the content stays generic and uses examples from Kanban, Agile, and Lean, never anchoring the discussion in Scrum principles. Thus, alignment is modest at 3.2. The Depth is higher (3.8) since the piece gives a nuanced comparative discussion (tenets vs. values vs. principles), but it never links this discussion back to how these concepts underpin Professional Scrum specifically. The Intent is informational for those seeking general frameworks for operational behaviour, rather than targeting Professional Scrum practitioners or supporting its ethos (2.2). Audience Alignment is somewhat higher (4.1), as professionals interested in disciplined ways of working may benefit from this content, but it's not aimed specifically at Scrum Masters, Product Owners, or Scrum Teams. Signal-to-Noise is moderate (3.6): the content is well-written and focused on tenets, but other frameworks and philosophies take focus away from Scrum, and there's no filler but a lack of category-specific anchor. No penalties are applied, as the content is up-to-date, professional in tone, and not critical of Professional Scrum. Overall, the low direct relevance and weak alignment constrain this to a tertiary relationship, with a calculated confidence of 30.72, consistent with content that may resonate at a high-concept level but is not specific or strongly supportive of Professional Scrum.",

The audience could overlap marginally with those interested in Agile project management tools, but the content lacks any technical or applied discussion specific to Azure Boards. The low score for 'Direct Mentions' (0.7) reflects the total absence of any mention of Azure Boards. 'Conceptual Alignment' (2.5) is somewhat elevated because some Agile/Lean tenets theoretically underpin how teams might use tools like Azure Boards, but this connection is abstract and not developed. 'Depth' is low (1.6) as there is no exploration of boards, work items, or integrations. 'Intent' (2.1) is low because the intent is educational about tenets in general, not supportive of Azure Boards practice or adoption. 'Audience Alignment' (4.0) and 'Signal' (3.2) are modest: while the audience might have adjacent interests, the content is neither focused nor targeted. No penalties were applied since there is no outdated, critical, or undermining tone.

Still, there is adequate overlap with how tenets support value delivery practices. \n\nThe depth of discussion concerning value delivery is moderate: value delivery is referenced as a consequence of following appropriate tenets, with a few cross-framework examples (Kanban/Agile/Lean) illustrating how tenets embed practices that support value. However, the focus is on the conceptual role of tenets, not on in-depth strategies or assessment of value delivery effectiveness. \n\nFor intent/purpose fit, the goal is not to instruct directly on value delivery, but to clarify foundational guidance (tenets) that can underpin effective value-creating practices. This makes the fit supportive but not primary. \n\nThe audience is a reasonably close match: readers likely have roles in Agile, Lean, or team leadership, but the content aims broadly at organizational improvement, not only practitioners of value delivery. \n\nSignal-to-noise is high: the explanation is focused, with only brief digressions to distinguish tenets from values and principles. There are no outdated or contradictory references, so no penalties apply. \n\nOverall, the resource clearly relates to value delivery as a significant secondary theme, helping connect tenets to value-driving behaviors and culture, but it does not supply concrete value delivery frameworks, deep methodologies, or measurement techniques—thus, Secondary level, with a confidence score solidly in the moderate range.",

The content would support a broader article or course module on discipline as a foundational element.\n\nOverall, this evaluation yields a confidence of 76.582, reflecting strong and contextually meaningful—though not direct—coverage of how tenets function within professional disciplines, but stopping short of full, primary category focus.",

    "reasoning": "Direct Mentions (2.3): The content does not mention 'Agile Product Operating Model' (APOM) directly. It refers to 'Agile', 'Kanban', and 'Lean', but not APOM or specific frameworks within its scope. Conceptual Alignment (5.7): The discussion of tenets as actionable doctrines and their role in guiding organisational behaviour has thematic overlap with aspects of APOM (such as embedding behaviours, continuous improvement, decentralised decision-making), but is not explicitly aligned to APOM’s key topics. The examples given (e.g., Kanban flow efficiency, Lean continuous improvement) are generic agile/lean concepts, not exclusive to APOM. Depth (5.3): The content examines tenets in detail, but it does so generically (as a concept spanning philosophies like Agile, Lean, and Kanban). There is no discussion of APOM-specific structures, applications, or frameworks. Intent/Purpose Fit (4.1): The intent focuses on explaining 'tenet' as a general organisational or agile/lean concept, not specifically on APOM, making it only tangentially supportive to the category. Audience Alignment (6.4): The tone is broadly suitable for an audience interested in organisational philosophy, team leaders, and those interested in agile concepts. This overlaps somewhat with APOM’s target (leaders in agile product delivery or transformation), but is more general. Signal-to-Noise (7.2): The content is focused and relevant within its scope (discussion of tenets and their role in organisations). However, apart from a brief nod to decentralised decision-making as a 'core tenet in Agile', it lacks specificity to product-based operating models, so some of the signal is not directly about APOM. No penalties were warranted, as the content is not outdated, misleading, or satirical. In summary, while the discussion of tenets could underpin some APOM principles (e.g., continuous improvement, decentralised decision-making), it does not address the APOM framework directly or in-depth. Therefore, this resource is 'Tertiary' to the Agile Product Operating Model category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a conceptual explanation of 'tenet' as a prescriptive rule within organizations, differentiating tenets from values and principles, and providing illustrative examples mostly within Agile and Lean contexts. However, there is no direct mention of 'cross functional teams' or explicit focus on their definition, structure, or unique challenges. \n\nDirect Mentions (0.6): 'Cross functional teams' are not directly mentioned or referenced at all; the closest connection is generic references to 'teams' without specification.\n\nConceptual Alignment (2.4): The content aligns partially through its references to team decision-making, collective behavior, and Agile/Lean tenets, which can be components influencing cross-functional teams, but this is tangential. The main focus remains on the nature of tenets as actionable rules—not the specific topic of cross-functional team structure or dynamics.\n\nDepth of Discussion (2.7): The article goes in depth about tenets, giving practical and philosophical explanations as well as examples. However, none of these examples or explanations focus on cross-functional teams directly. There could be indirect relevance (since tenets could apply to cross-functional teams), but the article never explores this link in any depth.\n\nIntent / Purpose Fit (2.5): The primary intent is to clarify 'tenet' as a concept. Any relevance to cross-functional teams is extremely incidental.\n\nAudience Alignment (5.0): The target audience is likely Agile practitioners and organisational leaders, which partially overlaps with the Cross Functional Teams category, but is also broader (any team or organisational member).\n\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (2.5): Most of the article is off-topic regarding cross-functional teams, focused instead on general team guidance via tenets. Only a very small proportion could be relevant by loosest association (i.e., agile teams could be cross-functional).\n\nNo penalties were applied, as the content is current, not contradictory, and not satirical. Overall, cross-functional teams are several steps removed from the main point—making confidence very low, and the content at best a tertiary fit for the category.",

There is a brief mention of Agile and Lean, with passing reference to tenets such as 'decentralised decision-making' and 'continuous improvement,' but these are framed as overarching guiding doctrines rather than discussions about the creation or delivery of working software as a tangible artifact. The key concepts (definition, decision-making guidance, role in culture, etc.) are abstract and process-oriented, with minimal, indirect relevance to working software. \n\n-- Mentions (0.8): There are no direct mentions of 'working software' or related terms; references to Agile and Lean are secondary and context-setting only.\n\n-- Alignment (2.1): The discussion is about organizational philosophy and guidance, not specifically about creating, delivering, or evaluating working software as an artifact.\n\n-- Depth (1.9): The exploration is deep regarding the nature and function of tenets but offers nearly no substantive discussion about working software itself.\n\n-- Intent (2.2): The intent is educational about tenets, not working software; any alignment with working software is tangential and not explicit.\n\n-- Audience (3.2): The audience may overlap with those interested in Agile practices (possibly including practitioners), but the content primarily targets those interested in organizational philosophy, not those directly concerned with creating working software.\n\n-- Signal (2.1): The content is focused and relevant for its topic (tenets) but is largely off-topic when judged against the 'Working Software' category; nearly all content is about doctrine/philosophy rather than software deliverables.\n\nNo penalties were applied, as the content is up to date and not undermining the category.
