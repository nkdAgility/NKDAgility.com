  **Use this category only for discussions on Practice.**  
  The Practice category encompasses commonly used techniques, habits, or routines that contribute to achieving specific goals within Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Lean methodologies. This category aims to highlight actionable practices that enhance team performance, improve workflow efficiency, and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

  **Key Topics:**
  - Pair Programming: Collaborative coding practice that enhances code quality and knowledge sharing.
  - Continuous Deployment: Automated process of deploying code changes to production, ensuring rapid delivery of features.
  - Retrospectives: Regular meetings for teams to reflect on their processes and identify areas for improvement.
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD): Development approach where tests are written before code to ensure functionality.
  - Daily Stand-ups: Short, focused meetings to synchronise team efforts and address impediments.
  - Kanban Practices: Techniques such as visualising work, limiting work in progress, and managing flow.
  - Agile Estimation Techniques: Methods like Planning Poker and T-shirt sizing to estimate effort and complexity.
  - Value Stream Mapping: Lean technique to analyse and optimise the flow of materials and information.

  **Strictly Exclude:**
  - Theoretical discussions without practical application.
  - Personal opinions or anecdotes that do not relate to established practices.
  - Content that focuses on tools or software without linking them to specific practices.
  - Misinterpretations of practices that deviate from their original intent as defined by Agile, Scrum, DevOps, and Lean philosophies.
