We have already had great success with our immersive learning classes, with the 8-week Professional Scrum Product Owner gaining high acclaim not only from the students but also from their managers and leaders:

Five of the participants were from this one company, and the message above was from the CEO! I loved the experience, but I love the feedback even more.

Below, you will find our 24Q1 schedule and the awesome classes and bundles that we are bringing and *we have added a 20% discount on all classes until April 2024!*

**Extending the Learning Process**

Our courses are traditionally interactive 2-day learning experiences within a classroom setting, emphasizing valuable, hands-on outcomes. Immersion Training offers a refreshing alternative, breaking the class into shorter sessions across several weeks. This format not only extends learning into real-world business applications but also incorporates reflective sessions for continuous improvement, making it a highly effective and practical approach.

- **Incremental Classroom Learning**: In Immersion Training, classes are concise, live sessions spanning several weeks. Each session introduces and practices a new concept, allowing students to digest the material at a comfortable pace and ensuring a deep understanding before moving forward. Sessions are capped at 4 hours to keep learners engaged and to foster an effective learning environment.
- **Outcome-Based Assignments**: These assignments, tied to each classroom session, are designed to apply the concepts learned directly. They focus on outcomes rather than outputs, catering to various backgrounds and skill levels. The emphasis is on innovation and boundary-pushing, not just completion, making the assignments relevant for both new and seasoned learners.
- **Facilitated Reflections**: After the initial session, each class starts with a reflection period. Here, students and their Professional Scrum Trainer discuss the assignments, sharing challenges and successes. These sessions are vital for learning, encouraging peer interaction and actionable feedback, and fostering collective growth and understanding.

Starting in 2024, we will be running immersive classes in bundles as Learning Journeys that you can book together, or
