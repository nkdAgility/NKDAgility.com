It mentions continuous improvement and references Kanban, Scrum, DevOps, and product development, but nowhere does it explicitly mention or discuss the Definition of Workflow. Core topics such as explicit agreements, policies, entry/exit criteria, WIP limits, or workflow visualization per Kanban theory are entirely absent. There is no discussion distinguishing Kanban's Definition of Workflow from Scrum's Definition of Done. The closest related content is the broad mention of continuous improvement and making processes explicit via training, which only very tangentially overlaps with the category's focus. Therefore, the scores reflect an extremely weak, nearly nonexistent connectionâ€”no explicit mentions, no conceptual alignment, no depthâ€”and intent is primarily promotional, not educational in the category's sense. Audience and signal scores are the lowest, as the content is diffuse and not targeted to Kanban-focused practitioners.",
