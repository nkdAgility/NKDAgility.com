While the audience matches practitioners in agile and lean environments (hence high scores for audience and signal), the lack of any SLE-specific content results in minimal scores across mentions, alignment, depth, and intent. No penalties are warranted as the content is current and not critical of SLE, but it also falls outside the clear scope required for confident classification under this category.",

The focus is on roles, process, and lean methods, with some implied connection to value creation but lacking robust evidence of prioritizing measurable customer outcomes.
