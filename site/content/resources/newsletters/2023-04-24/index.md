The world is spinning faster than ever, with more players than ever.

The introduction of Chat GPT has excited a few people but alarmed many. Sure, Chat GPT is nowhere near as bright as many of the other AI projects in play. Still, it is already showing how mediocre, repeatable work can be designated to AI or automated. This a glimpse of a future where the minimum standard won’t be enough, and you’ll need to dig deeper and deliver high-value work.

As a member of our NKD Agility tribe, we do not doubt that you’re not canon fodder for AI, but it does beg the question of where and how you will level up. What are you doing to future-proof your work capabilities in future? Many people have completed the PSM course, but never progressed. Others have invested in the PSPO course but never progressed. Think about the people who have progressed and invested in coaching, mentoring, and skills development programs. Think about the gap between where you are now and where you want to be.

Agile and Scrum encourage and promote tough conversations. Moments of truth when we look each other in the eye and ask hard questions. Questions enable us to think about what tomorrow looks like, how we will contribute value – to our own lives and in our professional lives, and how we will stay one step ahead of our competitors – current or emerging.

If you’d like some career consulting or to ask a few questions about what better could look like, reach out to me at [martin@nkdagility.com](mailto:martin@nkdagility.com) or my LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinhinshelwood/)

As part of our commitment to building the next generation of super scrum stars, we’re paying for two people to level up in one of our APS (Applying Professional Scrum) or PSM II (Advanced Professional Scrum) courses. _**Simply go to my LinkedIn post for the competition and nominate a friend, a family member, a colleague, or a peer, and they could win a course.**_ If you want to be the person who wins the course, ask your friends to nominate you on the LinkedIn posts, and we’ll count those recommendations.
