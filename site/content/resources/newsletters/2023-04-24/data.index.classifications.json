    "reasoning": "This content discusses Agile, Scrum, career progression, and briefly references AI (ChatGPT) as automating repeatable work. However, it never directly addresses agentic software delivery as defined. There is no discussion of integration of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agency, or synergy between AI and human experts in software delivery. The AI mention is generic and pertains to career threat/opportunity, not to the delivery process or modern engineering practices for agentic systems. The bulk is a newsletter about training, giveaways, and events targeting Scrum practitioners. Minimal reference to AI, and none to agentic delivery concepts.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This is a general Agile/Scrum newsletter with only a token reference to AI automating work. It doesn't address agentic software delivery concepts, making it a poor fit for the category.",
