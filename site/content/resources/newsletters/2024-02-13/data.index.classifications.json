    "reasoning": "The content primarily promotes various Agile training courses rather than providing a structured discussion on frameworks. While it references Agile methodologies and mentions terms like Agile Kata, PSPO, and PSM, these are framed primarily as courses rather than in-depth explorations of the frameworks themselves. The discussion lacks a thorough examination of implementation strategies, comparisons, or adaptations of frameworks, which are crucial for aligning with the category. Thus, it receives a moderate score for mentioning Agile but lacks depth and direct focus on frameworks.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a promotional announcement for a series of Agile and Scrum training classes, highlighting topics like Agile Kata, facilitation, backlog management, evidence-based management, and other Agile practices. Nowhere in the text is Service Level Expectation (SLE) explicitly named or referenced. There is also no discussion, definition, application, or analysis of SLE concepts within the content. The closest related concepts—such as empirical management, experimentation, and continuous improvement—are discussed at a high level, but there is no direct or indirect address of the calculation, usage, or importance of SLE in Kanban, Scrum, or Agile frameworks. The content mainly targets practitioners (e.g., Scrum Masters, Product Owners) but is only relevant to SLE as far as their general interest in Agile; nothing is focused on SLE itself. Most of the content is about logistical details, course features, and promotional calls to action. Scoring reflects a near-complete lack of direct mention, conceptual alignment, or depth related to SLE, with only the audience aspect scoring higher due to the general Agile practitioner focus. No penalties applied, as the content is current and not contradictory.",
