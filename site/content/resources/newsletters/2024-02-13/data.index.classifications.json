    "reasoning": "The content discusses various Scrum-related training courses, including Professional Scrum Facilitation Skills and Professional Scrum Product Backlog Management Skills, which directly mention Scrum roles and practices. However, while it touches on Scrum principles, the focus is more on promoting training rather than an in-depth discussion of Scrum itself. The alignment with Scrum concepts is present, but the depth of discussion is primarily promotional rather than analytical.",
