    "reasoning": "The content never explicitly mentions Agentic Software Delivery, autonomous AI agents, or core concepts such as contextual intelligence, agent integration, or governance frameworks. Instead, the focus is on general Agility, upskilling, certifications, and Scrum/Agile course promotion. Agile practitioners are the audience, which partially overlaps, but none of the advanced topics in Agentic Software Delivery are present. There is no substantial alignment or depth regarding agentic discussion, no mention of AI integration, nor examples of agent-human synergy in delivery. The only slight fit is the agile delivery context, which is adjacent but not sufficient; thus, the confidence is very low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is general Agile/career skills advice and course listings; it does not address autonomy, AI agents, or agentic delivery principles. No substantive fit with Agentic Software Delivery.",
    "level": "Ignored"
