As a fellow agilist, you’ll know that agility is critical to success in the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous 21st-century marketplace.

Why? Because it empowers us to run experiments, frequently inspect, and regularly adapt. That’s how we navigate complexity. That’s how we create value, despite uncertainty, regardless of the industry or environment we serve.

How much Tupac have you got? How skilled, competent, and capable are you in navigating the competitive landscape we find ourselves in? What sets you apart from the pack?

Suppose you’ve watched Twitter and Facebook let go of thousands of employees and Amazon dropkick thousands of executives into touch. In that case, it’s because organizations are walking into a deep, dark, hard recession and are looking to cut back on people who aren’t clear about the value they bring to the table. People who might be good at executing basic orders but aren’t great at innovating and creating value.

People who aren’t in touch with their Agile, powerful, creative selves.

So, if you’ve brought your CV to HR and it sounds like Shania Twain’s 20-year reunion for ‘that don’t impress me much!’, maybe it’s time to upskill.

Maybe it’s time to combine everything you have learned since we last saw you for a Scrumorg course and build on that rock-solid foundation with a certification and skillset that does bring HR and hiring managers to the yard. I know the certification is valuable, but it’s what you’ll learn that it’s infinitely more valuable. What you’ll be capable of doing with these skills, models, and practices will set you apart.

Who knows, maybe that creative prowess extends into creating your own business or product? With our Applying Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) and [Professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) with User Experience (UX) courses, you’ll be flexing something fierce and demonstrating why you’re the most valuable employee/colleague/start-up partner of 2023. Remember to apply your alumni discount at checkout to capitalise on the benefits of being a naked Agility fan.

You’re welcome.
