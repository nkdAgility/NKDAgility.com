    - "The Agile 2023 Scotland Experience is almost upon us, and NKDAgility proudly sponsors the event!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-49710 size-full\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nkdagility-agile-2023-Scotland-Experiance.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere will be a keynote from Lyssa Adkins and many unique opportunities for workshops and talks, not to mention networking and catching up with friends. Apart from the fantastic talks, my favourite part of conferences is catching up with old friends and making new ones.\r\n\r\nI have spoken at Agile 2023 events and was in Nashville a few years ago for Deliver: Agile, this event's more technical sibling. Agile Alliance always runs events that challenge our thinking and provoke change, so come along and get inspired by fresh ideas you can use with your organisations, teams, and yourself.\r\n\r\nNKDAgility will provide free consulting and coaching for anyone who comes to our booth and emotional support from our resident fur baby Lua. So if you need to chat about handling the crazy things at your organisation while getting a hug from a sausage dog, then we are the place to be.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-49712 size-full\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-15_11-50-19-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"5832\" height=\"944\" />\r\n\r\nIf that is not enough, we will host a selection of board and card games for those interested in a wee break, including Cards Against Agility, and we would be willing to host Get Kanban on request and time willing.\r\n\r\nWe will have some flyers from our new immersive 7 to 10-week Scrum.org classes and be able to talk about why double-loop learning is better for the participants.\r\n\r\nBook now (Code: TALK23): <a href=\"https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK</a>\r\n\r\nSo join us on the 24th and 25th in Edinburgh with all the agile goodness of Scotland (and a Â£100 discount :)) with the code below. This conference is a great example of how the world has changed and the future of conferences is one of global simultaneous participation and collaboration accross the world. So join and support the experiment to create a sustainable world with conferences that come to you!\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/uGIhajIO3pQ\r\n\r\nI hope to see many faces I recognise there!\r\n\r\nYours in agile excellence,\r\n\r\nMartin Hinshelwood\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"null\">Upcoming Training Classes</h2>\r\nFind a class and location near you, or <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you want or want a private class for your organization.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"]\r\n\r\nFind a class and location near you, or <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you want or want a private class for your organization.\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Our Trainers</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"]\r\n<h2>What have we been up to?</h2>\r\nA short list of our blogs, videos, and webcasts!\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Blog Posts</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-NewsletterBlogPostList\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Videos</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">The Future of Work in Scotland Webcasts</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4>Agile Actually Podcast</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"agile-actually\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h2>What classes are right for you</h2>\r\nAll of <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/\">our classes</a> are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are or would like to be!\r\n<h4><strong>Everyone</strong>\_- Working in an evolving company</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Scrum Masters</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Developers / Scrum Teams</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help all members of the Scrum Team improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Product Owners / Product Managers</strong></h4>\r\ntraining to help product managers improve their abilities.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Managers</strong></h4>\r\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<em>Contact me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization.</em>"
