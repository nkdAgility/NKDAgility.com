The Agile 2023 Scotland Experience is almost upon us, and NKDAgility proudly sponsors the event!

[![](images/nkdagility-agile-2023-Scotland-Experiance.png)](https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK)

There will be a keynote from Lyssa Adkins and many unique opportunities for workshops and talks, not to mention networking and catching up with friends. Apart from the fantastic talks, my favourite part of conferences is catching up with old friends and making new ones.

I have spoken at Agile 2023 events and was in Nashville a few years ago for Deliver: Agile, this event's more technical sibling. Agile Alliance always runs events that challenge our thinking and provoke change, so come along and get inspired by fresh ideas you can use with your organisations, teams, and yourself.

NKDAgility will provide free consulting and [coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}) for anyone who comes to our booth and emotional support from our resident fur baby Lua. So if you need to chat about handling the crazy things at your organisation while getting a hug from a sausage dog, then we are the place to be.

If that is not enough, we will host a selection of board and card games for those interested in a wee break, including Cards Against Agility, and we would be willing to host Get [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) on request and time willing.

We will have some flyers from our new immersive 7 to 10-week [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}).org classes and be able to talk about why double-loop learning is better for the participants.

Book now (Code: TALK23): [https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK](https://events.agilealliance.org/aascotland2023/begin?i=L7wyli35dzYJ1d70S2e1mR-yDTlopQRK)

So join us on the 24th and 25th in Edinburgh with all the agile goodness of Scotland (and a £100 discount :)) with the code below. This conference is a great example of how the world has changed and the future of conferences is one of global simultaneous participation and collaboration accross the world. So join and support the experiment to create a sustainable world with conferences that come to you!

Yours in agile excellence,
