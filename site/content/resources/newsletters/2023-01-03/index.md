Welcome to this month's edition of NKDAgility.

In today's fast-paced, rapidly changing world, agility has become more important than ever. The ability to quickly adapt to new situations, pivot when necessary, and continuously improve is key to success in the 21st century.

In this edition, we will explore the importance of agility in today's world and how it can help organizations stay competitive and achieve their goals. We’ve selected a few of our most loved articles and videos on Agility and hope you find it valuable in your own journey towards agility.

- **The difference between traditional and empirical approaches** If your organization has become successful using traditional and project management approaches, it can be difficult to understand why change is necessary. In short, traditional approaches work just fine if you’re working in a simple or complicated space – such as building bridges or roads. You know how to do the work, you know all the variables, and you have a fair idea of how long it will take and how much it will cost to get the job done. In complex environments, everything changes, and you need a new style of working if you’re going to build products that customers love and outcompete innovative competitors. That’s where Empiricism comes into its own. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains the difference between traditional and empirical approaches. \[embed\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnyJzSwU74Q&ab\_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood\[/embed\]
- **Overview of The Scrum Framework with Martin Hinshelwood** Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum Framework is made up of five values, three Accountabilities, three artefacts, and five events.In this video, I'll go through an overview of each one, explaining what they are for and why they are there. The focus will be on the process itself, and we will leave the complementary practices until later.\[embed\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Fo3sM6BVo&ab\_channel=nakedAgilitywithMartinHinshelwood\[/embed\]
