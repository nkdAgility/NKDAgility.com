    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the difference between traditional and empirical project management, Scrum, and agility. It does not mention agentic software delivery or autonomous AI agents, nor does it discuss the integration of AI or contextual intelligence within delivery systems. Its themes are centered on traditional vs empirical process discussion, agility practices, and Scrum training, with no alignment to proactive or agentic software delivery concepts. The intended audience are Scrum practitioners and agile professionals, not specifically those exploring agentic (AI-centered) practices.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about agile, empirical vs. traditional approaches, and Scrum, not agentic software delivery. No reference to AI agents or agentic principles. Minimal fit with the category definition.",
