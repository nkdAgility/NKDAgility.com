Learning about scrum is important, but growing your capability to deploy and implement scrum effectively is way more important.

All the theory in the world doesn’t help if your team are grappling with the action elements. Actively doing the work, creating the product implement, integrating customer feedback and data into decision-making for the next product evolution. It often isn’t scrum that is the problem, it is a fundamental lack of knowledge and understanding around the core pillars of Empiricism that under pin scrum.

Transparency. Inspection. Adaptation.

One of my favourite courses to present, and most effective workshops to run with teams, is called Applying Professional Scrum (APS) and it may be the perfect opportunity for you.

- If you can’t build momentum and leverage continuous improvement.
- If you keep tripping on the basics and can’t effectively remove impediments.
- If you use scrum terms and attend scrum events, but don’t see improved times to market, increased customer satisfaction, and reduced costs.
- If you aren’t achieving your desired returns on agile investment.

If this looks and feels like you, watch a few of the videos below and gain some insight into how applying scrum professionally may be a game-changer for you.

### News: Agile Actually Podcast

My good friend Simon Reindl and I just started a podcast and the first episode is live on https://youtu.be/YiQFgl0JCRE:

Welcome to Agile Actually, the podcast that brings you authentic agile concepts, insights, and wisdom from two of the industry’s most respected, progressive agile experts. Hosted by Martin Hinshelwood and Simon Reindl, both of whom have extensive experience working with agile in a variety of industries in some of the most diverse applications on Earth, this podcast is a must-listen for anyone looking to improve their agile practice.

#### Episode 1: Life coaches masquerading as Agile Coaches

In this month’s edition of #agileactually, Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in #agile for a life coach to present themselves as an #agilecoach to organizations. In most cases, an #agilecoach or #agilecosultant will have years of experience as an #agilepractitioner, actively working in an #agileteam, followed by certification and practise as an #agilecoach leading multiple #agileteams in multiple applications.

That’s why it’s controversial that someone with very little #professionalcoaching skills and #agile knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an #agilecoach. Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly? Find out in this month’s Agile Actually Podcast.
