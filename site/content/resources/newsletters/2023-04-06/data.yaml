    - "<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">Learning about scrum is important, but growing your capability to deploy and implement scrum effectively is way more important.</p>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">All the theory in the world doesn’t help if your team are grappling with the action elements. Actively doing the work, creating the product implement, integrating customer feedback and data into decision-making for the next product evolution. It often isn’t scrum that is the problem, it is a fundamental lack of knowledge and understanding around the core pillars of Empiricism that under pin scrum.</p>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">Transparency. Inspection. Adaptation.</p>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">One of my favourite courses to present, and most effective workshops to run with teams, is called Applying Professional Scrum (APS) and it may be the perfect opportunity for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>If you can’t build momentum and leverage continuous improvement.</li>\r\n \t<li>If you keep tripping on the basics and can’t effectively remove impediments.</li>\r\n \t<li>If you use scrum terms and attend scrum events, but don’t see improved times to market, increased customer satisfaction, and reduced costs.</li>\r\n \t<li>If you aren’t achieving your desired returns on agile investment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">If this looks and feels like you, watch a few of the videos below and gain some insight into how applying scrum professionally may be a game-changer for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>https://nkdagility.com/blog/what-is-your-favourite-agile-course-to-deliver-and-why/</li>\r\n \t<li>https://nkdagility.com/blog/why-does-minecraft-make-the-aps-course-so-awesome/</li>\r\n \t<li>https://nkdagility.com/blog/how-does-the-aps-course-help-people-apply-scrum-effectively/</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">News: Agile Actually Podcast</h3>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">My good friend Simon Reindl and I just started a podcast and the first episode is live on https://youtu.be/YiQFgl0JCRE:</p>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">Welcome to Agile Actually, the podcast that brings you authentic agile concepts, insights, and wisdom from two of the industry’s most respected, progressive agile experts. Hosted by Martin Hinshelwood and Simon Reindl, both of whom have extensive experience working with agile in a variety of industries in some of the most diverse applications on Earth, this podcast is a must-listen for anyone looking to improve their agile practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">Episode 1: Life coaches masquerading as Agile Coaches</h4>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">In this month’s edition of #agileactually, Simon Reindl and Martin Hinshelwood explore the latest trend in #agile for a life coach to present themselves as an #agilecoach to organizations. In most cases, an #agilecoach or #agilecosultant will have years of experience as an #agilepractitioner, actively working in an #agileteam, followed by certification and practise as an #agilecoach leading multiple #agileteams in multiple applications.</p>\r\n<p data-ogsc=\"rgb(32, 32, 32)\">That’s why it’s controversial that someone with very little #professionalcoaching skills and #agile knowledge would present themselves to organizations as an #agilecoach. Good? Bad? Or just plain ugly? Find out in this month’s Agile Actually Podcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://nkdagility.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8f1debed5aa20a5cfafd20918&amp;id=f6710e10ae&amp;e=5683225470\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 124, 137)\" data-linkindex=\"3\">Spotify</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://nkdagility.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8f1debed5aa20a5cfafd20918&amp;id=d66afc96d2&amp;e=5683225470\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 124, 137)\" data-linkindex=\"4\">Amazon Music</a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"https://nkdagility.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8f1debed5aa20a5cfafd20918&amp;id=d75faff164&amp;e=5683225470\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-safelink=\"true\" data-ogsc=\"rgb(0, 124, 137)\" data-linkindex=\"5\">Audible</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 class=\"null\">Upcoming Training Classes</h2>\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"]\r\n\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Our Trainers</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"]\r\n<h2>What have we been up to?</h2>\r\nA short list of out blogs, videos, and webcasts!\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Blog Posts</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-NewsletterBlogPostList\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Videos</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4>Agile Actually Podcast</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"agile-actually\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h2>What Classes are Right for you</h2>\r\nAll of <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/\">our classes</a> are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are, or would like to be!\r\n<h4><strong>Everyone</strong>\_- Working in an evolving company</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Scrum Masters</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Developers / Scrum Teams</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help all members of the Scrum Team improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Product Owners / Product Managers</strong></h4>\r\ntraining to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Managers</strong></h4>\r\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<em>Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization.</em>"
