    - "Over the past few months, we’ve seen mass layoffs from tech giants around the world. From Amazon to Meta, and heaps of smaller organizations across the board.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with this, we’ve also seen a great deal of predictions for a rough 2023 from an economic perspective. A deep recession that is anticipated to last until the second quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nSo, what does your organization need to focus on to initially survive, and then thrive, through this period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity? How do you focus on consistently delivering value to customers and build competitive advantage when you have less people and financial resources than before? How do you galvanize the teams you have around creating and capturing value for customers in a way that aligns with organizational strategic objectives and goals?\r\n\r\nProduct Ownership is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nA great product owner acts like the CEO of the product and works closely with product development teams, customers, and product stakeholders to focus on building the most valuable product or solving the most compelling problems. They are laser focused on prioritizing work that delights customers and aligns with core organizational objectives – such as increasing customer loyalty and referrals – to ensure maximum returns on product development investments.\r\n\r\nTough gig, but it's also a game-changer when you get it right. In this short video, I talk about the kind of impact a strong, skilled product owner can have in your organization.\r\n\r\n[embed]https://youtu.be/S3Xq6gCp7Hw[/embed]\r\n<h3>Community</h3>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/community/\">Lean-Agile Practitioners Community</a> has grown to over 1300+ members, and new usability updates by our platform team will hopefully make it an even bigger success this year.\r\n\r\nIt's free to join the community, and our students get access to the <a href=\"https://community.nkdagility.com/spaces/5799644/feed\">Professional Scrum</a> space for 1-on-1 Coaching, The Situation Room, &amp; Tails from the Trenches!\r\n\r\n<em>Thank you very much to all who are making this community more extraordinary. </em>\r\n<h2 class=\"null\">Upcoming Training Classes</h2>\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2022-CourseSchedule-Newsletter\" limit=\"20\"]\r\n\r\nFind a class and location near you or\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/course-schedule/?scope=Public\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search</a>\_for more classes.\_<a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/company/general-inquiries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact us</a> if you don't find what you are looking for or want a private class for your organization.\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Our Trainers</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-Newsletter-Trainers\" limit=\"6\"]\r\n<h2>What have we been up to?</h2>\r\nA short list of out blogs, videos, and webcasts!\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Blog Posts</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-NewsletterBlogPostList\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\nAre there any blog posts that you would like me to write?\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">Recent Videos</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"nkdagility-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4 class=\"null\">The Future of Work In Scotland Webcasts</h4>\r\n[wp-rss-aggregator template=\"newsletter-list\" feeds=\"future-of-work-scotland-youtube\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h2>What Classes are Right for you</h2>\r\nAll of <a href=\"https://nkdagility.com/training/\">our classes</a> are listed on our site, but here is a list of classes based on who you are, or would like to be!\r\n<h4><strong>Everyone</strong>\_- Working in an evolving company</h4>\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" ids=\"10045\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Scrum Masters</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help Scrum Masters and Delivery Managers improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44705\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Developers / Scrum Teams</strong></h4>\r\nCourses to help all members of the Scrum Team improve their skills\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44700\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Product Owners / Product Managers</strong></h4>\r\ntraining to help Product Managers improve their abilities.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44704\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n<h4><strong>Managers</strong></h4>\r\nManage Scrum Teams indirectly.\r\n\r\n[wpv-view name=\"2023-CourseCatalogByAudience-Newsletter\" type=\"1\" wpvrelatedto=\"44706\" limit=\"5\"]\r\n\r\n<em>Reach out to me directly if you would like to schedule a private course at your organization.</em>"
