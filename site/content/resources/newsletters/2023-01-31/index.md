Over the past few months, we’ve seen mass layoffs from tech giants around the world. From Amazon to Meta, and heaps of smaller organizations across the board.

In conjunction with this, we’ve also seen a great deal of predictions for a rough 2023 from an economic perspective. A deep recession that is anticipated to last until the second quarter of 2024.

So, what does your organization need to focus on to initially survive, and then thrive, through this period of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity? How do you focus on consistently delivering value to customers and build competitive advantage when you have less people and financial resources than before? How do you galvanize the teams you have around creating and capturing value for customers in a way that aligns with organizational strategic objectives and goals?

Product Ownership is a great place to start.

A great product owner acts like the CEO of the product and works closely with product development teams, customers, and product stakeholders to focus on building the most valuable product or solving the most compelling problems. They are laser focused on prioritizing work that delights customers and aligns with core organizational objectives – such as increasing customer loyalty and referrals – to ensure maximum returns on product development investments.

Tough gig, but it's also a game-changer when you get it right. In this short video, I talk about the kind of impact a strong, skilled product owner can have in your organization.
