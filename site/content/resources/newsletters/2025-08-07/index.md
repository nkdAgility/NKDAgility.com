# Now in EST. Ready to Raise the Bar?

For the next six months, I‚Äôm operating in **Eastern Standard Time (EST)**. That means **real-time access** for organisations in the **US and Mexico** looking to raise the bar in **engineering excellence and technical leadership**.

If your teams are stuck gaming metrics, stuck behind theatre, or just stuck ‚Äî this is your chance to bring in real help that cuts through the noise and gets to the core of how delivery systems work.

As usual newsletter subscribers will receive exclusive insights and resources and the current focus is on **breaking the estimation trap** that‚Äôs holding back so many teams. These are preview posts that are not yet published on the main site.

## Hilight Preview Post: **The Estimation Trap** (Publishes in 46 days)

If you're still tracking estimate vs actual to manage delivery, you're not managing delivery. You're performing theatre.

The **[Estimation Trap](https://preview.nkdagility.com/resources/blog/the-estimation-trap-how-tracking-accuracy-undermines-trust-flow-and-value-in-software-delivery/)** breaks this down:

> _‚ÄúWhen performance is judged by how closely estimates match actuals, teams shift into survival mode. You don‚Äôt get more predictability. You get fear, silence, and a culture optimised for hiding reality.‚Äù_

That fear poisons delivery. Here's what I‚Äôm seeing in real teams:

- Engineers pad estimates to hit targets.
- Risky work gets buried or ignored.
- Delivery optics become more important than user outcomes.
- "Green" dashboards mask red-hot fires.

And it‚Äôs not just dysfunction. It‚Äôs **organisational self-sabotage**. The teams know it. Leadership suspects it. But no one says it out loud.

I do.

## What We‚Äôre Fixing Right Now

In the last month alone, I‚Äôve worked with teams to:

- Kill off fake velocity metrics and build actionable flow dashboards.
- Dismantle harmful estimation rituals that only serve PowerPoint.
- Design delivery systems built on evidence, not compliance.
- Align engineering effort with measurable product value, not stakeholder guesswork.

The result?  
Faster feedback, fewer surprises, and less theatre.
