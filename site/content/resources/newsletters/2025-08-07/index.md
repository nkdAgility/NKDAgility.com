title: Break organisational silos and stop tolerating bad branching models
short_title: Break Organisational Silos and Bad Branching
description: Explains how technical leaders can break down organisational silos and enforce better branching, team structures, and architecture to improve software delivery flow.
tldr: Software organisations fail when leaders tolerate poor system design, such as bad branching models, siloed teams, and business logic in databases. To improve delivery, leaders must enforce trunk-based development, restructure teams for cross-functionality and autonomy, and set clear architectural boundaries. Development managers are responsible for shaping systems that enable agility and flow, not just managing people or reporting on delivery.

**Subject:** Martin Hinshelwood in EST: Book Expert Support for Engineering Excellence  
**Preview:** Martin is in EST for 6 months and available for hands-on consulting in North America. This month’s spotlight: How tracking estimation accuracy is destroying delivery.

# Now in EST. Ready to Raise the Bar?

For the next six months, I’m operating in **Eastern Standard Time (EST)**. That means **real-time access** for organisations in the **US and Mexico** looking to raise the bar in **engineering excellence and technical leadership**.

If your teams are stuck gaming metrics, stuck behind theatre, or just stuck — this is your chance to bring in real help that cuts through the noise and gets to the core of how delivery systems work.

## This Month’s Focus: The Estimation Trap

If you're still tracking estimate vs actual to manage delivery, you're not managing delivery. You're performing theatre.

The **[Estimation Trap](https://nkdagility.com/resources/blog/the-estimation-trap-how-tracking-accuracy-undermines-trust-flow-and-value-in-software-delivery/)** breaks this down:

> _“When performance is judged by how closely estimates match actuals, teams shift into survival mode. You don’t get more predictability. You get fear, silence, and a culture optimised for hiding reality.”_

That fear poisons delivery. Here's what I’m seeing in real teams:

- Engineers pad estimates to hit targets.
- Risky work gets buried or ignored.
- Delivery optics become more important than user outcomes.
- "Green" dashboards mask red-hot fires.

And it’s not just dysfunction. It’s **organisational self-sabotage**. The teams know it. Leadership suspects it. But no one says it out loud.

I do.

## What We’re Fixing Right Now

In the last month alone, I’ve worked with teams to:

- Kill off fake velocity metrics and build actionable flow dashboards.
- Dismantle harmful estimation rituals that only serve PowerPoint.
- Design delivery systems built on evidence, not compliance.
- Align engineering effort with measurable product value, not stakeholder guesswork.

The result?  
Faster feedback, fewer surprises, and less theatre.

## Book a Real Conversation — No Fluff, No Pitch

If you’re ready to stop pretending and start improving, let’s talk.  
We’ll take 30 minutes, inspect your current system of delivery, and explore what’s holding your teams back.

👉 **[Book a free 30-minute call](https://nkdagility.com/company/contact/)**

There’s no sales script. Just candour, technical expertise, and pragmatic options.

See you soon.
