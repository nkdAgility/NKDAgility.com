The depth and conceptual match to 'Agentic Software Delivery' are minimal: leadership in an Agile context does relate to modern delivery, but this webcast makes no claims about agent-based tooling, autonomous AI, AI-human collaboration, or the specific engineering, governance, or feedback mechanisms that define the category. The audience could overlap, as both target Agile practitioners and leaders, but the webcast centers purely on process and transformationâ€”not technical agentic advancements.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about Agile leadership and transformationâ€”not Agentic Software Delivery. There is almost no topic, purpose, or conceptual overlap beyond a superficial link to modern delivery. Fit to category is negligible and indirect at best.",
    "level": "Ignored"
