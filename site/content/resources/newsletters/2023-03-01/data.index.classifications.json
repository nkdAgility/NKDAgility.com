Audience alignment is slightly higher (2.7), as the readers are agile practitioners and Scrum team members who could theoretically be interested in SLE if it were discussed, but the content doesn't target SLE-specific interests. Signal is low (1.1) since the vast majority of the content is unrelated to SLE.
