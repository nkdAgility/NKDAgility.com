    "reasoning": "The content describes immersive learning formats and Scrum training, with extensive discussion of course formats, participant engagement, and agile learning methods. However, there is no explicit mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor any discussion of its definition, calculation, or application within Agile, Scrum, or Kanban. Mentions are scored at 0.0 because 'SLE' or 'Service Level Expectation' do not appear. Conceptual alignment and depth are both minimal, since no themes match the SLE's core subject matter—the focus is solely on course logistics and learning approaches, not metrics or Agile flow forecasting. Intent is not aligned, as the purpose is to promote training and educational techniques, not SLE analysis. Audience alignment is slightly higher (2.7), as the readers are agile practitioners and Scrum team members who could theoretically be interested in SLE if it were discussed, but the content doesn't target SLE-specific interests. Signal is low (1.1) since the vast majority of the content is unrelated to SLE. Penalties were not applied, as the content doesn't contradict or criticize the SLE category, nor is it outdated or satirical. Overall, this content is almost entirely irrelevant to the Service Level Expectation category, justifying a very low confidence score.",
