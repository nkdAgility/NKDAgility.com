  - "<p>All you have to do to become a multi-dimensional free thinker is to change the way you think of your dyslexia. The benefits of having\_dyslexia far outweigh the negatives: The concepts of multi-dimensional thinking are incredibly difficult to learn if you have not been born with the ability, and if you are dyslexic, you have.</p> <p>The advantages of Multi-Dimensional thinking is that you can visualize problems from all different angles and provide a solution that would not have occurred to a linear thinker. Although <a title=\"The gift that keeps giving.\" href=\"http://www.sigmundvoid.com/?p=75\" target=\"_blank\">Sigmund Void</a> mentioned three dimensional thinking, the capability of thinking in more than three dimensions can assist you enormously if you are a software developer.</p> <p>I am not saying that all dyslexic people can think in more than three dimensions, but they are all <strong>capable</strong> of it: not everyone is...</p> <p>The advantages of being a Free Thinker are also incalculable.\_It adds a creative element to the way your brain works and makes incredibly complex ideas seam simple. The disadvantage is getting others to understand you, but this is off-set by dyslexic people usually having superb oral skills.</p> <p>Professions for such talented people include but is not limited to: </p> <p>engineers, architects, designers, artists and craftspeople, mathematicians, physicists, physicians (esp. surgeons and orthopedists), dentists, it professionals (esp. Software Development Engineers, Developer Evangelists and Software Architects).</p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia\" rel=\"tag\">Dyslexia</a>\_</div>"

      I was happy  reading you... I'm married with a great m.f.t. and my second
      song is a m.f.t. too. Live with them is not easy... but sure not 
      boring...Specialy with school it's a real challenge... but I hope, because
      I know my son is very special... Thanks

      I was born a Multi-Dimensional thinker with Forward Awareness along with
      some other weird issues and its been a hell of a ride, I envy normal
      people because nobody understands us.
