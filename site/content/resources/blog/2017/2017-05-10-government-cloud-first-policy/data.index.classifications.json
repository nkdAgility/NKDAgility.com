There are no references to SLE, cycle time measurements in an Agile context, or sources tied to SLE. The topic and intended audience do not align with the narrowly scoped SLE category: this targets a broad IT/government sector, not Agile practitioners seeking SLE guidance. There also is no tangential or passing mention of SLE. Audience is scored just above zero because both government IT practitioners and Agile teams may overlap in a very general sense, and signal rises slightly above absolute zero because of professional tone, but there is no substantial or thematic intersection. No penalties are applied as the content is neither outdated nor critical of SLE (it's simply unrelated).
