The discussion of values mostly addresses surface practices and usability, not foundational beliefs. The audience matches practitioners seeking project template advice, not those deeply reflecting on ethos. Thus, while there is some indirect alignment (e.g., advocating for authentically agile behaviors over vanity agile), it does not deeply engage with ethos as the underpinner of sustainable delivery or system evolution, and barely skims the relevant topics.
