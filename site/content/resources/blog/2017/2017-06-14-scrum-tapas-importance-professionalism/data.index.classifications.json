    "ai_penalty_details": "Mentions: no direct reference to agentic software delivery or related terminology. Alignment: content is outdated (references a 2017 event). Audience: partially misaligned due to general Scrum focus and lack of advanced agentic content.",
    "final_score": 14.0,
    "reasoning": "The content centers on professionalism and engineering excellence in Scrum teams, not on the integration of autonomous agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery. No direct mention or exploration of agentic software delivery is present. Instead, the focus is on traditional team practices and general engineering discipline, with references to conventional Scrum topics and a 2017 industry event. Penalties applied for outdated event reference and lack of relevant terminology or theme alignment.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about Scrum team professionalism, not agentic software delivery. No direct or thematic connection to autonomous agents or agentic principles. Fit is minimal and mostly incidental.",
