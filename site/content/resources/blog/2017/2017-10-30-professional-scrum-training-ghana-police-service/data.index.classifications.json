While there is detailed discussion of Scrum principles, teamwork, and organisational change, there is no explicit or substantial discussion of defining, measuring, or responding to customer outcomes, or integrating customer feedback into delivery. Most examples centre on internal change, team learning, and applying agile concepts rather than customer value creation. While concepts like 'backlog', 'feedback', and 'purpose' are discussed, they're focused on organisational improvement and team adoption, not directly on customer-focused delivery or empirically validated customer needs. There is minimal reference to customer value as a primary driver, and the practices described are not explicitly anchored in the measurable delivery of customer outcomes.",

The emphasis is strongly on the practical implementation of Scrum and professional training sessions, rather than the theoretical underpinnings or strategic measurement emphasized in OKRs.
