    This year has been relatively busy for conferences. Which is unusual since I
    usually forget until after the call for papers and wonder what's going on.
    Well, this time I got some submissions in on time. It does, however, baffle
    me which papers are selected. I always submit around 6 papers for workshops
    and talks, and always the one I would least like to present is picked.

    (Keynote) - Agile is Dead?</a>


    Getting out of my comfort zone is something that was instilled in me working
    with Adam Cogan and Steven Borg. That fear of failure that drives me to be
    that little bit better is what seems to set me apart…


    I worked for Adam Cogan when, on my first visit to Australia, he told me the
    day before that I was doing two talks at the Silverlight Code Camp; one on
    TFS and the other on SharePoint. I worked with Steven Borg through the night
    on his presentation for the ALM Forum. It has been an exciting last seven
    years since I left the FTE world behind; What's in store for me next…


    Here is a round-up of all of the 2017 conferences with links to the
    presentation that I used:


    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2zrKU13">NDC London 2017 - Agile Is Dead</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2A1XZe9">NDC Mini Copenhagen 2017 - Big Scrum: Scaling Scrum to the Enterprise</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2jOeQ0c">DevOps Vilnius 2017 (Keynote) - Agile is Dead?</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2hJG9Er">Scrum Day London 2017 - Agile is Dead: Long live DevOps</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2iHy18o">NDC Oslo 2017 - Building big Teams with Nexus</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2zYaf1N">Agile In Africa 2017 - Building Big Teams with Nexus</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2zc3N3G">Agile in Africa 2017 - Leading Agile Change</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2AmTZbs">Lean-Agile Glasgow (October 2017) - Leading Agile Change in Africa</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://nkdagility.net/2A1tCVh">Build Stuff LT 2017 - Sprint Zero and Working Software too</a></li>
    </ul>


    In between, I ran many workshops and courses in Norway, Ghana, India, USA,
    UK, Lithuania, &amp; Poland… I am finding more and more than the value in
    training vastly outweighs the value in consulting. I believe that every
    customer I leave should have more knowledge than when I arrived. If we can
    do that in a structured and fun way that leaves the majority with many more
    tools in their toolbox, then that's even better. Although I have been
    teaching a lot of Scrum classes rather than technical its that technical
    foundation in building lousy software that gives me the energy to help
    everyone else.

    That's just a few of the classes that I have already booked for 2018, and

    href="https://nkdagility.com/training">training</a> page.


    I think that 2018 is going to be more training than consulting, although now
    I have booked a bunch of training I have customers looking for consulting
    time… ho hum… that's the way it is I guess…
