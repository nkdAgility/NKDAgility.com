    The <a href="http://police.gov.gh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana
    Police Service</a> is in trouble. Over the last few last few decades each
    new Police organisation and government has tried in various ways to carry
    out some change but most changes have been ad-hoc, temporary, not robust
    enough or strategic. The old problems return to haunt new administrations
    and many police officers and the Public have lost hope.


    In order to create any lasting and permanent change, a transformation is
    required. A departure from the old to a new modern and professional way to
    provide protective services to the public and uphold the law. For a
    permanent change to happen it requires 3 things.


    <ol>
        <li>A clear vision, goal, metrics underpinned by a servant leadership style that empowers people to believe in the power of possibilities.</li>
        <li>A structured and strategic approach supported by a high performance framework to deliver results quickly.</li>
        <li>A transformation network made up of change agents who are trained and empowered to promote the transformation nationally.</li>
    </ol>


    As it stands, public confidence has been eroded to record levels. New
    management plans to change that, and not by nibbling around the edges. The
    new Inspector General of Police (IGP) is leading the charge to transform the
    service into a world class police service with radical, and much needed
    change.


    <blockquote>Only when an organisation has completely and utterly failed to
    deliver will it contemplate radical change.


    -Ken Schwaber</blockquote>


    I have been working with <a href="http://www.akaditi.com" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">Akaditi </a>and <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nana-abban-2a43b460/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener">Nana Abban</a> on the Ghana Police Service's organisational
    transformation, one of the first in the world, and I have never seen a
    clearer vision, nor a more empirical approach. The key to any transformation
    at the organisational level is leadership and vision. Even more so in a
    public sector organisation. The Ghana Police Service already have top down
    buy-in for the transformation, which is rare in any organisation. And when I
    say top down, you need to understand that not just the IGP, but his boss,
    the President of Ghana, are all bought in for change.


    <blockquote>

    <h4>VISION</h4>

    The Ghana Police Service seeks to become a world class Police Service
    capable of delivering planned, democratic, protective, and peaceful services
    up to the standards of international best practice

    <h4>MISSION</h4>

    The mission of the Police Service is to ensure crime prevention and
    detection, apprehension and prosecution of offenders, consistent with the
    expectations of Ghanaians for safe, secure and peaceful
    communities.</blockquote>


    The question has always been, how do you adopt Scrum &amp; Organisational
    Transformation in an empirical manner rather than a defined and traditional
    one. Oh the arguments that Steven Borg and I have had. A few years ago
    Scrum.org quietly released the Agility Path Guide as a way to do just that.
    It has been slowly gaining traction as more folks have had success.


    I should not need to tell you that in order to effect lasting change in an
    organisation you need a <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/organisational-change-create-path/">framework
    and not a methodology</a>. Since every organisation has its own way of doing
    things (unique people, processes, &amp; practices) that reflect in a unique
    culture, why would someone else's blueprint work for you. You need a
    framework (much like constructing anything physical) around which you can
    build your custom methodology. The Agility Path Guide introduces a
    framework, based on Scrum, to effect Professional Organisational Change.
    This framework can be used to productively and creatively deliver
    organisational change of the highest possible value.

    alt="" width="800" height="369" />


    We need the framework, and not a methodology, because every team, group, and
    department within an organisation is different. Accepting that difference,
    this framework helps us make sure that we are all at least playing the same
    game from the start. If everything is open to change we can easily end up in
    chaos or stagnation. Just like Scrum the Professional Organisational Change
    framework is closed for modification, but open to extension.


    <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12016"
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nkdagility-akaditi-ghana-police-scrum-board-800x450.jpg"
    alt="" width="800" height="450" />


    One such awesome extension that I have seen used to great effect in both
    software and non-software endeavours is the Kanban board. It provides both
    transparency and at-a-glance status to what is going on. While this is the
    board from the Organisational Transformation office the Inspector General of
    Police has both a Kanban and a Scrum board in his 'war room' which is what
    his change team and visitors gather around to discuss strategy and what
    comes next. While we maintain the core framework to enshrine empiricism in
    our process many parts of the organisation will extend that framework in
    creating and unique ways to help them solve their independent individuals
    problems.


    As you can imagine the Ghana Police Service is very hierarchical and relies
    heavily on rank to get things done. It has not had significant change in
    nearly 60 years, and they are still following the old ways. Command and
    control is the way things are done, and it is no longer working. The
    education level of officers has changed a lot in 60 years. By way of example
    the two Professional Scrum Foundations classes I ran for them this week had
    more MBA's, psychology, and other degrees than the same class in Europe or
    the US. There has been a big push, some say too much, on academic
    credentials, but it means that the workforce has changed. Command and
    control, that was designed for an uneducated work force will no longer be
    effective, and indeed works to erode moral. Command and control is a fallacy
    in the modern world and an enigma born of Taylorism and ignorance from a
    lost time.


    <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12015"
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nkdagility-akaditi-ghana-police-napolion-702x450.jpg"
    alt="" width="702" height="450" />


    Hell, the military realised that command and control was a losing strategy
    when Napoleon defeated the Persian army 300 years ago. The Ghana Police
    Service is certainly not the last to realise it as many European and US
    companies still try to use Command and Control in this way.


    In any Agile organisation management changes from a 'telling people what to
    do' role, to one of servant leadership. They change from giving instructions
    to setting goals. They stop being a planner and become a teacher, coach, and
    leader.


    Leadership has very little to do with giving instructions and barking
    commands.

      I am deeply impressed and i think many more people should have an
      opportunity to know about the transformational steps taken.

      Many more will come to appreciate the leadership style and dynamism and

      Organisational Change is a struggle and often frustrating experience. This
      is the very start of the process, and it will take time to see the fruits.
      I am confident that with focus, and commitment... And a lot of patience...
      Amazing things are going to happen...

      I am really impressed and can't agree with you  more on some few
      observations you have captured about the dealings of Ghana Police Service.
      The colonial structure which in my estimation was put in place as a way to
      keep the black man at bay is the very same structure which over the years
      GPS has carried on. All because it served the interest of all the
      successful leadership. What even struck me the more was the bit about on
      command and control. I will suggest also that this transformation agenda
      to be a success stakeholders especially personal should be given the
      opportunity to make input in the whole policy. Again the very people who
      formulated the policy should not be made to implement it to give a proper
      meaning which in effect will bring the kind of change we all desire.

      I am currently writing a post on the class that we ran, the Professional
      Scrum Foundations. One of the final, and most important exercises has the
      students create items to be used on the Organisational Change backlog.
      This is key as while leadership has their backlog, the folks that are
      doing the work on the ground know what the key issues are that will
      prevent change. 


      I invited all the students to submit more items to that backlog at any
      time.

      Martin, The post was really impressive. Was real eye-opener for me on how
      Agile practices can be implemented across varied industries.

      Emmanuel, If you look at old Ghana Empire from the 7th - 13th Century you
      will see that it covered a territory that was almost all of West Africa.
      This empire and many other African Empires could not run without a para
      military force or some type of order.


      The concept of modern day professional Policing starting with Robert Peel
      in England was to protect the rich and their property and later became an
      institution to protect the wider society from criminals. So Policing was
      originally paid for by the rich before the State took over. Of course it
      was the selfish interest of the rich that later gave us our modern day
      British Police. Police world wide is a para-military organisation
      therefore it has a command and control culture similar to that of the
      Military. It is based on a rank system to enforce a level of discipline
      across all levels of the hierarchy. 


      The concept of Policing is not new to Africa and many parts of the World
      so even before the colonialist came, Africans already had a system dating
      back to over 6000 years in Ancient Kemet now called Egypt.


      I guess with colonialism came 1. Economic exploitation through brute force
      and 2. A structure to perpetuate the exploitation. The Police was one of
      those structures. Nobody can justify colonialism and apartheid apart from
      those who started it. The process of changing our institutions has been
      slow and of course it has served the interest of the ruling elite for many
      decades however there is a change or better still a transformation
      happening in many places if we look for it. Good things are happening even
      though people might be sceptical or lost hope. 


      Occasionally in history we are fortunate or perhaps lucky to have inspired
      leaders who see the problem and want to offer solutions (fortunately the
      current IGP is one such leader). The transformation of the Ghana Police
      Service is long overdue. It is bottom up and top down with support from
      the junior ranks to senior officers, at all levels the various ranks are
      involved in the designing, developing and executing the various strategy
      and plans to transform the organisation. 


      Ghana Police Service wants to be the best in Africa and one of the top ten
      in the world within 4 years and I think we should all encourage and
      support the effort of the Inspector General of Police who is both a
      gentleman and a Servant Leader. 


      Let's give it a go and see how we can all support this opportunity for
      deep meaningful and sustainable change that will become a showcase not
      only for Africa but for the rest of the World too. 


      Thank you.


      Nana
