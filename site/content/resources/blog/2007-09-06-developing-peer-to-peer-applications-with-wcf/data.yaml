  - "<p>I recently had the need to create and deliver a presentation on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx\">Developing Peer-To-Peer Applications With WCF</a>. Although the technical content was good, my delivery was not. I got stage fright...</p>\n<p>As I approached the room to give the presentation in which I expected to see a couple of people, I was horrified to hear a clamor of voices, no, a venerable din of idle conversation coming from the room. <em>Not that room, please...</em> but that was indeed the room, and I had to give my presentation to more than 25 highly technical people...It was fortunate at least that I had a copy of all of my notes, as my mind (what little was left after a day of traveling) dribbled slowly out of my ears...</p>\n<p>I had previously <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/self.aspx/Public/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System/VSTS%20Presentation.ppt\">presented on VSTS</a>, but that was to a room of coworkers that somehow seamed less threatening. In addition I knew the content back to front and did not have any notes anyway. The 45 minute <a title=\"Visual Studio Team System\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx\">Visual Studio Team System</a> presentation ended up taking 3 hours.</p>\n<p>So, needless to say, I ended up having to almost totally read from my notes. Not the best way to do a presentation...</p>\n<p>Anyway, here it is...</p>\n<p><a title=\"http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx\" href=\"http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx\">http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx</a></p>\n<p>I owe a lot of thanks to the authors of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-WCF-Practical-Microsoft-Implementation/dp/1590597028\">Pro WCF: Practical Microsoft SOA Implementation</a> without which I would not have been able to put the presentation together in three days at all.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/.NET\" rel=\"tag\">.NET</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SOA\" rel=\"tag\">SOA</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/WCF\" rel=\"tag\">WCF</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS\" rel=\"tag\">TFS</a>\_</div>"
