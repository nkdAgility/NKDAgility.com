This shows that the community that surrounds this site it pretty honest. </p> <p>I have had plenty of time today, as I am unemployed this week, and I have managed to get through most of the submissions, well those in English anyway...</p> <p>When I get back to the grind, I am sure that I will not have as much time to spend, but I want to do this: I benefit from this community (won a prize last month) and want to give something back.</p> <p>You can view the credits I have attained by going to <a href=\"http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk\">http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk</a></p> <p>\_</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/Login/CreateMember.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up and start collecting your credit.</a> Oh, and win prizes!</p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"
