  - "<p>I was looking for an online backup solution and <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OnLosingDataAndAFamilyBackupStrategy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Hanselman</a> provided it for me: Thanks Scott and good luck with all the <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NewJobNewHouseNewBabyAndDesigningATotallyNewHomeOffice.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">new stuff</a> :).</p> <p>These days, with all of your...lets call it \"stuff\" being mostly digital. The photos of the kids, your correspondence, all your work... You need backup...</p> <p>I have been looking for a solution that does not brake the bank, but the best I could find was \"BT\" who charge and arm and a leg while probably losing your data. If the government can lose 7 million peoples personal details (du..post? How dumb can you get!) then BT can lose your backup. With Mozy being a smaller company, all be it partnered with someone bigger, loosing your data could brake them, so it is in their interest to provide the best service rather than best-effort as you would get from BT or another monolithic company that really does not care about your data, just your money...</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_2.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"152\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_thumb.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>I have only just started using <a href=\"https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG\" target=\"_blank\">Mozy Backup</a> but I think it is a winner. With 2GB of free space (which never does the job :)) it is a fantastic solution. And it is only $5 for unlimited space, Wow...</p> <p>It has a really simple setup, even my dad could work it, and just chugs away in the background. You get options (pictured above) for wither you want quicker backups or a faster computer, but with 2.5GB of data to get through I opted for the faster backup.</p> <p>And speaking of data size, did you notice that I don't have enough space for a full backup? Well if you sign up using this URL <a href=\"https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG\">https://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG</a> you get an extra 250mb, and so do I :)</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_4.png\"><img style=\"border-right: 0px;border-top: 0px;border-left: 0px;border-bottom: 0px\" height=\"152\" alt=\"image\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-MozyBackup_10C2F-image_thumb_1.png\" width=\"244\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p>Only 11 hours to go till I have a full backup :)</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      I've used Mozy for several months now and it certainly is easy to use. 
      However, I've not had occasion to call any of the files back yet.  I sure
      hope it works when I need it.  Have you tried retreiving any of your files
      yet?<br />

      I've been using Mozy online backup to access and synchronize my files on
      the computer used. It works very well for me and pretty fast too! Better
      than other online backup.
