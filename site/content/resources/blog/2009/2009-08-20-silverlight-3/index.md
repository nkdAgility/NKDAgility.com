[![](images/Silverlight3_CB9C-Silverlight3Wrox_-2-2.jpg)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470385405?ie=UTF8&tag=dyslexicdev-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470385405)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=marthinssblog-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0470385405) Over the past week I have been reading the new book [Silverlight 3 Programmer's Reference](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470385405?ie=UTF8&tag=dyslexicdev-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470385405)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=dyslexicdev-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0470385405)from Wrox and I have found it one of the best books on Silverlight I have seen in a good while. It is concise without being boring and it provides a wealth of information on Silverlight 3.

And it is in Colour! I never would have thought that this would make such a difference, I don’t really know why I thought this as I hate looking at code in notepad, but it makes it much easier to read the code pages, both c#/vb and xaml.

Because I have been using WPF for a number of years this book is perfect for me, although this is a reference book, It has a nice layout that is conducive to both learning and reference.

Will I be hanging up my WPF hat and replacing it with a Silverlight one? Well, no… but Silverlight 3 is a big step forward…
