For my wife’s birthday my brother and his wife bought us a professional photo shoot, and the photographer got some [fantastic shots](http://perfectexpressions.co.uk/blog/2009/05/the-hinshelwood-family-portrait-shoot/). I love the one of my daughter jumping. We have had a couple of go’s at this before, but we have always been disappointed in both the photographer and the results.

John Johnston at [Perfect Expressions](http://www.perfectexpressions.co.uk) was fantastic, he was patient with the kids, and that takes a lot with my daughter, I think the [shots](http://perfectexpressions.co.uk/blog/2009/05/the-hinshelwood-family-portrait-shoot/) speak for themselves. Looking forward to seeing the rest…
