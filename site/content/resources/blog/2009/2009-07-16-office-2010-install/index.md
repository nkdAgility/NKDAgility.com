Now I have [uninstalled Office 2007 32bit](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2009/07/16/installing-office-2010-gotcha-1.aspx) I am ready to get this 2010 thing going…

I am installing on Vista 64, I know, but I cant get Windows 7 in the office yet…

I always do a full install, coz I really hate not having that feature that you need that you did not know that you need ;)

Now, although I am not using very much of the resources on my computer, the install seems to be making it relatively unresponsive.

Not a big deal, but Visual Studio can be unresponsive anyway…so…where did all my productivity go :(
