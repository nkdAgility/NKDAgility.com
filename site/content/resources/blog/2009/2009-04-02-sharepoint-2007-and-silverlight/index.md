I have looked at this topic before but I just got my hands on a new Wrox book called “[Professional Microsoft Sharepoint 2007 Development using Microsoft Silverlight 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0470434007?ie=UTF8&tag=marthinssblog-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0470434007)”, phew, could that title be any longer!

At only £16 pounds don't expect a 1000 pager, but at just under 300 pages the content is good. It is pretty heavy on code with endless pages of it, but even if you take them out, there is some good content in there. If you have figured out how to deploy Silverlight to Sharepoint then I can’t promise you will learn anything, but if this is your first outing, I think you will find some useful ideas and methods.

The book takes you through all of the essentials, creating Custom Field types, Branding and custom web parts with Silverlight along with data interaction to produce a slick little training site. There are even some bits on deploying solutions and debugging against Sharepoint. Not bad for the price…
