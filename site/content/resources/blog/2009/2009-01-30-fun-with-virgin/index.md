We are getting a new carpet tomorrow… my wife is 8 and a half months pregnant and she’s nesting…

So we cleared the living room and cut up the carpet to dispose of (the carpet fitters charge £25 to get rid of the old carpet, and my wife decided that that was too much…you can’t ague with a pregnant woman.)

Well, with the TV in the back room and the Virgin+ box in the front, I though I could just bring down my daughters 15” pink LCD and connect it up…

No picture! Dough… its set for HDMI and the hardware manufacturer in there infinite wisdom has decided that when the HDMI is active SCART is disabled. Not this poses some problems with some TV’s that are slow to respond, but is positively disastrous when you now only have SCART .

How did I solve this conundrum you ask! The same way I always do and whipped out Google… for which I had to scramble over to the back of the now overly crowded back room to retrieve my laptop.

What you nee to do is this:

Press reset on the box and hold down play and stop on the front of the box until it says boot the little screen. After a couple of minutes it will say “1nput” in a digital watch kinda way. Use the fast forward (>>) button on the front of the box to select “5d” and then press OK. Now reset your box again and you should have a picture….
