Well, that's me well and truly back from my holidays, a nice relaxing couple of weeks spent at home with my family.

As a kind of New Years present, Microsoft has released a free learning initiative for those of you that are or will be using Visual Studio 2008. I am taking it myself as a way to make sure that I have not missed anything :)
