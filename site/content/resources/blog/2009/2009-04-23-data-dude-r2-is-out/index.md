Coming hot on the heals of Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR is the [Visual Studio Team System 2008 Database Edition GDR R2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) which features some new bits and better support for SQL 2008.

You can get a full description over at the [Microsoft Download site](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en), but this new version of [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) has a number of feature enhancements and bug fixes included in the release…

If you are an avid [Data Dude](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb3ad767-5f69-4db9-b1c9-8f55759846ed&displaylang=en) user then you will need no encouragement to update, but if you are not and you do any sort of database development then you should take a look, as even with the substantial learning or conversion curve, it will provide the sort of benefits that only .NET code developers have had in the past along with a few other enhancements just for you…

Have you ever wanted to be able to deploy a new version of your database from a USB memory stick and have it automatically produce a differencing script and run it against the target :)
