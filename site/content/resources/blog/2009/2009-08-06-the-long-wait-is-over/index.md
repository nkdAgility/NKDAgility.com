Have you been waiting for a long time for [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/)? Well I have.. I have been able to use Beta 1 and the RC for a good while now, and it surprised me that the Windows 7 Beta 1 was more stable, responsive and cleaner than Vista was after Service Pack 3.

Today (06/08/2009) [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) RTM will be available for Developers on MSDN and a lovely free copy for those that participated in the invitation only Beta program.

![](images/hazmat.jpg)What a joy this day is, we finally get an OS that is both up to date and that we can use… I was nearly ready to hang up my PC and buy a MAC. Well, when I say NEARLY I really mean as far away as possible with a hazmat suit on, but you get the idea. Those of you that use Vista and like it, at least over the aging XP will love [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/). It is what Windows Vista should have been but wasn’t.

If you have not yet seen [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) then head on over to the [Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) site, if you have then it will not be long until it is available. September will be the official “buy it in the shops” day, but many new PC’s already come with an automatic upgrade.
