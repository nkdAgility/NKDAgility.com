Its that time again and you should all be in Glasgow on the 2nd May for [Developer Day Scotland 2](http://developerdayscotland.com). There are some excellent speakers, some we saw last time and some new.

[Colin Mackay](http://blog.colinmackay.net/archive/2009/03/21/Update.aspx) hosted an amazing event last time, and I expect this year to be at least as good…
