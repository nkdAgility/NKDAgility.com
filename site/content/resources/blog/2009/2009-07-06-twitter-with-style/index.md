I have been using an excellent piece of software for twittering form my Windows Mobile. [Twikini](http://www.trinketsoftware.com/Twikini) has all of the features you would expect, as well as working fantastically with the IPhone like features of Windows Mobile 6.5.

I had used a few of the other apps that are available, but I think this is the best for the way that I use Twitter. The only thing that I have had a problem with is that on my phone keyboard between the “r” and the “t” is the hotkey for “Tweet”, and I quite often send in an unfinished tweet. Really a phone issue, but could do with an optional “confirm tweet” checkbox.

Ahh well, can’t have everything…
