The Windows 7 Release Candidate will be available next week for Developers on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/default.aspx). It is currently up on Connect for [Windows 7 Beta Program](https://connect.microsoft.com/windows7) participants and should be [publically available from the 5th May](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2009/04/24/windows-7-release-candidate-update.aspx). You can find out more at the [Windows Team Blog](http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/default.aspx).

I feel a couple of reinstalls coming on :)

I have not installed it myself yet, that is a task for the weekend, but you visit “[Windows 7 Release Candidate 1 impressions, insights, and expectations](http://www.engadget.com/2009/04/30/windows-7-release-candidate-1-impressions-insights-and-expecta/)” for more information.
