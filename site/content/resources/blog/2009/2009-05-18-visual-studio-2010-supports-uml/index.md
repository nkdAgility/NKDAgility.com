![VS-TS_rgb_thumb[2][5][5][5][5]](images/VisualStudio2010SupportsUML_EC8C-VS-TS_rgb_thumb25555_-3-3.png)Just in case you have been living in a shed at the bottom of the garden, Visual Studio 2010 is to support UML. As you can see from my diagram, my UML skills are a little, erm, crude. But I think you will get the picture and if you want to do better then just download [Visual Studio 2010 on Wednesday](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-gb/products/2010/default.mspx) if you are not an MSDN subscribe, and if you are… well you can get it today :)

As I have not used UML since university so I do not know if this feature will meet the needs of those that use UML extensively, but I would expect that a lot of time and investment has gone into this area, and if it is lacking in some minor but crucial feature, there is still time to get some changes made…maybe...
