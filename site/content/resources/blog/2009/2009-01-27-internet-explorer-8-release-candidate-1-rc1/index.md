Yesterday Microsoft released the latest version of it new IE8 browser. As an avid user of both Beta 1 and Beta 2 I am looking forward to seeing the result. A CR should have most if not all of the performance improvements that will end up in the final release, so I hope all of the small problems that I had with the beta are fixed…
