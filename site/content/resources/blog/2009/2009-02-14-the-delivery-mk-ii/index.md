If you remember 19 months ago when my daughter was born my wife has a [very quick delivery](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/25/The-Delivery.aspx), 45 minutes to be precise. Well it was quicker this time. She went into labour at 11:55am and my son was born at 12:01pm :) Luckily we were already at the hospital for an induction as my wife had been in distress for some weeks…

Kaiden is getting on well with his sister, but she does keep trying to shove his “Nonie” (my daughters name for a Dummy/pacifier) in his face wither he wants it or not.
