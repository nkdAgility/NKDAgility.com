    <p class="lead">Our client is using a brand new shiny installation of
    SharePoint 2010, so now we need to integrate SharePoint 2010 our upgraded
    Team Foundation Server 2010 instance into it.</p>

    <p>In order to do that you need to run the Team Foundation Server 2010
    install on the SharePoint 2010 server and choose to install only the
    “Extensions for SharePoint Products and Technologies”. We want out <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/05/03/upgrading-team-foundation-server-2008-to-2010.aspx">upgraded
    Team Project Collection</a> to create any new portal in this SharePoint 2010
    server farm.</p>

    <ul>

    SharePoint 2013 with Team Foundation Server 2012</a></li>

    <li><span class="label label-important">Update 4th May 2010</span> -&nbsp;<a
    href="http://lightspeedit.com.au" rel="nofollow">Nilesh Deshpande</a> from
    LightSpeedIT in Sydney was asking how he configures SharePoint integration
    when he has TFS installed on Windows 7. The answer is easy, if not one he
    will like. You can’t. When you install on Windows 7 you can only do a basic
    install and the Admin options you would need to configure SharePoint are not
    available. You will need to move you ProjectCollection to a TFS instance
    running on a Server OS to be able to do this.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>There a number of goodies above and beyond a solution file that requires
    the install, with the main one being the TFS2010 client API. These goodies
    allow proper integration with the creation and viewing of Work Items from
    SharePoint a new feature with TFS 2010. This works in both SharePoint 2007
    and SharePoint 2010 with the level of integration dependant on the version
    of SharePoint that you are running. There are three levels of integration
    with “SharePoint Services 3.0” or “SharePoint Foundation 2010” being the
    lowest. This level only offers reporting services framed integration for
    reporting along with Work Item Integration and document management. The
    highest is Microsoft Office SharePoint Services (MOSS) Enterprise with Excel
    Services integration providing some lovely dashboards.</p>

    alt="image" width="789" height="642" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Dashboards take the guessing out of Project Planning and estimation. Plus
    writing these reports would be boring!</strong></p>

    <p>The Extensions that you need are on the same installation media as the
    main TFS install and the only difference is the options you pick during the
    install.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"

    alt="image11" width="800" height="614" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Installing the TFS 2010 Extensions for SharePoint Products and Technologies
    onto SharePoint 2010</strong></p>

    <p>Annoyingly you may need to reboot a couple of times, but on this server
    the process was MUCH smother than on our internal server. I think this was
    mostly to do with this being a clean install.</p>

    <p>Once it is installed you need to run the configuration. This will add all
    of the Solution and Templates that are needed for SharePoint to work
    properly with TFS.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"

    alt="image14" width="800" height="602" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    This is where all the TFS 2010 goodies are added to your SharePoint 2010
    server and the TFS 2010 object model is installed.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;<img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image17_4148c1fc-4e0f-4f3e-a0ee-ed950204cffb.png"
    alt="image17" width="799" height="604" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    All done, you have everything installed, but you still need to configure
    it</strong></p>

    <p>Now that we have the TFS 2010 SharePoint Extensions installed on our
    SharePoint 2010 server we need to configure them both so that they will talk
    happily to each other. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

    <h3 class="icon-task">Configuring the SharePoint 2010 Managed path for Team
    Foundation Server 2010</h3>

    <p>In order for TFS to automatically create your project portals you need a
    wildcard managed path setup. This is where TFS will create the portal during
    the creation of a new Team project. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>To find the managed paths page for any application you need to first
    select the “Managed web applications”&nbsp; link from the SharePoint 2010
    Central Administration screen.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_1b6e5541-c9d0-4036-ba3f-d0353fa7d69e.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="529" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Find the “Manage web applications” link under the “Application Management”
    section.</strong></p>

    <p>On you are there you will see that the “Managed Paths” are there, they
    are just greyed out and selecting one of the applications will enable it to
    be clicked.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_f2e33e63-50b9-4da5-bf50-76d6e4e0ee13.png"
    alt="image" width="551" height="371" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    You need to select an application for the SharePoint 2010 ribbon to
    activate.</strong></p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_a6255220-0e2d-4e2b-a763-cd0c00340951.png"
    alt="image" width="577" height="367" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    You need to select an application before you can get to the Managed Paths
    for that application.</strong></p>

    <p>Now we need to add a managed path for TFS 2010 to create its portals
    under. I have gone for the obvious option of just calling the managed path
    “TFS02” as the TFS 2010 server is the second TFS server that the client has
    installed, TFS 2008 being the first. This links the location to the server
    name, and as you can’t have two projects of the same name in two separate
    project collections there is unlikely to be any conflicts.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_8e9d3fb4-251f-489d-8efd-0048670c5846.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="562" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Add a “tfs02” wildcard inclusion path to your SharePoint site. <br />
    </strong><br /> &nbsp;</p>

    <h3 class="icon-task">Configure the Team Foundation Server 2010 connection
    to SharePoint 2010</h3>

    <p>In order to have you new TFS 2010 Server talk to and create sites in
    SharePoint 2010 you need to tell the TFS server where to put them. As this
    TFS 2010 server was installed in out-of-the-box mode it has a SharePoint
    Services 3.0 (the free one) server running on the same box. But we want to
    change that so we can use the external SharePoint 2010 instance. Just open
    the “Team Foundation Server Administration Console” and navigate to the
    “SharePoint Web Applications” section. Here you click “Add” and enter the
    details for the Managed path we just created.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_5d0320fe-f29e-4374-88c9-eae8823a0d51.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="570" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure: If
    you have special permissions on your SharePoint you may need to add accounts
    to the “Service Accounts” section.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Before we can se this new SharePoint 2010 instance to be the default for
    our upgraded Team Project Collection we need to configure SharePoint to take
    instructions from our TFS server.</p>

    <h3 class="icon-task">Configure SharePoint 2010 to connect to Team
    Foundation Server 2010</h3>

    <p>On your SharePoint 2010 server open the Team Foundation Server
    Administration Console and select the “Extensions for SharePoint Products
    and Technologies” node. Here we need to “grant access” for our TFS 2010
    server to create sites. Click the “Grant access” link and&nbsp; fill out the
    full URL to the&nbsp; TFS server, for example <a
    href="http://servername.domain.com:8080/tfs">http://servername.domain.com:8080/tfs</a>,
    and if need be restrict the path that TFS sites can be created on. Remember
    that when the users create a new team project they can change the default
    and point it anywhere they like as long as it is an authorised SharePoint
    location.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_74b63d15-78fe-4479-8d86-f5a27ecabc2e.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="530" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Grant access for your TFS 2010 server to create sites in SharePoint
    2010</strong> <br /> &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Now that we have an authorised location for our team project portals to
    be created we need to tell our Team Project Collection that this is where it
    should stick sites by default for any new Team Projects created.</p>

    <h3 class="icon-task">Configure the Team Foundation Server 2010 Team Project
    Collection to create new sites in SharePoint 2010</h3>

    <p>Back on out TFS 2010 server we need to setup the defaults for our
    upgraded Team Project Collection to the new SharePoint 2010 integration we
    have just set up. On the TFS 2010 server open up the “Team Foundation Server
    Administration Console” again and navigate to the “Team Project Collections”
    node. Once you are there you will see a list of all of your TPC’s and in our
    case we have a DefaultCollection as well as out named and Upgraded
    collection for TFS 2008.</p>

    <p>If you select the “SharePoint Site” tab we can see that it is not
    currently configured.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_bc3d6930-dffc-4104-a7e4-41e1b151bc72.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="567" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Our new Upgrade TFS2008 Team Project Collection does not have SharePoint
    configured</strong></p>

    <p>Select to “Edit Default Site Location” and select the new integration
    point that we just set up for SharePoint 2010. Once you have selected the
    “SharePoint Web Application” (the thing we just configured) then it will
    give you an example based on that configuration point and the name of the
    Team Project Collection that we are configuring. <br /> &nbsp;</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_fec63e96-ef5a-4202-b661-dd6b737d7c9f.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="567" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Set the default location for new Team Project Portals to be created for this
    Team Project Collection</strong></p>

    <p>This is where the reason for configuring the Extensions on the SharePoint
    2010 server before doing this last bit becomes apparent. TFS 2010 is going
    to create a site at our <a
    href="http://sharepointserver/tfs02/">http://sharepointserver/tfs02/</a>
    location called <a
    href="http://sharepointserver/tfs02/[TeamProjectCollection">http://sharepointserver/tfs02/[TeamProjectCollection</a>],
    or whatever we had specified, and it would have had difficulty doing this if
    we had not given it permission first.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_a03288d3-8655-42c8-b58f-785c8f4524c8.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="568" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure: If
    there is no Team Project Collection site at this location the TFS 2010
    server is going to create one</strong></p>

    <p>This will create a nice Team Project Collection parent site to contain
    the Portals for any new Team Projects that are created. It is with noting
    that it will not create portals for existing Team Projects as this process
    is run during the Team Project Creation wizard.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-IntegrateSharePoint2010withTeamFoundatio_A557-image_328c1980-64dc-4d15-b043-f20508b3d1e4.png"
    alt="image" width="800" height="512" border="0" /> <br /> <strong>Figure:
    Just a basic parent site to host all of your new Team Project Portals as sub
    sites</strong></p>

    <p>You will need to add all of the users that will be creating Team Projects
    to be Administrators of this site so that they will not get an error during
    the Project Creation Wizard. You may also want to customise this as a proper
    portal to your projects if you are going to be having lots of them, but it
    is really just a default placeholder so you have a top level site that you
    can backup and point at.</p>

    <p><strong>You have now integrated SharePoint 2010 and team Foundation
    Server 2010!</strong></p>

    <p>You can now go forth and multiple your Team Projects for this Team
    Project Collection or you can continue to add portals to your other
    Collections.</p>

      Martin,<br /><br />I installed Sharepoint 2010 and TFS 2010 on a Windows 7
      Ultimate (x64).<br /><br />I'm unable to get Team Project automatically
      create sharepoint portal in this configration.<br /><br />I've tried
      enabling Project Portal setting from VSTS &gt; Team &gt; Project Portal
      Settings menu, however "Use this Sharepoint Site:" radio button is
      disabled.<br /><br />Also, TFS Administration tool does not show
      Sharepoint Web Applications node (I guess reason being host OS is Windows
      7).<br /><br />Any help is appreciated.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />

      I assume this was the Sharepoint 2010 beta that's currently publicly
      available?  If so, does that mean that features like Excel Services that
      are required for the extended dashboards and reporting in SharePoint 2007
      are included in the public beta?

      Ryan,<br /><br /> This is the RTM of SharePoint 2010 as it RTM’ed at the
      same time as Office 2010.<br /><br /> No, the dashboards and reports are
      not included in SP2010 as they are added during the install of the
      “Sharepoint Extensions” part of the TFS 2010 Installer.<br /><br

      Thanks for the great post. But unfortunately I got one error when the TFS
      admin console tries to create the SharePoint site for the team project
      collection, saying "TF249033: The site template is not available for the
      locale identifier (LCID). The site template name is: STS#0. The LCID is:
      1033".<br />That's probably because we have a german SharePoint
      installation. Any idea, how to solve this?

      I found a solution for the problem with the LCID (TF249033).<br /><br
      />Just install the Language Packs is the version of your sharepoint (year
      and SERVER or FOUNDATION SERVICE) and in the language corresponding of TFS
      (look on the internet to find the language appropriate to the number of
      the folder which arise problem).

      Integration of TFS 2010 andSharePoint 2010 went fine until I had to
      configure TFS Reporting (TFS Admin Console-&gt;Reporting). In Edit
      Reporting dialog, Reports tab, I get error "“This operation is not
      supported on a report server that is configured to run in SharePoint
      integrated mode.”. My Reporting Services are configured in SharePoint
      integrated mode. Is it possible to configure TFS Reporting-Reports to work
      when you have Reporting Services in SharePoint integrated mode?

      I found my solution with http://www.asphostportal.com. Our company trust
      them to host our sharepoint 2010 site. You can try them. They offer
      sharepoint 2010 with under $10.00/month. Everything looks great...

      Very nice step by step guide, thank you very much.<br />I just have a
      problem to create sharepoint site with the VSTS wizard. I ve get the

      the team project portal. The following error occurred : TF250021: A

      I am trying to find a comparsion of what TFS dashboards we would get when
      integrating with SP 2010 Standard vs SP 2010 Enterprise but have not been
      able to find anything specific. Do you know where i might be able to find
      this information? I need to confince some people that the Enterprise
      version is worth the extra money.

      I've been absolutely baffled by the Microsoft documentation for all this -
      information overload! Thank you for very clear set of instructions and

      I'm new to Sharepoint but worked little bit on SharePoint 2010. May I know
      if TFS Search can be implemented on remote SharePoint 2010 server or both
      SharePoint and TFS on the same machine? If you have any links or guide
      will be highly appreaciated.

      I do not really understand the question as I do not know what "TFS Search"
      is. What is the result you are trying to achieve?

      May I ask a question on this older article?  I already see the window
      depicting a basic parent site, which was the target of this discussion. 
      So the person I replaced at this job already implemented the procedures we
      see here.  Now I just want to somehow populate that site with all of the
      TFS Work items, by project, on that page.  How do I do this?  I have
      little SharePoint admin knowledge but a big enough brain to understand
      whatever you folks can tell me.  Thanks, Chris
