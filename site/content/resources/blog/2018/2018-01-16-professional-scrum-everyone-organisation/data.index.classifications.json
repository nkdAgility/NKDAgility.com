The dominant narrative is explicitly Scrum-focused, centred around Scrum artifacts, events, roles, and agile transformation training—not clearly connected to or referencing the distinct OKR framework. Thus, although there is conceptual resonance in themes like outcome-driven agility, organisational alignment, transparency, and iterative improvement—key OKR-like ideas—it does not articulate these in an OKR framework or align explicitly with OKR principles. Hence, mention and depth are low, conceptual alignment and intent are moderate due to underlying shared agile themes, while audience alignment and signal-to-noise ratio are relatively high because the audience overlap and content focus on organisational agility overlaps strongly with potential OKR adopters.
