    "reasoning": "The content does not explicitly mention 'Agentic Engineering' or directly reference agency as a philosophical or systemic design principle. However, it conceptually overlaps through its focus on continuous delivery, team autonomy, empirical feedback, and practices promoting developer agency—such as CD, TDD, feature toggles, and flow. It covers how teams can be more responsive, autonomous, and focused on fast, empirical feedback (core aspects of agency), and discusses practices that maximize a team's ability to adapt (conceptual fit). The depth is moderate—focused mainly on optimizing flow across Sprints and supporting engineering practices, without a wider lens on the interplay between human/AI agency or systemic ethical frameworks. The audience (Scrum professionals, engineers, agilists) is strongly aligned. Signal-to-noise is high, but the philosophical/ethical dimensions of Agentic Engineering are largely absent.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article closely aligns with Agentic Engineering through its emphasis on team autonomy, empirical feedback, and advanced engineering practices, although it never explicitly discusses agency and omits ethical or AI collaboration considerations. Its fit is mainly conceptual and practical, not by explicit categorization.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on advanced Scrum practices, continuous delivery, and flow across Sprint boundaries, referencing Kanban and engineering techniques like feature toggles and TDD. However, there is no mention or clear discussion of AI, autonomous agents, or agentic principles. The depth and alignment moderately overlap with foundational engineering disciplines required for agentic delivery but never actually address the core category (agentic systems, AI agency, human-AI collaboration, contextual intelligence, or governance frameworks for agents). The audience (Scrum practitioners) would overlap somewhat with those targeted by the Agentic Software Delivery category, but all themes strictly remain within traditional Agile/CD/DevOps boundaries.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Focused on Scrum, flow, and CD, with no discussion of agents, AI, or agentic principles. High relevance to Agile practitioners, but only partial and incidental alignment with Agentic Software Delivery.",
