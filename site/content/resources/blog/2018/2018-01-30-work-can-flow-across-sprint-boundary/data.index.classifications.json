However, it focuses predominantly on Scrum practices and techniques rather than on enduring capabilities as defined in the Capability category. It mentions aspects that relate to continuous delivery and transparency but lacks a deeper exploration of the competencies needed to sustain these practices over time or how they become embedded in organizational culture. Overall, while there are elements that touch upon capabilities, they are secondary to the emphasis on specific Scrum roles and techniques.",
