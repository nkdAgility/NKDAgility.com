  - "<p class=\"lead\">Did you know that the DOD has made it illegal to do waterfall? Well, kind of... For the first time in many years, the Department of Defence (DOD) in the United States had made a major update to its procurement rules. They can no longer be held accountable for holding up our industry, and being culpable for its inability to move towards agility. The last vestiges of the old ways are gone.</p>\n\n<h2>TL;DR;</h2>\n\nThe benefits of working in an iterative agile process are now painfully obvious to both the FBI as a result of Sentinel and partly as a result to the US DOD.\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Higher success rate</strong> – you are three times more likely to be successful with agile</li>\n    <li><strong>Cost Effective</strong> – As you always have working software you can stop at any time without waste</li>\n    <li><strong>Low Risk</strong> – You only ever have one short iteration of risk at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn the UK we have government-wide lean-agile initiatives that are producing awesome results already and in the USA lean-agile has effectively become the law.\n\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Deliver Early and Often</strong> - This principle is aimed at changing the culture from one that is focused typically on a single delivery to a new model that comprises multiple deliveries to establish an environment that supports deployed capabilities every 12 to 18 months.</li>\n    <li><strong>Incremental and Iterative Development and Testing</strong> - This principle embraces the concept that incremental and iterative development and testing, including the use of prototyping, yield better outcomes than trying to deploy large complex IT network systems in one \"Big Bang.\"</li>\n    <li><strong>Rationalized Requirements</strong> - User involvement is critical to the ultimate success of any IT implementation, and user needs must be met. However, this principle also recognizes the need for users and requirements developers to embrace an enterprise focus across a portfolio of capabilities with established standards and open modular platforms vice customized solutions to ensure interoperability and seamless integration.</li>\n    <li><strong>Flexible/Tailored Processes</strong> - The Department's IT needs range from modernizing nuclear command and control systems to updating word processing systems on office computers. This principle acknowledges unique types of IT acquisition and embraces flexible and tailored-and risk-appropriate-IT paths based on the characteristics of the proposed IT acquisition.</li>\n</ul>\n<small><a href=\"http://www.afei.org/WorkingGroups/section804tf/Documents/OSD_Sec_804_Report.pdf\">A new approach for delivering Information Technology capabilities in the Department of Defence</a></small></blockquote>\n\nSo with the radical change in approach from two western governments, these positive messages should filter down through anyone who does business with them. The tides are changing…\n\n<h2>The changing state of agility in defence</h2>\n\nYou may be thinking “But who gives a crap what the DOD does?”. In the USA the Department of Defence employs over 1.2 million people, and that's not counting contractors. This means that, unfortunately,\_ everything in IT revolves around how the DOD develop software and work with vendors. If you are a vendor that works even third-hand with the DOD you used to be bound by law (the DOD procurement rules) to create software and work in a stage-gated and distinctly waterfall manner. Oh, many teams tried to do agile anyway. However they could only do this within each stage and this is the situation and source of Scrumfall, Agilefall, WaterScrumFall and all of the other \"pretending to be agile\" processes out there.\n\nThe DOD has influenced Universities by requiring that they create engineers that work within their model and by providing and creating jobs that function this way. How can one learn to be agile in a world governed by waterfall. Indeed our own Ministry of Defence (MOD) has had the same influence, maybe from their own rules but also as a result of working with the Americans and within their rules; like how airports in Europe require you to take your shoes off or go through those big scanners even though you are not flying to the USA.\n\n<blockquote>(2) be designed to include—\n\n(A) early and continual involvement of the user;\n\n(B) multiple, rapidly executed increments or releases of capability;\n\n(C) early, successive prototyping to support an evolutionary approach; and\n\n(D) a modular, open-systems approach.\n\n<small><a href=\"http://www.afei.org/news/Documents/2010%20NDAA%20Section%20804.pdf\">804: Implementation of new acquisition process for information technology systems</a></small></blockquote>\n\nWith the new rules, there is now freedom to deliver more frequently and iteratively throughout the western world and this effect can be seen in recent UK projects as well as in the US.\_ There is no better government site than <a href=\"http://gov.uk\">http://gov.uk</a>! It is quickly becoming the envy of other governments in its simplicity and ones ability to quickly and easily find the information you need.\n\nOne of the defining projects of the last 10 years that has resulted in this change in the USA was the resounding and public failure of the Sentinel project buy the FBI.\n\n<h2>The impact of the Sentinal project failure, and success</h2>\n\nI created this presentation based on work that I have done with Scrum.org and I use it at organisations that have a little more inflexibility and stubbornness than most. Usually, at these customers I hear phrases like “You cant do that here.” and “We are not a software company.” Thus looking at the FBI is a good one as it is not software and government. If the government can do agile then by golly everyone can.\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image2.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb2.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nI always like to start a presentation by looking at some data. For good reasons have we moved to agility from waterfall and above you can see that as of 2011 we are three times as likely to succeed doing agile as we were under a waterfall.\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Succeed</strong> – Project was on time and on budget</li>\n    <li><strong>Challenged</strong> – Project was delivered but not on time or on budget</li>\n    <li><strong>Failed</strong> – Project was not delivered</li>\n</ul>\n\nAlthough we still have a lot of challenged projects we can vastly reduce the failure of them. In addition one would hope that an agile project that fails, fails only a few short iterations into the project so the costs are a lot less. Waterfall projects tend to fail near the end as it is not clear what will be delivered, or not delivered until at least testing commences.\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image3.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb3.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nCan you imagine a green screen terminal application delivered in 1995? Just to put it in perspective, Windows 95 was available. Hell, my Atari has a graphical UI. Well the FBI launched their obsolete criminal records system in1995 and used technology that was museum quality at launch. This is all to common with projects that take many years to complete and even more so on government projects.\n\nSo what happened next?\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image4.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb4.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nAt first all was well and the FBI Director commissioned a 3 year project with a budget of $390 million but very quickly things start to drift and he had to go, cap in hand, to congress and ask for more money. As this is typical government fair he obviously got it but in 2005 there was still nothing delivered. Not a single piece of working functionality existed after 4 years and an extra $170 mullion. How would your boss react if you had nothing to show for 4 weeks… let alone 4 years?\n\nWould you still have a job?\n\nIn this case obviously the best idea would be to throw away the last 4 years work and start again with a new vendor. Yes… that’s it…now we can really deliver.\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image5.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb5.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nObviously having already spent over $400 million on vaporware the new vendor just needs more time and more money. It obviously also makes sense to pick not only a large defence contractor, co they have a good record of delivering high quality on time and budget, but also not a software company. The rational for this I do not know but that is just what the FBI did. However after 4 years not even a third of the work was complete and almost 90% of the budget had been spent. Indeed rough estimates to complete the project was another 6 years (10 years total) and another $351million (grand total of $772 million.)\n\nSo with over 400 people working on the project the total waste so far is over $700 million and the project is 9 years in. Remember that the out-of-date green screen terminal application has now been in place for 15 years and Windows 7 is just around the corner. We already have the iPhone and iPad so what the hell are these muppets playing at! Its time for a different tack…\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image6.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb6.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nThe new tack was an agile one and for these guys it was more of a jibe. They created a Scrum Studio in the basement of the hover building and found the 40 best folks that they could to run with the new format. This being the second reset with so many years and dollars under it there needed to be results and quick. Not only did they deliver incrementally but they were code complete with only one year of work and $30 million spent. That’s right… I am not missing a zero.\n\nUnfortunately the project had taken so long that the hardware that had been bought by the previous attempts was vastly out-dated and needed to be replaced as obsolete.\n\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image7.png\"><img style=\"border-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/image_thumb7.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nIn early 2012 the FBI shipped to production on the new refreshed hardware and saw significant improvements for a much lower cost.\n\n&nbsp;"

      Having working as a contractor for DOD. The methodology was the the single
      reason for project failure nor was it the major reason. You agile folks
      need to stop making it seem like agile is the cure-all pill for SW
      development. To be honest greedy contracting firms milking and system and
      the use it or lose it budgeting scheme that our government operates by are
      the major reasons that project fails and run way over schedule. If you
      actually do some research, agile and waterfall produce the exact same
      quality results given the same people.

      Unfortunately lean-agile is not a process to be implemented but a change
      in the mindsets and understanding of the people involved in the process.
      If you look at the research, quoted above, you will find that agile
      projects are 3 times more likely to succeed than waterfall. Does that mean
      that it is a silver bullet? Hell no... 9% of agile projects still fail and
      49% are challenged (not on time, or budget)... there is no single solution
      for software delivery but ALL projects are more likely to success with
      lean-agile processes and thinking. 


      If you want the maths then read "The Principles of Product Development
      Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development".

      You mention: 



      "If you actually do some research, agile and waterfall produce the exact
      same quality results given the same people."



      Do you have any links to research that has these conclusions?

      As I said above, if you actually do some research, agile and waterfall
      produce the exact same QUALITY (as measured by the number of defects)
      results given the same people. ACM Library has a bunch of scholarly
      article that will prove my point.

      you mind providing links for the research that you have already done to

      Measuring quality with a single metric is pretty crude. What about the
      performance, usability, stability, time to market, mean time to resolution
      of bugs (even if there were the same amount of bugs, which methodology
      would get bug fixes out faster?), and on, and on. Methodology alone will
      not result in an increase in your quality metric; however, pair that with
      good engineering practices and a short release cadence to increase that
      quality bar. Waterfall does not precludes good engineering practices, but
      it does preclude a short release cadence.

      "greedy contracting firms milking and system"


      ...except Agile can prevent exactly that. Anyone that milks the system
      will be quickly discovered when they don't deliver user-visible features
      within an iteration or two. Under waterfall, they could go months or
      possibly years without getting caught.

      With respect... I would say this is an incomplete counter-point

      1 - The methodologies could easily be seen as generating nearly the same
      potential defects. Agile doen't make one understand how to code or
      orchestrate any better; rather it makes the breadth of work more
      consumable but all stakeholders - mainly due to immediacy of information
      and ability to for a buyer to talk directly to the develop and exchange
      ideas.

      2 - Bug hunting and bashing in agile has one distinct advantage over
      waterfall - the backlog is concretely assigned and dealt with, not just
      dumped to some undefined process step later in the work schedule.

      Sticking points exist in agile - these are two conspicuous ones from my
      experience

      1 - Companies (at least mine and my co-prime) love to say "we're going
      agile at 5pm today" and don't do any sort of roll-out of what that means
      to them (yes, it's a slight exageration of the reality). I think this
      muddies any real comparision of challenge v fail (success) metrics.

      2 - I have issues with sprint bundown charts. In my mind, each sprint's
      ideal:actual variance doesn't portray a real picture but it's the simplest
      agile chart and is highly consumable by stakeholders in/out of the scrum.
      Far too often, while the sprint is being processed, I have to tell my
      management "don't read so much into the separation"

      Question: Where is it stated that Waterfall methodology is illegal? I read
      the document you linked to, and it is from 2010, and not on a government
      site. The original document refers to the government needing to come up
      with additional documents to detail the one single page in that doc. That
      doc is three years old and basically asking for more precise
      recomendations to be put forth...


      I had wanted to reference this within my org, and now I am doubting the
      source of this articles title.

      While the title may be a little sensational my understanding of the
      related documents represents a fundamental shift in the US DOD procurement
      rules. While this in-itself is not a 'law', if your organisation agrees to
      deliver software to the DOD them you must comply with the procurement
      rules.


      The documents linked to above reference US government documents and you
      should work with a procurement and contract specialist, which I am not, in
      order to really get to grips with the minutia. 


      I based my article on an article by Jeff Sutherland who has a fantastic
      update on the result of the above in 2011:
      http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2012/04/dod-goes-agile.html


      I would suggest that you take a look at the other referenced on Jeff's
      site, some of which are from defence.gov. It would seam however that US
      government sites use a document style that requires a lawyer to interpret.
      I do believe this to be a conspiracy to keep all those US law graduates
      busy... good luck...

      your analysis and conclusions are hugely simplistic and shallow and you
      show few if any references to back up your claims. There are too many

      @kevin if you follow the links above for both US and UK government sites
      you can follow the rabbit-hole  down into the bowls of the respective
      government procurement guidelines and see the changes for yourself. The
      new US guidelines were proposed in 2010, written in 2011, and came into
      effect in 2013....
