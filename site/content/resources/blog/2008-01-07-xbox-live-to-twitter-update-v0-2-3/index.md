I have updated the [Xbox Live to Twitter application](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/01/04/xbox-live-to-twitter.aspx) and it works quite well now. There are currently too many updates as you can see from my twitter on the left of my blog ![smile_omg](images/smile_omg-2-2.gif).

I will hopefully be adding some more customisation functionality to allow "only online" or "only title" changes to propagate. I may try to add some SQL Compact bits so differences in Achievements can be logged, but the data is currently limited...

I like this play pen as it allows me to explore some of the .NET 3.5 functionality and improve (much needed) my UI skills.

You can [download the application](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx) from [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com) along with all the [source code](http://www.codeplex.com/XboxLiveStatus).
