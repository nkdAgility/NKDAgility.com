    width="100" height="75"/>Recently I was burned rather heavily be Microsoft
    Billing due to their inability to change the region (country) of an account.
    Yes, you heard me right, there is NO way to change your billing region and
    the ONLY solution Microsoft can offer is to create a new account.</p>

    <p>This would not be so bad if it was not for the plethora of services that
    have recently started using Live ID and I brought this issue up at the last
    MVP summit. My primary live id will always be the one I have had for ~10
    years, but I now have to have another live id for every country I end up
    living in.</p>

    <h3>First Burn – Xbox</h3>

    width="150" height="69"/>Anyone that knows me would have heard me rant on
    this one. If you spend 7 years using Xbox Live building up 15000+ gamer
    score and spending £2000+ (~$3000) on content and subscriptions only to
    loose EVERYTHING because I took a job in another country!</p>

    <p>The result is that I (any this affects my family of 4) have two Live ID’s
    to manage. Both with content and neither with the full story.</p>

    <h3>Second Burn – Windows Phone 7</h3>

    <p><img title="windows_phone_logo300x300" style="border-left-width: 0px;
    border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px;
    float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline;
    padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0"
    alt="windows_phone_logo300x300" align="left"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/10/windows_phone_logo300x300.jpg"
    width="150" height="150"/></p>

    <p>You would think for the Windows Phone launch that they would have solved
    this problem, at least for it. But after logging into my brand new T-Mobile
    US HD7 I was encouraged to download the “Tesco” application and I could only
    use my UK Credit cards!</p>

    <p>This is not good… it is not a good experience, and I had to figure out
    how to hard reset my phone on the first day that I had it in order to change
    out the Live ID from <a
    href="mailto:martin@hins***ood.com">martin@hins***ood.com</a> to my new xbox
    <a href="mailto:martin-us@hins****ood.com">martin-us@hins****ood.com</a>
    address.</p>

    <p>What if I go back to the UK and take my phone with me. Granted some of
    the apps are US specific, like a Walmart app, but most of the ones that I
    have bought would not have a problem. And what about the crap excuse of
    “tax” legal issues. What a load of tripe…. My Google phone and apps do not
    have this problem! I was barely off the plane when I saw US apps in $ and
    could buy them with either my US credit card or my UK one.</p>

    <p>Not only that, but my phone is tightly integrated to Windows Live…
    SkyDrive, Facebook, Twitter among other things… it is just a pity that it is
    using the wrong Live ID.</p>

    <p>What the heak Microsoft! Why are you driving me away!</p>

    <h3>Future Burn – Holy mother of….</h3>

    <p>Do you even realise what you loose when you create a new live ID? Can you
    name all of the services that use Live Billing that you will loose
    continuity on when you change country?</p>

    <p>Here is the small list that affects me:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Xbox Live</strong> – Achievements, Gamer Score, Content
    (thousands of dollars worth), Membership  </li>

    <li><strong>SkyDrive Storage</strong> – Photos, Files  </li>

    <li><strong>Zune</strong> – I have some movies bought in the UK and some in
    the US  </li>

    <li><strong>Office 360</strong> – Documents  </li>

    <li><strong>Windows Phone</strong> – Integration  </li>

    <li><strong>MSDN Subscriptions</strong>  </li>

    <li><strong>Azure Services</strong> – Online services, Servers, etc..  </li>

    <li><strong>TFS Azure</strong> – Source Control, Work Item Tracking …
    etc.<br /><em><strong>NOTE: </strong>One of the folks from the product team
    looked me up at the last bash and they are aware of the issue as it would
    relate to TFS Service. To that end they will not be using Live billing.
    </em> </li>

    <li><strong>Windows 8 Login</strong> – Settings, Wallpapers and Tight
    integration on all levels </li>

    </ul>

    <p>With Xbox, Windows Phone and Windows 8 all using your Live ID for login
    into the system the problem hits ALL of Microsoft's services.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>You cant use your new countries payment methods  </li>

    <li>You can’t access any features that are country specific </li>

    </ul>

    <p><img title="windows-live" style="border-left-width: 0px;
    border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px;

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/10/windows-live.jpg" width="300"
    height="301"/><br /><strong>Figure: I am trying to decide if this is a
    joke</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, our online world comes together a long as you stay in the one
    country for the rest of your life!</p>

    <h3>Bottom Line</h3>

    <p>Like me, are screwed! For now…</p>

    <p>The only possible solution that MUST be in place for Hosted Services
    &amp; Windows 8 requires two things:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>The ability to change your billing region  </li>

    <li>The ability for exiting screwed users to merge all of there content,
    data, services and profile data into a single profile </li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong><em>What do you think is going to be the response from Enterprise
    when their employees start having issues with signing into their laptops,
    desktops and phones!</em></strong></p>

    <blockquote><p><em>“I am sorry, you may have bought that app from the US
    store and then moved to the US, but you can no longer buy it let alone use
    it. And that is just tough!”<br />-Fictitious Live Rep.</em></p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>What can I do?</h3>

    <p>The only way to even attempt to fix this is to make sure that Microsoft
    realises how big this problem is now, and how it will affect users in the
    future.</p>

      My problem is no longer the change of Live ID. Moving countries 3 times in
      6 years I was forced to create 2 new accounts in two different countries.
      The real bonus would come from the possibility to merge all the accounts I
      have into one, and having of course the services from the country where I
      live in now.
