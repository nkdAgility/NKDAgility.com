    <p class="lead">Before the "<a
    href="http://www.scrum.org/professionalscrumfoundations/">Professional Scrum
    Foundations</a>" course ever existed I was tasked with delivering a
    practical Scrum foundation course for our customers. I came up with a 2 day
    “Scrum Foundation” course that included lots of practical exercises and
    leveraged the existing <a href="http://www.scrum.org/scrumopen/">Scrum
    Open</a> exam. But why would you want it and is that all you need?</p>

    <hr />

    <p>It is hard to adopt Scrum. You just have to read Ken’s “Scrum is hard and
    Disruptive” to understand just how hard!</p>

    <h2>But is that bad?</h2>

    <p>The reason that more organisations start looking hard at Agile and Scrum
    adoption is that we, as an industry, have lost the trust of business. The
    reason that we have lost the trust of business is that we (the IT industry)
    have proven time and again that we are:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>unable to deliver on time</li>

    <li>unable to deliver on budget</li>

    <li>unable to deliver what the business need&nbsp;</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Is it any wonder that business does not trust us?</p>

    <blockquote><ol>

    <li>Scrum is a framework for iterative, incremental development using
    cross-functional, self-managing teams. It is built on industry best
    practices, lean thinking, and empirical process control.</li>

    <li>Scrum is optimized for high yield product management and product
    development. Scrum is particularly appropriate for high risk, complex, large
    projects and can be used when other parts of the endeavour are hardware or
    even waterfall development.</li>

    <li>If waterfall suits current needs, continue using it.</li>

    <li>An enterprise can use Scrum as a tool to become the best product
    development and management organization in its market. Scrum will highlight
    every deficiency and impediment that the enterprise has so the enterprise
    can fix them and change into such an organization.</li>

    <li>Whenever an enterprise modifies or only partially implements Scrum, it
    is hiding or <br />obscuring one or more dysfunctionalities that restrict
    its competence in product <br />development and management.</li>

    <li>The iterative, incremental nature of Scrum puts stress on the product
    development organization to improve its engineering skills and on the
    product management organization to optimize the return on investment of
    every release and project. The phrase, “That can’t be done here” really
    means that it will be very difficult to do so. The gap between current
    practices and target practices is a measure of incompetence and <br
    />competitive risk.</li>

    <li>The use of Scrum to become an optimized product development and
    management organization is a change process that must be led from the top
    and requires change by everyone within the enterprise. Change is extremely
    difficult and fraught with conflict, and may take many years of sustained
    effort. Turnover of staff and management can be expected.</li>

    <li>The most serious impediments to using Scrum are habits of waterfall,
    predictive thinking over the last twenty to thirty years; these have pawned
    command and control management, belief that demanding something will make it
    happen, and the willingness of development to cut quality to meet dates.
    These are inbred habits that we aren’t even aware of anymore.</li>

    <li>The focus of using Scrum is the change from old habits to new ways of
    doing business. Scrum is not implemented or rolled-out as a process; it is
    used to foment change.</li>

    <li>Scrum is not a methodology that needs enhancing. That is how we got into
    trouble in the first place, thinking that the problem was not having a
    perfect methodology. Effort centres on the changes in the enterprise that is
    needed.</li>

    <li>Iterative, incremental development is much harder than waterfall
    development; everything that was hard in waterfall engineering practices now
    has to be done every iteration, and this is incredibly hard. It is not
    impossible, but has to be worked toward over time.</li>

    <li>Managing a release or project to deliver only the highest value
    functionality and not deliver the rest optimizes value [and] is the job of
    product management and customers.</li>

    <li>Self-managing teams are extremely productive. When they work closely
    with the customer to derive the best solution to a need, they and the
    customer are even more productive.</li>

    <li>A team consists of people under pressure to do their best. Conflict is
    natural and the team needs to know how to deal with the conflict and have
    resources to draw on when needed.</li>

    <li>The role of an enterprises management changes from telling people what
    to do to leading and helping everyone do their best to achieve goals. People
    aren’t resources and managers aren’t bosses</li>

    </ol>

    <p>An interesting point to note is #3. If what you are doing works, then
    keep doing it, but usually if you are reading something like this, or
    thinking of any sort of Agile training then everything is not going well
    with Waterfall <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style:

    <p>In order to help a Development Team adopt Scrum there are three things
    that they will need:</p>

    <h2>Training</h2>

    <p>Wither this is formal training or in-house adoptive training it is
    crucial that everyone attain the same level of understanding of the target
    operating model and they can then understand what it means to them.</p>

    <p>This is the reason that I created the Scrum Foundation course. It is a
    level setting course that is designed to put the team on the right track
    from the start.</p>

    (BI) in Chicago this week</strong></p>

    <h2>Mentoring</h2>

    <p>Once a team starts implementing Scrum they need a little extra help.
    While teams that have no on-going Scrum Mentoring do succeed at Scrum, more
    often they fail, or take a really long time to adopt. With a Mentor that is
    able to answer questions and attend the Sprint Review and Retrospective team
    are more easily able to adapt. This mentor does not need to be full time,
    but available to answer questions when the team has them.</p>

    <h2>Dedication</h2>

    <p>As Ken has said, Scrum is hard to adopt and disruptive to your
    organisation. It will shake things up and you need the dedication and
    commitment to follow through. Things will get harder before they get better
    and it will be hard for the organisation to change on many levels.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p>There will be clashes between the business and IT as the Business asserts
    control over what is built and when. This is a critical process and as the
    Development Team builds trust with the Business the rest of the IT hierarchy
    will feel more and more isolated until it adapts and gets stuck into the
    process as well.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Individuals will worry about their job security as things change around
    them until they begin to understand the niches available and which ones fit
    them.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Individuals will be challenged and upset by the mixed messages they get
    as the understanding of the scope of change takes place within an
    organisation.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p>Metrics will change as trust is built up between Business, IT and the
    Team. Certain metrics, measures and gates will start to change and often
    disappear as the reason that they existed (distrust) starts to be
    eroded.</p>

    </li>

    </ul>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right:
    0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image"
    alt="image" src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/09/image.png"
    width="282" height="376" border="0" /> <br /><strong>Figure: Not all early
    sprints will be successful</strong></p>

    <p>During a Scrum adoption <strong>expect to fail early and often</strong>.
    No, its more than that. I WANT to fail early and often as it is far less
    costly than the Waterfall (and and long iterative approach) where the risk
    is at the end and you <strong>fail late</strong>.</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Would you rather fail 4 agile projects at Sprint 4 or would you
    rather fail one waterfall in its 3rd year?</strong> <br />note: one is circa
    20 times more expensive than the other… can you guess which?</li>

    </ul>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right:
    0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;"

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/09/grafx-agile-risk-value-cycle.jpg"
    width="600" height="393" border="0" /> <br /><strong>Figure: Agile risk is
    all up front</strong></p>

    <p>Remember it is HARD to do Scrum, your teams are not used to this process
    and your business is only beginning to understand the benefits. This is
    usually when IT management get cold feet and try to pull out. Remember that
    it is the Business that pays the bills and that they are usually on-board by
    now. The team may not have had a successful sprint but they will have been
    able to show "something" and the Product Owner will have been able to give
    feedback.</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>How do you think the business will react if you suddenly take
    that feedback loop away from them?</strong></li>

    </ul>
