Even though I have only been at Northwest Cadence for a short time I have already done so much. What I really wanted to do was let you guys know about a bunch of FREE training that NWC offers.

These sessions are at a fantastic time for the UK as 9am PST (Seattle time) is around 5pm GMT. Its a fantastic way to finish off your Fridays ![Smile](images/d8a99e5b9476_9304-wlEmoticon-smile_2-2-2.png) and with the lack of love for developers in the UK set to continue I would love some of you guys to get some from the US instead.

There are really two offerings. The first is something called Coffee talks that take you through an hours worth of detail in a specific category.

## Coffee Talks

These coffee talks have some superb topics and you can get excellent interaction with the presenter as they are kind of informal.
