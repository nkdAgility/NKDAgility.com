    width="240" height="57"/></a>This week I was at the ALM Summit in Redmond.
    There was a very interesting talk from David Starr of Scrum.org going over
    the recent changes in Scrum. These changes are, I think, designed to battle
    the things that have made Scrum unpalatable to many people.</p> <p><br
    clear="all"/></p> <p> <hr /> </p> <p> The reality is that many people and
    organisation are failing at and being turned away from Scrum by the
    fanaticism that surrounds it. Scrum.org is taking these issues and tackling
    them head on. </p> <p>At Northwest Cadence we worked with one team whose
    Scrum Coach told them that they were not doing Scrum. Why? Well, the
    Development Team had a disabled person who was unable to stand and they
    decided, as a team,&nbsp; not to stand up during the Daily Scrum. Shocked?
    Well you should be, we are in the era of intolerance and fanaticism and we
    all need a kick up the ass for that. Scrum.org is doing its part of that
    kicking and thus there are changes to the body of knowledge that is Scrum to
    make it more tolerant, adaptable and palatable for a wider group of people
    while not changing its core tenants.</p> <p>The first change we saw was the
    publication of the new <a href="http://www.scrum.org/scrumguides/">Scrum
    Guide by Ken and Jeff</a> that saw the removal of all of those things that
    are not part of core Scrum. If you were to buy "Scrum the Board Game" you
    would not expect the getting started guide to include all of the strategies
    for playing the game, but instead it would contain the "rules" of how to
    play. </p><p><a

    style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px;

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/11/image_thumb.png" width="600"
    height="433"/></a> </p><p><strong>Figure: The rules of the game, not the
    strategy of how to play</strong> </p><p>The <a
    href="http://www.scrum.org/scrumguides/">Scrum Guide</a> is just such a
    distillation of the core principals upon which the Scrum Framework is based.
    Once you have these core principals under your belt you can move forward
    with instituted all of those "practices" that will help you do Scrum well.
    There are many books, blogs and forums to help formulate Strategy and many
    consultants that will help you with adopting Scrum effectively. (Hint: <a
    href="http://nwcadence.com">http://nwcadence.com</a>)  </p><p><a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/11/image8.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px;

    height="302"/></a> </p><p><b>Figure: You are here!</b> </p><p>So if there is
    this line between “not Scrum” and “Scrum” I want to know definitively if I
    am at this line. To do that I need a <strong>simple measurable
    checklist</strong> that lets me know that I am there. A minimal "Definition
    of Doing" or "Scrum Fitness test", if you will, that tells us that we are at
    the first milestone and can then start to look at more advanced concepts to
    improve our performance. <blockquote> <p>A simple measurable checklist: <ol>
    <li>… an ordered Product Backlog </li><li>… Development Teams of 6+-3
    </li><li>… have a Product Owner who owns the backlog </li><li>… a Scrum
    Master who is responsible for process </li><li>… have Sprints of 1 month or
    less </li><li>… Sprints are of a fixed length </li><li>… a Sprint Backlog
    that shows Remaining Work </li><li>… a Sprint Backlog created at Sprint
    Planning </li><li>… Review &amp; Retrospective at the end of each sprint
    </li><li>… working software each Sprint </li><li>… stakeholders who inspect
    the software increment</li></ol></p></blockquote> </p><p
    align="left"><strong>Figure: A simple measurable checklist of Scrum</strong>
    </p><p>If you can say yes to each of these things then you are doing Scrum.
    Are you doing good Scrum? Well, probably not… but you are doing it.
    </p><p>Then what else do you need? </p><p> Well, you will find it hard to
    continue to deliver working software each sprint (#10) without things like
    Automated Testing and Automated Build. You will also find it hard to start
    climbing that hill towards High Performing Scrum without visualising your
    work (Kanban), limiting work in progress, and concentrating on optimising
    Flow both at the micro (inside of the Sprint) and at the macro (wrapping
    Scrum).  </p><p>There are many more things that will help and many of them
    will become Scrum Extensions on Scrum.org as they are submitted and
    approved. This results in the replacement of the phrase "I am doing Scrum
    but...&lt;shame&gt;" with "I am doing Scrum and...&lt;happiness&gt;" and
    hopefully a wider and more positive adoption profile for Scrum.</p>
