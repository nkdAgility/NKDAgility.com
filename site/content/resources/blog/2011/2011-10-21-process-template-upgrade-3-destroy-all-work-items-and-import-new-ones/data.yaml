    best options for <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/">upgrading
    a process template but still keep your data intact</a>, but there is still a
    little bit of ambiguity on how that is achieved.&nbsp; Lets look at the #3
    option from that set in a little more detail.</p><br clear="all"/> <hr /> 
    <p>This solution assumes that you do not care about any of the work items
    that you currently have. We are effectively going to clean out the old
    process template along with all of the data and import a new one.</p>
    <p><font color="#ff0000" size="2"><strong>WARNING: You will loose all of the
    Work Items that you currently have in your Team Project if you follow this
    process (See <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/do-you-know-how-to-upgrade-a-process-template-but-still-keep-your-data-intact/">Do
    you know how to upgrade a process template but still keep your data
    intact?</a> for more options)</strong></font></p> <p>We have a couple of
    things to do, and yes, the order does matter:</p> <ol> <li>Fix Queries 
    </li><li>Fix Reports  </li><li>Tare down old Process Template 
    </li><li>Build up new Process Template</li></ol> <p>This will allow you to
    move from one process template to another, but there are other things that
    might be of importance. Maybe you want to upgrade your SharePoint site as
    well. That however if outside the scope of this post.</p> <ol> <li>
    <h4><strong>Fix Queries</strong></h4> <p>Because we want to keep the old
    queries around, and you can do nothing but delete them once you delete the
    Work item Types we need to move them before we do anything to the Team
    Project. it may be that some of the teams spent a long time getting their
    queries “just right” and we don’t just want to delete that hard work.</p>
    <ol> <li> <h5><strong>Create a folder called “_2008Archive”</strong></h5>
    <p>TFS 2010 added the ability to have Query folders. Here is hoping that we
    get them on Builds as well in the future.</p> <p><a

    old queries</strong></p> </li><li> <h5><strong>Move all of the existing
    Queries into this folder</strong></h5> <p>Luckily we can drag and drop
    Queries within the same Team Project.</p> <p><a

    saved</strong></p> </li><li> <h5><strong>Copy all of the new queries into
    the team project</strong></h5> <p>We have at least one Team Project that was
    created with the new template (TfsCustomisations), and even more luckily we
    can drag and drop Queries between Team Projects. </p> <p><a

    height="345"/></a></p> <p><strong>Figure: Shiny new Queries are now waiting
    for the team</strong></p></li></ol> </li><li> <h4><strong>Fix Reports
    </strong></h4> <p>You will need to add the new reports to TFS, but
    unfortunately while there is drag and drop support for moving reports within
    a Team Project there is no way to drag them <em>into</em> a Team Project,
    but there his a command line tool to support this. However, prior to running
    it you should again create a “_2008Archive” folder to load all of the
    existing reports into. Again there may be a bunch of custom reports in there
    that the team does not want to loose. Once you have done that you can call
    the command line option to install the new templates</p> <p><img
    style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/10/image1.png" width="268"
    height="582"/></p> <p><strong>Figure: Put all existing reports under
    “_2008Archive”</strong></p><pre class="brush: ps;">tfpt addprojectreports
    /collection:%tpc% /teamproject:%tp% /processtemplate:"Scrum for Team System
    v3.0.3784.03" /force</pre>

    <p><strong>Figure: Command to add all of the Reports for a Process Template
    to TFS<br /><br /></strong></p>

    <p>note: You will need to have permission to add reports to Reporting
    Services. Make sure that you are in the Team Foundation Content Manger”
    role.</p>

    </li><li>

    <h4><strong>Tare down old Process Template</strong></h4>

    <p>This is where the demolition expert in you gets to have a little fun. It
    is very complicated to build things, and not so much to destroy them. Now
    that we have all of our data exported and transformed we can go ahead and
    destroy all of the Work Item Type Definitions (WITD) that are in that Team
    Project.</p>

    <p>Because I am running a whole lot of command against multiple Team
    Projects and I do not want to have to change out the Team Project Collection
    every time, here is a little hint for the command line.</p><pre
    class="brush: ps; ">set
    tpc=http://tfsServerName:8080/tfs/teamProjectCollectionName</pre>

    <p><br /><strong>Figure: Set a variable so you don't have to add things to
    every command</strong> <br /></p><pre class="brush: ps;">witadmin listwitd
    /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]"</pre>

    <p><br /><strong>Figure: Get a list of all the Work Item Types </strong></p>

    <p>This will give you a list of all of the Work Item Type’s that are used in
    your Team Project. You will need to “destroy” each one using the
    “destroywitd” command that is part of “witadmin”. In this case the current
    project is the “Scrum for Team System v2” template so the below command
    would remove them.</p><pre class="brush: ps;">witadmin destroywitd
    /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]" /n:"Bug" /noprompt

    witadmin destroywitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]" /n:"Product
    Backlog Item" /noprompt

    witadmin destroywitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]" /n:"Sprint
    Backlog Item" /noprompt

    witadmin destroywitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]"
    /n:"Impediment" /noprompt

    witadmin destroywitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]" /n:"Sprint
    Retrospective" /noprompt

    witadmin destroywitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]" /n:"Sprint"
    /noprompt</pre>

    <p><strong>Figure: Delete the default Work Items, but don’t forget any
    custom ones</strong></p>

    <p><em>note: Because this was a Team Project that was upgraded from TFS 2008
    there are no links or categories to update. You will also need to make sure
    that you do something with all of the custom fields and Work Item Types that
    have been added.</em></p>

    <p>

    </p><p><strong></strong></p><strong>Build up new Process Template</strong>

    </li><li>

    <p>Building up the Work Item Types is not quite as much fun as tearing them
    down, but it does give you more of a sense of achievement. In order to
    “install” the SfTSv3 Process Template you need to:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>

    <h5><strong>Install the SfTSv3 Work Item Type Definitions</strong></h5>

    <p>These new work item types can be easily added to make it look as if the
    Project always had this process template. There are still more things that
    we will need to do later to make this a workable solution.</p><pre
    class="brush: ps;">witadmin importwitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project
    Name]" /f:".WorkItemTrackingTypeDefinitionsAcceptanceTest.xml"

    witadmin importwitd /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team Project Name]"

    /f:".WorkItemTrackingTypeDefinitionsTeamSprint.xml"</pre>

    <p><strong>Figure: Add the Work Items that you put under version control in
    the TfsCustomisations Team Project<br /><br /></strong></p>

    <p><em>note: You may also get a TF212018 error if you are doing this on an
    upgraded Team Project Collection. This is because one of the fields in the
    Work Item Type Definition Xml is different than the one on the server. There
    are a number of fields that will require the spaces to be removed from their
    names in order to import the work item. This is just fine and if you make
    the changes you will be able to import.</em></p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>TF212018: Work item tracking schema validation error: TF26177: The field
    System.AreaId cannot be renamed from “AreaID” to “Area ID”. If you remove
    the spaces you will be able to import it.</p></blockquote>

    <p><strong>Figure: This is an example message</strong></p>

    </li><li>

    <h5><strong>Install the Categories</strong></h5>

    <p>Categories as new in TFS 2010 and all reports to load Categories rather
    that be hard coded to particular Work Item Types. The only stipulation /
    limitation is that a Work Item can only be in one Category.</p><pre
    class="brush: ps;">witadmin importcategories /collection:%tpc% /p:"[Team
    Project Name]" /f:".WorkItemTrackingcategories.xml"</pre>

    <p><strong>Figure: Add categories to enable some of the TFS 2010
    functionality</strong></p>

    </li><li>

    <h5><strong>Install the Link Types</strong></h5>

    <p>Link Types enable one of the core features of TFS 2010. The ability to
    have nested work items. It is worth noting that there are some built in Link
    Types that are not listed here that will support MS Project and other tools.
    These will already have been added by the upgrade process.</p><pre
    class="brush: ps;">witadmin importLinktype /collection:%tpc%

    once</strong></p></li></ol><!--EndFragment--></li></ol>

      Hi. This is a great guide, thanks. Can you tell me in step 4.1, where are
      these xml files sourced from? I get that I am installing an xml file, but
      I get file not found and I am unable to locate these files on either the
      server (2013.1) or the client (VS2010 or 2012). Thanks.

      NVM - I got it. I created a dummy test project with my target template,
      then in Team Explorer Settings, under Team Project Collection - Process
      Template Manager - Download Templates and used the resulting xml files to
      populate the project I was upgrading. Thanks.

      If you connect to your TFS server you should see a "Settings" link in Team
      Explorer which will lead to a page with "Manage Process Templates" where
      you can download the one that you want. You do not need to create a Team
      Project to access this.

      I had to do some more steps to complete the process. (Kanban template
      -&gt; Scrum 2.2 TFS2012.2)

      1. Upload an empty categories.xml file so I could delete the exsisting
      WIT's. WIT in categorie cannot be destroyed.

      2. After destroying the old wit's and creating the new wit's upload the
      correct categories.xml file

      3. I was able to create the reports after the new WIT's were created

      4. Import the common and agile process files to enable my TWA backlog
      feature again

      5. Fix the Product Backlog Board with the correct states

      So now my template seems to be working again. No errors are shown anymore.
      But the PBI/Bug items are not displayed on my Product Backlog Board?

      Love the detailed instructions and the alternative scenario's you describe
      in the post. Will use them in the future! Hope my feedback helps to
      improve the process.

      Thanks Martin this was really helpful! I just used this to migrate from
      2010 Agile to 2013 Scrum during an upgrade and I found that I needed a few
      extra steps to get it to work for that specific migration path (I guess
      it's fairly different than 2008-&gt;2010):


      1) Categories: Before you can remove the work item types you have to
      remove the categories that contain those work item types. Use "witadmin
      exportcategories...." to export the categories file, Edit that file by
      removing all  tags and turn  into a single self-closing tag (If you use a
      separate closing  tag it appears to import incorrectly), then reimport the
      categories file using "witadmin importcategories...."


      2) ProcessConfiguration: Import the ProcessConfiguration.xml file after
      you've reimported the work item types and categories: "witadmin
      importprocessconfig /collection:$tpc /p:$tp /f:'.WorkItem
      TrackingProcessProcessConfiguration.xml'"


      3) Old Queries: The queries I saved before (your step 1) throw errors when
      I try to run them (even on an empty system) complaining about missing
      fields (StackRank - obviously left over from the former process template).
      From what I've read, Queries are fairly static so even renaming things
      sometimes requires manual updates. If you edit an old query in Visual
      Studio (I couldn't fix them in Web Access) just keep clicking "OK" when
      error messages pop up, then click "Column Options" which will trigger
      another message box. Then, the Save icon will become available to click,
      and VS will have cleared all these old fields. I had to do this manually
      for most all of the old queries. 



      4) New Queries: To bring queries from the new scrum template over, I tried
      using wiqadmin (wiqadmin.codeplex.com), but that gave me errors about an
      invalid value for the "Iteration Path" field. For some reason my Iteration
      path changed during this process, I'm not sure about that. So, I open each
      .wiq file in VS, update the Iteration Path field to a valid value (valid
      values appear in the dropdown), save the query file, then go to
      File-&gt;Save [Query Name] As, then save the query on the server under an
      appropriate path.


      There is unfortunately 1 error messages I'm getting in the web access that
      I haven't been able to resolve yet:


      1) In the Work-&gt;Backlogs section, on either the Features-&gt;Board or
      Backlog items-&gt;Board, I'm getting "The column configurations are not
      valid. The board cannot be displayed". I have an option to remap the
      columns, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to remap them to, or if the
      correct values are present in the drop down boxes it provides. Is there a
      file I missed importing from the template using witadmin?




      Thanks again for your writeup, and if you have any ideas on how I can
      solve this last issue I'd really appreciate it!
