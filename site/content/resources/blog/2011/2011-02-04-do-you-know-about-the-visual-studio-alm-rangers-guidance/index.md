I have been tasked with investigating the Guidance available around Visual Studio 2010 for one of our customers and it makes sense to make this available to everyone. The official guidance around Visual Studio 2010 has been created by the Visual Studio ALM Rangers and is a brew of a bunch of really clever guys experiences working with the tools and customers.

I will be creating a series of posts on the different guidance options as many people still do not know about them ![Smile](images/Do-you-know-about-the-Visual-Studio-ALM-_D18D-wlEmoticon-smile_2-2-2.png) even though [Willy-Peter Schaub](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub) has done a fantastic job of making sure they get the [recognition](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2009/08/07/vsts-rangers-introducing-the-vsts-rangers-recognition-program.aspx) they deserve. There is a full list of all of the [Rangers Solutions and Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/ee358787) on MSDN, but I wanted to add my own point of view to the usefulness of each one. If you don’t know who the rangers are you should have a look at the [Visual Studio ALM Rangers Index](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2010/06/18/introducing-the-visual-studio-alm-rangers-an-index-to-all-rangers-covered-on-this-blog.aspx) to see the full breadth of where the rangers are. All of the [Rangers Solutions are available on Codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com/site/search?TagName=Rangers&ProjectSearchText=%22Rangers%22) where you can download them and add reviews…

These solutions took a very long time to put together and I wanted to make sure that we all understand the value of the free time that member of The Product Team, Visual Studio ALM MVP’s and partners put in to make them happen.
