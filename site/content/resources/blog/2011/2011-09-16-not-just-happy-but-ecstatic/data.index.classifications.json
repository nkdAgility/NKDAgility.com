While there are elements of adaptability and problem-solving, the focus is on specific tools and practices rather than the intentional shaping of outcomes or the interplay between human and AI capabilities. The mention of a successful deployment does not delve into the principles of Agentic Agility or provide a detailed exploration of its concepts.",
