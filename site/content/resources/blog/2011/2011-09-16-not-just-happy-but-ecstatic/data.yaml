    width="145" height="53" />As a consultant I have customers. Unfortunately
    being a <strong>consultant</strong> rather than a
    <strong>contractor</strong> has the down side that I hardly ever here from
    my customers after my engagement ends. </p>  <br clear="all" />  <hr /> 
    <p>I just noticed an email from one of my more challenging engagements in
    the UK for a company that specialises in deploying solutions in Microsoft
    Dynamics. They had problems with many divergent versions of their
    application as well as a complicated, manual and error prone deployment
    model.</p>  <p>I worked with them on a <strong>Tools</strong> and
    <strong>Practices</strong> engagement for only around 10 days spread over a
    couple of months an this was the result:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Just a quick
    email to say thanks for your help on moving us forward on TFS 2010. My
    vision for having an installed website as a product is now complete and
    Ahmed has been fully trained up with the <strong>rolled up
    newspaper</strong>.</p>    <p>We now have a build process that creates a
    custom MSI file (for both the test and live sites) for each customer or any
    customer we choose to put in a build parameter. The MSI, all built in lovely
    WIX, installs the product and runs the datadude process to synch the
    database. Job done!</p>    <p>I had an opportunity to demo this to another
    company last month, whilst I was in Vegas. They have a similar issue with
    code going out of synch from the DB and managing too many branches. I
    created an empty db added an entry to my hosts file for the site name and
    ran the installer. Instant website, all the defaults populated. They
    couldn’t believe it as they have over 40 branches to manage.</p>    <p>I’m
    now looking at the QA process with MTM, which looks fantastic, so fingers
    crossed!</p>    <p>Anyway, thanks again. It’s been a life changer here!

    </blockquote>  <p>I really enjoyed working with this team and that brings me
    back to the other things that I did when I was reading this email. I looked
    up the cost of flights. And I was really surprised.</p>  <p>I can fly to the
    UK from Seattle for $733 (£464.00) return! That is cheaper than most of the
    flights for client engagements here. Yes, it may cost a little more in hotel
    costs, and I would be less flexible in flights, but it is potentially
    doable.</p>  <p>Not saying I am going to, but I am a little more inclined to
    seek clients in Europe as well.</p>  <p>p.s. The metaphorical <strong>Rolled
    Up Newspaper</strong> approach works very well for developers.</p>
