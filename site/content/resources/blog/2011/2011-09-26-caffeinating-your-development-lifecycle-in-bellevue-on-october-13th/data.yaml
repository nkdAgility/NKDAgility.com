    width="281" height="72" />Northwest Cadence has decided that while online
    events are good, nothing beats in-person. If you’re in the area and
    available, we would love to have you attend our inaugural event at the
    Microsoft Store in Bellevue in a few weeks!</p>  <br clear="all" />    <hr
    />    <p><a href="http://blog.bsktcase.com/">Cheryl</a> noticed that MSFT
    has a presentation room at its Bellevue Store, and we decided to make use of
    it for our Coffee Talks. Because of the success of the Test Tools in-person
    that we did only a few months ago we have been talking internally about two
    things:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Attending more User Groups</strong>      
    <br />This is a little more difficult as it will require us to have
    knowledge of all of the UG’s available wherever our consultant happen to be.
    </li>    <li><strong>Coffee talks In-Person</strong>       <br />In-person
    events have far more impact than remote, and it is a lot easier to illicit
    the in session interaction that coffee talks warrant. </li> </ul>  <p>We are
    starting with the Coffee Talks, and did I say… they are early! You can come
    and still make it to work before 9am <img style="border-bottom-style: none;

    Talks, you ask? As the name suggests, these are morning ALM discussions that
    are sure to wake you up and get your day off to a great start! For our LIVE
    Coffee Talk events, hosted at The Microsoft Store, we will serve coffee (and
    some tasty coffee cakes!) and provide live demonstrations of Visual Studio
    features on the theatre’s big screen. We will have special giveaways and
    door prizes to make it even more fun! When we’re finished, you will have
    plenty of time to get to the office – or stay a little longer and play in
    the Store before it opens!      <br clear="all" /></p>    <p><b>Join
    Northwest Cadence for fresh brewed coffee, a variety of specialty coffee
    cakes, and some morning </b><b>ALM discussions that are sure to wake you up

    with help from Northwest Cadence and the latest Microsoft tools.&#160; Learn
    how robust Application Lifecycle Management practices support your entire
