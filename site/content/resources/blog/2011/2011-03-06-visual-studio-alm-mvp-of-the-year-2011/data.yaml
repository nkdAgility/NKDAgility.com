    peers decided to vote for me as a contender for Visual Studio ALM MVP of the
    year. I am not sure what I did to deserve this, but a number of people have
    commented that I have a rather useful blog.</p>  <br />  <hr />  <p>I feel
    wholly unworthy to join the ranks of previous winners:</p>  <ul>   <li><a
    href="http://www.edsquared.com/2010/02/24/Microsoft+MVP+Of+The+Year+For+VSTS+TFS.aspx"
    target="_blank">Ed Blankenship (2010)</a> </li>    <li><a
    href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/team_system_mvp.html"
    target="_blank">Martin Woodward (2009)</a> </li> </ul>  <p>Thank you to
    everyone who voted regardless of who you voted for. If there was a prize for
    the best group of MVP’s then the Visual Studio ALM MVP would be a clear
    winner, as would the product group of product groups that is Visual Studio
    ALM Group. To use a phrase that I have learned since moving to Seattle and
    probably use too much: you guys are all just
    <strong><em>awesome</em></strong>.</p>  <p>I have tried my best in the last
    year to document not only every problem that I have had with Team Foundation
    Server (TFS), but also to document as many of the things I am doing as
    possible. I have taken some of Adam Cogan’s rules to heart and when a
    customer asks me a question I always blog the answer and send them a
    link.</p>  <p>This allows both my blog and my understanding of TFS to grow
    while creating a useful bank of content. The idea is that if one customer
    asks, all benefit. I try, when writing for my blog, to capture both the
    essence and the context for a problem being solved. This allows more people
    to benefit as they do not need to understand the specifics of an environment
    to gain value. </p>  <p>I have a number of goals for this year that I think
    will help increase value in the community:</p>  <ul>   <li>persuade my new
    colleagues at Northwest Cadence to do more <a

      Congrats Martin! Having worked a bit with Steve, Shad and Jeff over the
      past year I have to agree. These guys have a lot to contribute to the
      community and this will only lead to more success for the NWC team. I know
      that time is not their luxury; however, a goal of a 1 blog a week or so
      with a few well placed tweets will go a long way.

      Martin, You do have some "big shoes to fill", but you definately deserve
      the honor.<br /><br />As a side note: If you adapted Adam's rules...you
      should have had a screen shot in your post &lt;grin&gt;
