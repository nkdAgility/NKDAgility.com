For some reason this year some of my peers decided to vote for me as a contender for Visual Studio ALM MVP of the year. I am not sure what I did to deserve this, but a number of people have commented that I have a rather useful blog.

I feel wholly unworthy to join the ranks of previous winners:

- [Ed Blankenship (2010)](http://www.edsquared.com/2010/02/24/Microsoft+MVP+Of+The+Year+For+VSTS+TFS.aspx)
- [Martin Woodward (2009)](http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/team_system_mvp.html)

Thank you to everyone who voted regardless of who you voted for. If there was a prize for the best group of MVP’s then the Visual Studio ALM MVP would be a clear winner, as would the product group of product groups that is Visual Studio ALM Group. To use a phrase that I have learned since moving to Seattle and probably use too much: you guys are all just **_awesome_**.

I have tried my best in the last year to document not only every problem that I have had with Team Foundation Server (TFS), but also to document as many of the things I am doing as possible. I have taken some of Adam Cogan’s rules to heart and when a customer asks me a question I always blog the answer and send them a link.

This allows both my blog and my understanding of TFS to grow while creating a useful bank of content. The idea is that if one customer asks, all benefit. I try, when writing for my blog, to capture both the essence and the context for a problem being solved. This allows more people to benefit as they do not need to understand the specifics of an environment to gain value.

I have a number of goals for this year that I think will help increase value in the community:

- persuade my new colleagues at Northwest Cadence to do more [blogging](http://blog.nwcadence.com) (Steve, Jeff, Shad and Rennie)

I do not think that these things are beyond the realms of do-ability, but we will see…
