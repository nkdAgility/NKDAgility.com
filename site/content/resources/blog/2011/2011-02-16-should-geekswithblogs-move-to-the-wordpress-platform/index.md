Geekswithblogs was my first ever blog and my first post was on 22nd June 2006. Since then very little functionality has been added. This is not a complaint, but rather an observation that it is very hard to keep up with all of the blogging capabilities that people want. My point would be: “Why bother!”

Vote now for a migration of the awesome Geekswithblogs content from SubText to Wordpress.

**Update 2011-01-06 - Due to some friction and lack of interest in the wants of users over technology I have moved my blog to Wordpress anyway. [Do you want to know how?](http://gwbtowp.codeplex.com/)**

Having been a long time user of GWB I have been worried of late by my envy of other blogging platforms. I made a number of requests around 10 months ago for things that almost all blogging platforms provide, but which are not available on GWB.

- **Support other comment frameworks** – The current comment system is so antiquated that it does not even have the common filters like Facebook, twitter or Google login to help prevent spam.
- **Tags are not listed in the RSS** – This can prevent you from getting the Google juice that you deserve
- 301 redirects to a single URL– If you use a custom URL then all your posts are split between both the GWB URL and the custom one. This is VERY bas for SEO.

I realise that it is difficult to find time to add all of the features that all the uber geeks on this site want, so why bother… lets move to the most popular and moded platform available and allow everyone to add whatever widgets they like.

- There are over 13k plugins available
- Easy augmentation model
- Full mobile support
- Regular releases
- lots more…

This could be a turning point in the legendary history of Geeks With Blogs, be part of it…

 

### What can I do to make this happen?
