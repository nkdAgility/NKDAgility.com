I am having a problem on my blog with comments. Namely that you cant see any! This is the downside of relying on a third party tool, but do the problems out weight the benefits?

I am having problems with Disqus on Wordpress in Chrome; My comments don't load, and they do not load the first time in the admin system either. In the Admin system a reload of the page fixes the issue, but on the site, nada.

- **What could be the problem?**
- **How do I fix it?**

Above s the exact information that I put in an email to help@disqus.com,  and do you know the response I got!

> _Hi Martin,

Now I do not know who Ryan is or even if he exists, but all of those questions are already answered by looking at the original email.

- Why is it that they never read that first email?

Come on guys, you can do better!

**_<RANT>_**

_So I still need to reply:_

_**<RESPONCE>**_

##### Ryan,

If you had taken a movement to read my first email, you would have seen all of the answers that you requested. In the future I will remember to send you a blank email with only a subject first so you can provide the reply you did without looking foolish. Anyhoo, here is the information that you requested extracted from the email you already have:

> _\>>a link to a page experiencing this issue;_

All pages as describes. Go to any single blog post page, but the one depicted in the screenshot would be you best bet ([_http://blog.hinshelwood.com/ahaaaa/_](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/ahaaaa/)) its an old post, but short so loads quickly.

> _\>>a step-by-step process to reproduce the issue on our end;_

1. Go to individual post page on site  
      
    _e.g._ [_http://blog.hinshelwood.com/ahaaaa/_](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/ahaaaa/) _(as depicted in the screenshot)_  
    
2. See problem that is demonstrated in this screenshot

> _\>>screenshots of any errors or irregularities in this process -- for more information on how to take a screenshot, visit [http://take-a-screenshot.org/](http://take-a-screenshot.org/)_

Original email bellow contained screenshots. See “Figure: Even on short posts there are no comments” and “Figure: No comment in admin until a reload” below (\*note your email tool has stripped them out but you can clearly see where they were provided). I have provided them here again as well as a link to a blog posts with all of the information available.

> \>>web browser and version being used, e.g. Internet Explorer 9 or Firefox 4 -- to determine this information, visit [http://www.whatbrowseramiusing.co/](http://www.whatbrowseramiusing.co/)

As you can see from the screenshots provided I am using Chrome. The problem does not resent itself in IE9.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further problems extracting information from an email or even new ones that are not answered here.

**<RESPONCE>**

Let see if I get any help… I can’t think I am the only one who's blog does not work with Chrome.
