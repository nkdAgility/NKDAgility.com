Because of the phenomenal success of the [Scrum versus Kanban](http://scrumvskanbanrematch.eventbrite.com/) session that Steven Borg an I did today, we plan on having a rematch to see if Kanban can make a comeback.

Hopefully [Steve1](http://blog.nwcadence.com/author/stevenborg/) can do a better job for Kanban this time…

If you missed todays bout then you are in for a treat as Steve Borg and I go head to head again for a second round of [Scrum vs Kanban](http://scrumvskanbanrematch.eventbrite.com/) … here is what one of the attendees said about the first session:

> The methodology, process and SDLC sessions are often delivered by evangelists who are very prescriptive and critical. Steven and Martin, however, delivered an interactive and thoughtful comparison of the two processes, sharing useful insights into the pros and cons of either and most importantly highlighting the importance of having the freedom of adapting either or both to suit your needs and environment. - [Willy-P](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/willy-peter_schaub/archive/2011/07/22/coffee-talk-scrum-versus-kanban.aspx)

Am I willing to make a prediction?
