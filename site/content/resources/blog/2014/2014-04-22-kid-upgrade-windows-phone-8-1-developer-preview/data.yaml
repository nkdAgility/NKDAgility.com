    <p class="lead">I love new things not just because they are new but because
    they are exiting. Discovery is something that we lose as we get older but it
    should be nurtured so be a kid again and upgrade to Windows Phone 8.1.
    </p><p>As with most people that use a Windows Phone I love it. I am however
    unusual in that I have had Windows running on my phone since the original
    Orange SPV (from HTC) arrived in 2001. That’s right… I have had a smartphone
    in my pocket for more than 10 years. </p><p>It may not have been perfect, in
    fact Windows Mobile was most defiantly not that. However I did have a
    browser, the internet and a camera. Apple copied this for their devices in
    2009 and arguably perfected the interactive nature of these devices and
    propelled them into mainstream. Now as Apple and Android struggle to
    innovate the underdog (Microsoft for a change) have been slowly introducing
    us to Windows Mobile.  </p><p>It has been a bumpy road and Windows Phone 8
    was a vast improvement over Windows Phone 7. My mum still has a 7 device,
    that she still insists is new, and it is a stark contrast whenever I have to
    use it. I recently upgraded my dad to a Nokia 520 which he thinks is
    fabulous and I have been using a Nokia 1020 for a while now. </p><p><img

    width="436" height="772"/> </p><p>My home screen is pretty strait forward
    and I only really use a few apps. As an aside there is a fascination with
    the platform that has the most apps however in my experience you have to
    search through the sewer for the gems. The only apps I use are: <ul>
    <li><strong>NextGen</strong> - An awesome feedreader that has seen me
    through Google Reader and over seamlessly to Feedly.
    </li><li><strong>Facebook</strong> - You know… for posting crap and reading
    memes </li><li><strong>Twitter</strong> - Another app for posting crap.
    </li><li><strong>Bufferapp</strong> - This is a plugin for Windows Phone
    Sharing hub that adds the capability to post through Bufferapp. Bufferapp
    lets me share once and it schedules posts across multiple platforms like
    LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. </li><li><strong>4th &amp;
    Mayor</strong> - For checking in to a location so someone can come and rob
    your house while you are out. </li><li><strong>Amazon Mobile</strong> - I
    see stuff, I scan it… I then get it delivered at home :) Perfect traveling
    companion. </li><li><strong>Endamondo </strong>- For tracking those long
    runs… </li><li><strong>Here Maps</strong> - The best mapping app I have ever
    used comes from Nokia and rocks… </li><li><strong>Audible </strong>- I
    listen to a lot of audio book and this little app has kept me sane when
    traveling. I spend an inordinate amount of time in airports and on
    trains…</li></ul> </p><p>And that’s really it. I have tones of other crap on
    there, mostly for the kids. Oh, did you know that Windows Phone has Kid
    Mode? Kid Mode is a little walled garden that you pick the apps and games
    that are listed. It has its own home screen that you can enable without
    entering your password. This feature was added with Windows Phone 8 but I
    find it so useful I thought it best to reiterate it. </p><p><img

    width="465" height="772"/> </p><p>If you are running Windows Phone 8 on your
    phone right now then you can get the developer preview of Windows Phone 8.1
    (You do not need to be a developer): <ol> <li>Go register free at <a
    href="http://appstudio.windowsphone.com">http://appstudio.windowsphone.com</a>. 
    </li><li>Then go to "Windows Phone Preview for Developers" and install the
    "Preview for Developers" app.  </li><li>Go to Settings, then System Update
    and update your phone. You may need to do this more than once. My Nokia 1020
    needed 2 updates before I was presented with the Windows Phone 8.1
    Preview.</li></ol> </p><p><img title="clip_image003" style="border-top: 0px;

    src="http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/clip_image003.jpg"
    width="465" height="772"/> </p><p>Although it says 5-10 on the first update
    and 15-30 on the 8.1 update you need to take this with a pinch of salt. It
    really depends on how much data you have on your phone and how fast your
    internet connection is. The first two updates on my Nokia 1020 took way
    longer than 10 minutes (more like the 15-30) however my connection speed was
    pretty slow in the Alps last week. WiFi was not much better as it was a
    satellite link with high latency. </p><p><img title="clip_image004"

    src="http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/clip_image004.jpg"
    width="465" height="772"/> </p><p>If you update your phone to Windows Phone
    8.1 Preview today you will at least get the RTM when it becomes available
    and likely there will be a couple of refreshes. Note though that this is a
    "Developer Preview" and don't expect everything to work. So far I have the
    following issues: <ul> <li><strike><strong>Facebook can't post
    pictures</strong> - For some reason I have been unable to post pictures with
    the built in Facebook app. It just gets stuck on the send.. I have been able
    to post videos so I can only think it is a bug.</strike> Looks like this
    only affects slow connections like I had last week. </li><li><strong>No
    Facebook Chat</strong> - Not sure if it is just gone, or not yet
    implemented, but I have used the integrated chat for a while and I will miss
    it if it is gone. </li><li><strong>Skype will not start</strong> - Not sure
    if it is because I changed my default Microsoft ID alias or if it is just a
    little flakie but it just exists when it tries to get my details.
    </li><li><strong>No Cortana </strong>- You can do some contortions with
    region and language to make it work. However who wants everything in
    American?</li></ul> </p><p><img title="clip_image005" style="border-top:
    0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px;

    src="http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/clip_image005.jpg"
    width="465" height="772"/> </p><p>For me the downsides are worth it and I
    love the new features and home screen. I <a
    href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WindowsPhone81HasMyAttentionNow.aspx"
    target="_blank">agree with Scott Hanselman</a> that this not only brings
    Windows Phone up to the level of iOS and Android but takes it beyond. 
    </p><p>Go on, get Windows Phone 8.1 Preview today and influence it.</p>
