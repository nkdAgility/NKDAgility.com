Just recently I have been doing a lot of work in Release Management 2013 and noticed the lack of documentation. I have done a number of installs and documented them is posts like [Installing Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2013](http://nkdagility.com/installing-release-management-client-visual-studio-2013/ "Installing Release Management Client for Visual Studio 2013") and [Installing Release Management Server for TFS 2013](http://nkdagility.com/installing-release-management-server-tfs-2013/ "http://nkdagility.com/installing-release-management-server-tfs-2013/") however there is always things that donâ€™t quite join up. I often have to head off an fix problems or get support as part of my posts an while I almost always blog those issues there is no joined up experience.
