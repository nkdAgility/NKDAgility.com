  - "<p>It had been a while since I installed TFS from scratch and I had a few questions from a customer on the subject. So instead of creating yet another installing TFS post I decided to create a couple of videos instead.</p>\r\n<p>In the first video I used the Basic Install option. This installs TFS with SQL Express and is the easiest setup. Instead of having to do a bunch of manual steps you just click and go. Fully configured TFS in no time. On top of that it will even configure SharePoint Foundation 2013 for you (not supported on Server 2012 R2 until SP1.) The only thing that you are missing is Reporting and that is only because SQL Express does not support Reporting Services or Analysis Services. You can however upgrade later if you feel the need easily.</p>\r\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7wIQk1pus0]<br /><small>Figure: Install &amp; Configure 101 - TFS 2013 Basic Installation</small></p>\r\n<p>If that's not for you and you like things a little bit more complicated you can install SQL Server first and then use the Standard Single Server install. Here I install SQL Server 2012 with all of the trimmings, Reporting and Analysis Services. I then let TFS do all of the heavy lifting of configuration and setup of all of the features. This results in a full install of TFS with a Cube and Data Warehouse but no SharePoint as it is not supported on Server 2012 R2 until the release of SharePoint 2013 SP1.</p>\r\n<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U69JMzIZXro]<br /><small>Figure: Install &amp; Configure 101 - TFS 2013 Standard Single Server Install</small></p>\r\n<p>This should give you some idea on how to install and configure TFS and how easy it is. Managing TFS is mostly, apart from configuring a backup, a leave alone statement. It mostly manages and maintains itself until you get to large database sizes. And by large I mean terabytes :)</p>\r\n<p>How did you get on with your TFS installs?</p>"

    Installing TFS 2013 from scratch is easy and take only minutes, even for an
    advanced install. See Martin show both a Basic and Standard Single Server
    install within an Active Directory domain.

      Martin,


      I'm trying to follow your second video.  I'm unable to add a TFS Service
      to the SQL server list of admins.  Can you help with this?

      Did you create an AD service account called yourdomainTFService? Once
      created you should be able to add it with 'SysAdmin' permission to your
      SQL Server instance...


      To be honest as long as your account has 'SysAdmin' when you run the TFS
      install it will fix everything up for you. What is the error message that
      you are getting?

      Thanks for the reply.  I got it sorted out.  It was an issue outside the
      scope of TFS.  Quick follow up question though.  Is it possible to change
      the url of the TFS server during a TFS express install?  During the
      configuration phase I see the option but it's grayed out as
      \[serverName]tfsDefaultCollection.  It's been requested that I change the
      url for this express instance so no one confuses it with the standard.  If
      I just change the url in TFS it can't connect.  Is this soemthing that
      needs to be done in the SQL Express server?  Sorry for asking such
      seemingly basic questions, this is my first TFS stand up.

      You can change both the URL and the collection name afterwards. Note that
      you can't install two TFS instances on the same server so you should not
      get them mixed up. If you want to configure this as part of the
      installation you can use the advanced wizard and specify everything...
      basic is well... basic. :)

      Martin I stumbled onto your blog and really enjoy your posts.  Did you
      have any thoughts on if it's worth upgrading TFS from 2012 to 2013?  I
      don't use the build feature at the moment of TFS and was wondering if
      outside of that there was anything that made it worth the upgrade.

      I do. I have a post on the features I like
      (http://nkdagility.com/get-visual-studio-2013-team-foundation-server-while-its-hot/)
      and none of them are build :). After I wrote that post Microsoft announced
      Release Management which then became my favourite feature. Indeed if you
      are going to 2013 you wold go to 2013.2 and there were a whole bunch of
      new features (http://nkdagility.com/upgrade-tfs-2013-update-2/) and
      refinements that are reasons to move. Go for it... you will not be unhappy
      :)

      I am looking at these links now, thank you for a quick reply!  If I have
      2012.2 and decide to do an in-place upgrade I shouldn't have any issues. 
      I don't have a ton of projects in place but I do have some code in there,
      just easier to do an in place upgrade then a clean install.  Man looking
      at some if these features I see that I am not using it to it's full
      potential!


      EDIT just saw this in your post...

      "I have already done one upgrade of a customers two terabyte TFS 2012
      instance with no issues and I am hopefully working on my next one as you
      read this… Download, install &amp; Play… be a kid again with Team
      Foundation Server 2013."


      Do you have a good explanation how to migrate my source control from 2012
      to 2013 without a inplace upgrade?  I am thinking that I might go to 2012
      R2 as my instance is just 2012 standard....thoughts or a link?

      :) Many folks are not using it to its full potential. I spend a lot of
      time onsite with customers just doing overviews of the features that come
      out-of-the-box let alond the deep advances bits. :) You are not alone...
