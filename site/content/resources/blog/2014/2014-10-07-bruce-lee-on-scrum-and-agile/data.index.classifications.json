However, it lacks direct discussions on competence, continuous learning, or skill development. While it touches on principles that could relate to competence, such as mastery and adaptability, these concepts are not explored in depth or explicitly tied to the core themes of competence as defined in the category. The overall focus is more on philosophy than on the practical aspects of competence in Agile and DevOps.",

However, it does not explicitly mention Agentic Agility or its key principles. While there are elements of autonomy and adaptability, the discussion lacks depth in exploring the intentional shaping of outcomes or the distinction between human and AI capabilities. Overall, the content is more about Agile practices than the specific concept of Agentic Agility.",
