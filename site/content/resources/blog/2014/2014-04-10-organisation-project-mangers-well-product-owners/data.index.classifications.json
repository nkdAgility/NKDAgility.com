It touches on key Scrum principles such as the importance of having a single Product Owner to avoid confusion and context switching, which aligns with the Scrum framework's emphasis on team dynamics and accountability. However, while it mentions Scrum-related roles, it does not delve deeply into the Scrum events or artifacts, which slightly lowers the depth score. Overall, the content is primarily focused on Scrum-related issues, justifying a high confidence score.",
