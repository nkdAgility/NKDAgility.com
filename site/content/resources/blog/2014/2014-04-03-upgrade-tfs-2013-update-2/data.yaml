  - "<p class=\"lead\">With the launch at Build of Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 2 I wanted to make sure that the update goes seamlessly. So I am upgrading my demo box to both <a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/upgrade-server-windows-server-2012-r2-update-1/\">Windows Server 2012 R2 Update 1</a> and Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 2. </p>\r\n<p>Recently the TFS updates have become so run of the mill that it has not been worth talking about updates. I don’t mean that the features added as part of the update are simple, it is that the install and upgrade process is so straightforward that it is a non-event. I have customers that are on some of the craziest domain and network configurations that I have ever seen and still TFS is the one system that cuts through the complexity and delivers a flawless experience. But why would I take even this non-existent risk… one word… features:</p>\r\n<h2>Backlog Management features in TFS 2013 Update 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to general performance and navigation improvements the TFS team has been hard at work adding value to our backlog management.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>REST API for Tags</strong> - I don't know how many times recently I have done either Integration Platform or even simple Excel migration of work items and hear the fateful words \"but where did my tags go?\". Now with Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 2 the TFS team have finally finished off tagging with an API that allows editing and management of Tags. You can now edit tags in Excel as well as through the API. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Query on Tags</strong> - With the addition of the API is now possible to create queries that target the tags. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Tagging in Visual Studio</strong> - You can apply tags to work items in Visual Studio. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Tagging Permissions</strong> - You can apply permissions for who can add new tags </li>\r\n<li><strong>Non-working days</strong> - You can configure non-working days, and these are excluded from burndown charts </li>\r\n<li><strong>Cumulative Flow Start Date</strong> - Cumulative Flow Diagram start dates are configurable </li>\r\n<li><strong>Pinning Charts</strong> - Lightweight charts can be pinned to project or team homepages</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These changes while small are things that my current customers have been clamouring for. Unfortunately they are stuck on IE8 and thus TFS 2012 is the most recent version that they can use.</p>\r\n<h2>Test Management features in TFS 2013 Update 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While I go head to head with the Test team often (sorry Ravi), I only do so because I love the tools and I want them to be better. Don't tell them that they make the competition look like a bunch of bumbling buffoons who could not test their way out of a paper bag.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Test Export</strong> - This update provides to testers and test leads the ability to export test artefacts so that these can be sent by using email or as printouts and shared with stakeholders who do not have access to TFS. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Shared Parameters</strong> - This update provides to testers and test leads the ability to manage test parameter data at one place by using Shared Parameters. Any subsequent changes to parameter data can be updated at one place and all the test cases referencing the Shared Parameter are automatically updated. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Where there are gaps in the tests tools Microsoft has many partners to step in and take up the slack by building against a world class API.</p>\r\n<h2>Release Management features in TFS 2013 Update 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Release management, while new to TFS, is an awesome tool and these additions go a long way to making it enterprise ready. I have been using it at a number of organisation and the clone deployment are probably the most powerful features. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Release Tags</strong> - The tags are designed to perform the same operation across the servers. If there are server specific actions, the user can always add the specific server and the corresponding actions at that level in the deployment sequence. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Shared Variables</strong> - To configure a group of server by using same tag implies that you can set values for the whole group and all the servers in the group therefore share common values for all variables. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Cluster Support</strong> - You can easily deploy to identical or clustered servers without having to repeat the deployment sequence on each server. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Clone deployment sequence</strong> - You can Copy Tags across stages and across Templates. You can retain the same deployment sequence with all the tags and servers when copied to other stages or Release templates under the same environment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I am looking forward to vNext and beyond in this space.</p>\r\n<h2>Version Management features in TFS 2013 Update 2</h2>\r\n<p>As predicted most of the enhancements are within the Git space. While TFVC will be around for a very long time to come I firmly believe that Git is the way forward for version control. If you are not thinking of moving to Git then I can assure you that your developers are. If you need any form of audit, common to any enterprise, then TFS is the ONLY implementation of Git that will support you.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>General Git additions</strong> - Git tools have been updated to include an annotate (blame) view, reverting a commit, amending a commit, pushing to multiple remotes, and improved progress and cancellation ability for long running operations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Updating to TFS 2013 Update 2</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As I said before the TFS install &amp; upgrades have become so trivial that it is almost not worth mentioning… almost… </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image2.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/><br />Figure: Upgrading to TFS 2013 Update 2 </p>\r\n<p>Upgrading TFS is simpley a case of installing the latest version. I would always recommend that you either take the opportunity to move to new hardware as this&nbsp; gives you the ultimate rollback. If you have a single server instance that is virtual you should at least ‘Snapshot’ the server. Whatever your quick rollback solution make sure, and I mean really sure, that you have a current and up to date backup. If you are using the TFS backup tool that is built into the new  </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image3.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"/><br />Figure: Laying down the new files </p>\r\n<p>The Installer will automatically remove the old version of TFS and update you to the latest bits. If you have TFS 2005 you will need to go to TFS 2010 first (you can get that installer from MSDN) but if you have 2008, 2010, or 2012 you can just run the 2013 Update 2 installer to upgrade. </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image4.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"/><br />Figure: Make really sure that you have a backup before upgrading to TFS 2013 Update 2 </p>\r\n<p>Once the foundation has been laid you will be presented with screen asking you which database (configuration database) that you want to upgrade. You may have more than one TFS instance using the same SQL Server. To be honest I would not recomnned it, but I have seen it. You will have to check the box to say that you really do have a backup, and if you do not then go now and create a SQL backup of all of the TFS databases. </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image5.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"460\"/><br />Figure: Review your upgrade to TFS 2013 Update 2 </p>\r\n<p>If you are upgrading you will probably not need to change any of the settings. In just hit ‘next’ until it asked me to re-enter the reporting account password an then reviewed the settings. If you are installing from scratch then you should hit the documenation, or a previous post for a full install guide.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a title=\"http://nkdagility.com/installing-tfs-2013-scratch-easy/\" href=\"http://nkdagility.com/installing-tfs-2013-scratch-easy/\">Installing TFS 2013 from scratch is easy</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>After this you validate and then execute the configuration. After a while, say 5-10 minutes, you will see a bunch of green checkmarks. If you are upgrading from TFS 2008 or TFS 2010 you may have a much longer wait. Depending on the size of your database and the speed of the servers you upgrade could take minutes or hours. </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image6.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/><br />Figure: All green ticks when upgrading to TFS 2013 Update 2 </p>\r\n<p>Not only did I get green ticks on the configuration, but you will get ticks for each of your collections. Even after the configuration has completed your collection updates will kick off in the background. My current customer has more than 10 collections and these will be upgraded individually. Once done you collections will be online and you can connect… </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"image\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px\" border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image7.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\"/><br />Figure: Only 13 minutes to upgrade to TFS 2013 Update 2 </p>\r\n<p>In only 13 minutes I have upgrade my demo environment from TFS 2013 RTM to TFS 2013 Update 2. This was a small environment however the process is the same regardless.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While a full list of features in both Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server for Update 2 can be found on <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2927432\">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2927432</a> the ones above are those that I think are most important and relevant for ALM. I am really looking forward to some of the features that I know are coming in the next version of TFS and these are just wetting our appetites and rounding out some of the itches that we have right now. At this time TFS 2013 Update 2 has RTM’ed however Visual Studio and some of the other update components are still RC. That said, they are coming with a go-live licence. </p>\r\n<p><b>Released to Manufacture (RTM): </b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>TFS 2013 Update 2 RTM: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392762\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392762</a> </li>\r\n<li>TFS Express Update 2 RTM: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392763\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392763</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Go-Live Release Candidate:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>VS 2013 Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=390521\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=390521</a> </li>\r\n<li>Express for Windows Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=386598\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=386598</a> </li>\r\n<li>Ultimate Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331030\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331030</a> </li>\r\n<li>Professional Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331031\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331031</a> </li>\r\n<li>Premium Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331032\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=331032</a> </li>\r\n<li>Agents Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393087\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393087</a> </li>\r\n<li>Release Management Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393085\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393085</a> </li>\r\n<li>Remote Tools Update 2 RC: <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393086\">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=393086</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For those that do not know what Go-Live is it means that the TFS team are happy to fully support its use in production but they don’t guarantee beyond RC quality.

Don;t be afraid of Go-Live… embrace it and go for it.</p>\r\n<p>You should go ahead and install TSF 2013 Update 2 today. If you have any issues or you want to know more about how to make the most of the new and existing features then give us a shout.</p>"

      You can't do an in-place conversion but you can migrate to a new project.
      You can move work items using the TFS IP and Source using
      (http://nkdagility.com/migrating-source-code-with-history-to-tfs-2012-with-git-tf/)

      Not, I think, the answer that you want... but it does get you there.

      Thanks for the great walkthrough. Interesting mention of GIT tools - I
      don't expect my team will need it for a while but I'll have to read up
      more about TFS GIT integration in my spare time :-).


      Hardware migration from TFS2010sp1 to TFS2013u2 by just moving TPC DB?


      Context: For upgrade I have a new hardware destination. Since my team is
      not using SharePoint integration I have been told I can simply copy the
      75GB(!) TFS TPC (Team Project Collection) database .mdf file to the new
      TFS2013 server, then add it using TFS Admin console. VS2013 should upgrade
      then host the TPC. I might need to first restamp the SQL DB so it won't
      get confused with the original, but most users will be completely cut
      over. (We'll be pruning (tf obliterate) many dead branches after upgrade
      so the original DB will be kept for archive.)


      I know your instructions typically bring the TFS Configuration DB and all
      other DBs to the new server (except warehouse DB which gets rebuilt). My
      question is if TFS Web Access, SharePoint, Reporting Server, Warehouse,
      backup wizard target path/account, etc. will all be reconfigured in new
      hosted location is it really beneficial to also bring the old config (and
      other files) over?

      You should move over the whole thing. Reporting, Warehouse, Configuration,
      and collections. Once over you should also call ChangeServerId on the OLD
      instance if you think that some folks would continue to connect there for
      some reason. If you don't their clients will get all confused...

      Daniel, that will not bring over your reporting services reports and you
      will have to run a command line to regenerate them per team project. If
      you have one TP then ok, but if you have 200 not so much. In addition
      rebuilding the data warehouse and cube for a large collection or
      multi-collection system will take your reporting infrastructure down for
      many hours (as many as 8+). You should always upgrade the system as a
      whole if you can.

      Martin, you don't talk about build servers in the post. Should I upgrade
      each Team Build instance to Update 2?

      Thanks Martin. Because an updated agent need to have it's local version of
      VS 2013 updated to Update 2 RC (as stated in Brian Harry's post
      http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/04/02/tfs-2013-2-update-2-released.aspx),
      I'm probably going to wait for VS 2013 Update 2 RTM to be released before
      I update the agents.

      Hi Martin, could you confirm the upgrade process from RM 2013 Update 1 to
      RM 2013 Update 2 please? Do we really have to uninstall everything?

      Not sure that I understand: In the detail above you can see that I just
      run the installer for Update 2 and it takes care of everything.

      Apologies for not being clearer Martin - I was referring to Release
      Management rather than TFS itself. If I understand correctly RM is a
      separate upgrade, ie the TFS upgrade process doesn't upgrade RM? When I
      run the RM 2013 Update 2 server installer (from my MSDN subscription)
      against RM 2013 Update 1 I get a "One or more Release Management for
      Visual Studio 2013 or earlier products are installed. Please uninstall
      these prior to installing Release Management Server for Team Foundation
      Server 2013" message. As far as I can tell the official documentation
      doesn't deal with upgrading from Update 1 to Update 2, only on an initial
      install. Thanks for your help!

      I would expect this to be changed in a future update. However all the TFS
      installer does is chain the same process of uninstalling the old one an
      installing the new one. All of the data is the same and everything is
      stored in the database.

      Thanks for that Martin. For anyone else with the same query, uninstalling
      RM and reinstalling again is a bit of a pain (as the server, clients and
      agents all need updating), but settings are preserved. The one that might
      catch people out is that (for me at least) the server was set to https on
      upgrading even though it wasn't initially.

      Hi Martin,

      Thanks for this interesting article.  I have upgraded my TFS 2013 instance
      to TFS 2013 Update 2, following the instructions you gave.  Everything
      works well.  I have the following question:


      How to "patch" TFS reporting/ analysis DBs when migrating TFS 2010 Team
      collections to an existing TFS 2013 Update 2 instance?


      More context about the question:

      My TFS 2013 Update 2 now contains a snapshot data resulted from the
      migration TFS 2010 to TFS 2013 that I have done for Acceptance test.

      Since I have already a working instance TFS 2013 update 2, can I just move
      the Team Project Collections from TFS 2010 to the new hardware with TFS
      2013 Update 2 ready for production?  I have tested the individual
      migration for one collection from TFS 2010 to TFS 2013, it works, but I am
      not sure what to do with the reporting DBs like ReportServer,
      Tfs_WareHouse.  For the SharePoint part, I understand that I have to
      Mount-SPContentDatabase with powershell, but for Reporting and Analysis
      DBs, I am a bit confuse what I should do, when we upgrade Team Project
      Collections incrementally, instead of doing an entire migration to new
      hardware as described in many article.


      Could you please advice on this?

      You can either start from scratch (using the tfconfig setup
      /uninstall:all) or you can create new reports using tfpt addreports
      command.
