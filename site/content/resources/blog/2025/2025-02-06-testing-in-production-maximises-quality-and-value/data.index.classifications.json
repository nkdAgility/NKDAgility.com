However, while it touches on aspects of value delivery and the importance of telemetry for maximising ROI, it does not explicitly define or measure Current Value as outlined in the category description. The focus is more on deployment strategies rather than a comprehensive analysis of Current Value metrics or their role in decision-making, which limits its alignment with the category.",
