Ultimately, the Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team's success. This includes product delivery, product success, Sprint outcomes, the team's ability, and ensuring the team has the resources, skills, and ethos needed to succeed. While the entire Scrum Team shares accountability for delivery, the Scrum Master’s role is to create the conditions for effective delivery and continuous improvement. Delivery is the minimum bar for effectiveness—without it, the team cannot measure or realise value. Without delivery, there is no increment, no feedback, and no way to empirically assess value. A Scrum Team that delivers without value is ineffective but still functional. A Scrum Team that fails to deliver anything cannot be considered effective under any measure.

> Let the record show that I believe that, if you’re in the kind of organisation that will still fund Scrum Masters despite a long-in-the-tooth Scrum adoption, then you can bet your ass the Scrum Master is accountable for delivery. That’s because they should be facilitating the “aha” moments required of the team to address things like capacity, understanding, and level-setting with product and stakeholders when goals are just too big or infeasible.

Scrum Masters should embrace their accountability for creating an environment where delivery is not just possible but inevitable. Effectiveness begins with delivery—then expands to encompass value, learning, and continuous improvement. This dual focus ensures that the Scrum Team not only meets the minimum bar but thrives well beyond it.

## The Scrum Master is accountable for Delivery

The success of a Scrum Team begins with their accountability for delivering a usable, working product at the end of every sprint—including the very first one. This principle is the backbone of Scrum's empirical process, ensuring the team generates valuable feedback for continuous improvement of their product and the system. A working increment is non-negotiable; without it, there’s no way to inspect and adapt effectively or measure progress towards the team's goals. By focusing on delivery as the minimum bar for effectiveness, the Scrum Team builds a foundation that doesn’t just deliver but delivers value consistently.

Effectiveness is More Than Delivery, but Delivery is a Minimum.

### **The accountability of the Scrum Master for delivery**

At the heart of this framework lies the Scrum Master, who holds a pivotal accountability: enabling an environment where delivery becomes not just possible but inevitable. This accountability isn’t about executing the work but ensuring the team has the resources, strategies, and support needed to thrive.

The Scrum Master is accountable for the effectiveness of the Scrum Team, and to achieve that, they need to have a level of authority that fits the context of the Scrum Team and the organisation. Ideally, they can pursue this accountability using influence and leadership, but in many organisations, this is impossible without an appropriate level of authority.

Can a Scrum team be considered effective if they don't deliver? The Scrum Master is accountable for the team’s culture and its collective ability to effectively deliver value each and every Sprint. If they fail to fulfil that accountability through the inability of the Scrum Team to deliver value, then they should be held accountable for that failure by the business. The Scrum Guide makes it clear that the Scrum Master’s accountability for the team's effectiveness inherently ties to delivery, as the production of a usable increment every sprint is the foundational measure of a team’s success. The business holding the Scrum Master accountable for delivery in no way dilutes the collective accountability of the Scrum Team; instead, it reinforces the importance of every team member’s role in achieving this shared goal.

It's entirely likely that [your next Scrum Master will be your manager](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/your-next-scrum-master-should-be-your-manager).

## **But what about the Scrum Team’s Shared Accountability for Delivery?**

The [Scrum Guide (2020)]({{< ref "/resources/guides/scrum-guide" >}}) makes it clear: the entire Scrum Team is accountable for delivering a valuable, useful increment every sprint. That said, while delivery is a collective responsibility, the role of the Scrum Master has a unique slant: they are not _players_ on the field but the _coach_. Their accountability lies in fostering an environment where effective delivery can happen consistently.

Using a football analogy, the coach is ultimately held accountable for the team’s performance. They are responsible for strategy, facilitation, and ensuring the team has the resources and focus needed to succeed. The players, however, still own the execution. In Scrum, the Scrum Master is similarly accountable for enabling outcomes—not by doing the work themselves but by ensuring that the Scrum framework is effectively applied and the team functions optimally.

While the entire Scrum Team is accountable for delivery, the Scrum Master ensures the conditions for success by addressing systemic issues and empowering the team to work efficiently.

## **Effectiveness Beyond Delivery**

Effectiveness in a Scrum context spans far beyond simply delivering increments of software. However, let’s be clear: delivery is the baseline. Without delivery, the concept of effectiveness becomes moot. As I often say, “Effectiveness starts with delivery.” From there, we can layer on concepts like:

1. **Delivering Meaningful Value:** Effectiveness isn’t about shipping anything and everything in the backlog. It’s about delivering increments that provide tangible value to the customer and the organisation. Efficiency doesn’t mean you’re effectively delivering meaningful and impactful things.

2. **Maximising Value While Minimising Waste:** A truly effective team doesn’t just execute orders. They challenge assumptions, reduce unnecessary work, and focus on outcomes, not output. Scrum Masters facilitate this by fostering a culture of curiosity and continuous improvement.

3. **Empowering Autonomous Teams:** The hallmark of an effective Scrum Master is the ability to cultivate a team that self-manages and self-optimises. This requires creating psychological safety, enabling conflict resolution, and empowering the team to make decisions.

4. **Collaborating with Adjacent Teams:** Effective Scrum Masters actively work with and enable adjacent teams to align efforts, remove cross-team dependencies, and foster organisational coherence. By promoting collaboration across teams, they ensure a seamless flow of value delivery across the organisation.

5. **Fulfilling Organisational Accountability:** The Scrum Master has an accountability to the organisation beyond the team. This involves educating leadership about Scrum, advocating for systemic improvements, and helping the organisation embrace new ways of working. By bridging the team and the broader organisation, Scrum Masters enhance alignment and drive strategic value.

## **Why Delivery Is the Minimum Bar**

Here’s the reality: without delivery, there is no effectiveness to measure. Consider the [Agile Manifesto’s]({{< ref "/resources/guides/manifesto-for-agile-software-development" >}}) first principle: _"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."_ Delivery is not the _end-all-be-all_, but it is the minimum bar of competence for a Scrum Team. A team that consistently fails to deliver usable increments cannot claim to be effective, no matter how skilled or engaged they are.

Although from a single instance, this quote embodies the common failure of Scrum Teams to even meet this minimum bar:

> The code that was done never arrived at production, nor did it come close to meeting DoD's requirements, and by most standards, we did not deliver anything.

While the team may have contributed to organisational learning or questioned the value of a particular initiative, their inability to deliver working software regularly is antithetical to Scrum. Cancelled sprints or pivots in direction are valid within the framework, but they do not negate the fundamental expectation: each sprint ends with a usable increment.

Effectiveness requires delivery, but delivery itself is not the sole measure of effectiveness. It is, however, the critical foundation. A football team that consistently fails to score cannot be described as effective, no matter how skilled its players may be.

## **The Scrum Master’s Accountability in Delivery**

The Scrum Master is a lean-agile practitioner with technical mastery, business mastery, and organisational evolutionary mastery that can provide training, coaching, & mentoring as needed within the context of the team, the product, and the organisation. This is [not an entry-level position but represents an experienced product professional]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2021/2021-03-15-hiring-a-professional-scrum-master" >}}) who can enable the whole Scrum Team to take accountability for delivery by:

- **Ensuring Transparency:** Helping the team and stakeholders maintain clarity on progress, impediments, and value delivery through well-facilitated events and effective artefacts.
- **Removing Impediments:** Proactively identifying and enabling the removal of blockers that hinder the team’s ability to deliver.
- **Enabling Technical Excellence:** The Scrum Master should have [sufficient technical skills within the Scrum Teams' work context]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2019/2019-09-01-are-technical-skills-required-to-be-a-scrum-master" >}}) to advocate for and enable practices like design patterns, Test-Driven Development (TDD), automated testing, and continuous integration—all of which are critical for sustainable delivery. Great Scrum Masters will also be able to teach these techniques.
- **Facilitating Empiricism:** Supporting the team in working empirically by fostering a cadence of inspect and adapt cycles, ensuring that learning is continuously integrated into delivery.

When delivery falters, stakeholders naturally look to the Scrum Master to understand and address the root causes. By taking ownership of systemic issues and facilitating improvements, the Scrum Master ensures the team’s consistent ability to deliver effectively.

They take accountability for delivery!
