It explicitly mentions the importance of delivery as a measure of effectiveness and ties it to the Scrum framework, indicating a clear understanding of how delivery relates to value realisation. However, while it touches on the concept of value, it does not delve deeply into specific metrics or techniques for measuring Current Value, which slightly limits its depth of discussion. Overall, the content aligns well with the themes of Current Value, but it lacks comprehensive exploration of metrics and practical applications.",
