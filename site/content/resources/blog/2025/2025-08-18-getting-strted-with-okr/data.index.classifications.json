While these topics are relevant to agile and iterative product management, the explicit focus on product discovery methodologies—such as user research, customer feedback analysis, prototyping, MVPs, or frameworks like Lean Startup and Design Thinking—is minimal. The content briefly touches on user feedback and adapting requirements based on learning, which aligns conceptually with product discovery. However, the main emphasis is on strategic alignment, organisational culture, and execution practices rather than explicitly exploring customer needs identification or feature validation. Therefore, the mentions score is low due to minimal explicit references to product discovery. Conceptual alignment and intent scores are moderate, as the content indirectly supports discovery principles through iterative learning and adaptation. Depth is limited since the content does not substantially explore discovery-specific methodologies or practices. Audience alignment is relatively high, as the intended audience (agile practitioners, product leaders) overlaps significantly with those interested in product discovery. Signal-to-noise ratio is moderate, as the content is focused but not directly on product discovery topics. No penalties were applied as the content is current and does not contradict the category framing.",
