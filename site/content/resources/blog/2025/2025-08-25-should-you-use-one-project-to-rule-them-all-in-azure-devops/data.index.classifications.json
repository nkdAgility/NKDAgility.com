    "ai_penalty_details": "alignment: -1 (focus on tooling/config, little integration with agentic or autonomous AI concepts); intent: -0.5 (purpose does not meaningfully support or discuss agentic delivery)",
    "final_score": 19.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses on Azure DevOps project configuration, flow, governance, and team collaboration, but does not mention or substantively align with agentic software delivery concepts. There are no direct mentions or meaningful exploration of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or human-AI integration. Discussion centers on operational structure, not agentic principles, so fit is weak. Penalties applied to alignment (predominant DevOps tooling/process, lacks agentic framing) and intent (tangential to agentic delivery). Audience is technical, partially overlapping with agentic software delivery's, but the topic is conventional team/project admin. Signal-to-noise is moderate, as little content addresses the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is centered on Azure DevOps project structure, not agentic software delivery. No direct or substantial exploration of autonomous agents, contextual AI, or synergistic human-AI delivery. Minimal category fit; confidence is low.",
    "level": "Ignored"
