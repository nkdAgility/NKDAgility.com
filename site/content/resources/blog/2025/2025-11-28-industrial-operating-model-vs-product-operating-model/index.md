short_title: Industrial vs Product Operating Models
description: Explores why the Industrial Operating Model, rooted in Taylorism and command-and-control, fails in dynamic markets, and how the Product Operating Model enables organisations to thrive through empiricism, decentralization, and continuous adaptation.
tldr: The Industrial Operating Model, designed for stable markets with predictable demand, becomes a source of waste and dysfunction in today's dynamic markets. Organizations must transition to the Product Operating Model—characterized by empiricism, decentralized decision-making, cross-functional teams, and fast feedback loops—to deliver value effectively. Without continuous operating-model hygiene, organisations naturally regress to familiar hierarchical patterns.

Most organisations today operate under an Industrial Operating Model while competing in dynamic markets. This fundamental mismatch creates enormous waste, missed opportunities, and frustrated teams. Understanding why this model fails—and what must replace it—is essential for any organisation seeking to deliver value effectively in the 21st century.

## Defining the Two Operating Models

Before we explore why organisations struggle, we must clearly define the two operating models at the heart of this discussion.

**The Industrial Operating Model** is rooted in Taylorism and scientific management principles. It emerged during the Industrial Age to optimize predictable, repetitive manufacturing work. This model is characterized by command-and-control structures, hierarchical decision-making, predictive planning with fixed scope and resources, and output-focused measurement. Work is separated into specialized functions, with planning happening separately from execution. Management controls through detailed processes, sign-offs, and individual accountability.

**The Product Operating Model** is organized around continuous value delivery, empiricism, and outcome-based measurement. It structures persistent cross-functional teams around products or value streams. Decision-making authority is distributed to those closest to the work. Success is measured by outcomes and customer impact, not outputs and activity. The model relies on transparency, inspection, and adaptation—the three pillars of empirical process control—supported by fast feedback loops and technical excellence.

These are not simply different management styles. They are fundamentally different systems designed for different contexts.

## The Industrial Operating Model Was Fit for Stable Markets

The Industrial Operating Model was not a mistake. It was brilliantly designed for its context.

During the Industrial Age, markets were stable and predictable. Demand grew steadily over long periods. Competition was limited. Products had decades-long lifecycles. In textiles, steel production, and large-scale manufacturing, success came from optimizing efficiency and driving down costs through standardization and economies of scale.

Frederick Winslow Taylor developed scientific management for exactly this environment. When work is repetitive and predictable, breaking it into specialized tasks and optimizing each step makes sense. When markets change slowly, detailed upfront planning works. When products remain unchanged for years, separation of planning from execution causes minimal waste.

The Industrial Operating Model delivered extraordinary results in stable markets. It built railways, scaled factories, and powered economic growth throughout the 20th century. The model succeeded because it matched its context: predictable work in predictable markets.

## Why the Industrial Operating Model Fails in Dynamic Markets

Markets began shifting toward complexity and volatility in the mid-20th century. The pace accelerated dramatically in the 1970s with the microprocessor revolution. By the 1990s, the internet had fundamentally changed how quickly ideas spread and how rapidly markets evolve.

Today, most markets are dynamic. Customer needs change rapidly. Technology enables new competitors to emerge quickly. Product lifecycles measure in months, not decades. Uncertainty is the norm, not the exception.

The Industrial Operating Model generates massive waste in this context.

**Planning waste** emerges when organisations invest months creating detailed plans that become obsolete within weeks. Requirements gathered at the start of a project no longer reflect market reality by the time delivery begins. Change control boards slow response to learning, turning agility into a bureaucratic exercise.

**Decision-making waste** occurs when hierarchical approval chains delay action. By the time a decision escalates through management layers, the information is stale and the opportunity has passed. Teams closest to customers lack authority to respond to what they learn.

**Innovation waste** happens when rigid processes and risk-averse cultures kill experimentation. Ideas must fit into predetermined roadmaps. Small experiments that could provide fast feedback are blocked by governance processes designed for large capital investments. Teams cannot explore what customers actually need.

**Human potential waste** is perhaps the most painful. Talented people are treated as interchangeable resources, assigned to projects based on availability rather than capability or interest. Individual utilization metrics drive behaviors that undermine team collaboration. Separation of planning from execution means those doing the work cannot apply their insight to improve it.

**Market disconnect waste** grows as organisations become insulated from customer reality. Layers of management separate decision-makers from actual users. Success is measured by delivery of planned outputs, regardless of whether those outputs create value. Teams ship what was specified months ago, not what customers need today.

The Industrial Operating Model operates at fundamentally the wrong speed for dynamic markets. While the market iterates daily, the organisation plans quarterly or annually. While customer needs evolve continuously, the organisation delivers in large batches after months of work. This speed mismatch is not a minor friction—it is a structural incompatibility.

## The Product Operating Model Enables Success in Dynamic Markets

The Product Operating Model structures organisations for speed, learning, and adaptation.

At its foundation lies **empiricism**: the practice of making decisions based on observation and experiment rather than prediction and assumption. Scrum, as a social technology, makes work transparent, creates regular inspection points, and enables rapid adaptation based on what is learned. Kanban, as an observability pattern, makes workflow visible and measures actual delivery performance, enabling teams to see and improve their systems.

**Decentralization** is essential, not optional. Mary Parker Follett recognized nearly a century ago that effective organisations distribute authority to where knowledge resides. In dynamic markets, that knowledge lives with teams close to customers and technology, not with executives insulated from both. Decentralization enables fast decisions based on current information. It eliminates escalation delays and management bottlenecks that plague hierarchical structures.

**Cross-functional, persistent teams** form the organisational structure. Each team possesses all skills needed to deliver value without dependencies on other teams or handoffs to specialized functions. Teams stay together over time, building deep capability and psychological safety. They own outcomes—customer value and business impact—not just outputs like features or story points.

**Fast feedback loops** replace predictive planning. Teams deliver working software frequently—ideally continuously—and observe real customer behavior. Product Owners make decisions based on actual usage data and customer feedback rather than assumptions documented months earlier. Sprint Goals provide coherence and focus while allowing teams to adapt their approach as they learn. Service Level Expectations establish predictable flow without requiring detailed estimates.

**Technical excellence** is mandatory, not aspirational. Teams must practice Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery as Kent Beck and Jez Humble have taught us. Automated testing provides the safety to move quickly. Infrastructure as Code enables rapid provisioning and recovery. Monitoring and observability reveal how systems behave in production. These practices are not tools or processes—they embody a DevOps ethos that breaks down barriers between building and operating software.

The Product Operating Model matches the speed and uncertainty of dynamic markets. It structures organisations to learn and adapt continuously rather than predict and control.

## Operating-Model Hygiene: Why Organizations Regress

Many organisations transition away from hierarchical structures only to drift back over time. Start-ups begin as nimble network organisations with direct communication and fast decisions. As they grow, departments emerge. Managers accumulate authority. Planning processes formalize. Approval chains lengthen. Within a few years, the organisation has recreated the Industrial Operating Model.

This regression is predictable. The Industrial Operating Model is familiar. Most leaders experienced it throughout their careers. Under pressure, people default to known patterns. When faced with coordination challenges, the instinct is to add management layers. When facing uncertainty, the reflex is to demand more detailed plans.

Organizations build up what we might call **operating-model cruft**—accumulated structures, processes, and behaviors that no longer serve the current context but resist removal. A new approval process gets added to prevent a single failure. It never gets removed when the risk passes. A management layer forms to coordinate between teams. It persists even after teams become more self-sufficient. Individual performance reviews drive behaviors that undermine team collaboration, but changing them feels too risky.

Without deliberate **operating-model hygiene**—the continuous practice of examining and removing organisational structures, processes, and behaviors that no longer serve their purpose—organisations inevitably regress. This hygiene means regularly asking: Does this still serve us? Does this enable or impede fast feedback? Does this distribute authority or concentrate it? Does this build team capability or create dependencies?

Operating-model hygiene requires **refactoring organisational structures** just as we refactor code. Remove processes that no longer serve their purpose. Eliminate management layers that have become bottlenecks. Disband cross-functional coordinating bodies that exist only because teams lack necessary skills. Challenge individual metrics that undermine collaboration.

This work never ends. Organizations exist in constant tension between forces that drive toward hierarchy and control and forces that enable distributed decision-making and adaptation. Without continuous effort to maintain the Product Operating Model, the Industrial Operating Model reasserts itself.

## Making the Transition

Transitioning from Industrial to Product Operating Model is not a simple process change. It requires fundamental shifts in structure, culture, measurement, and leadership.

**Structure must change** to persistent, cross-functional teams aligned to value streams or products. Functional departments become communities of practice rather than organisational silos. Project teams and resource pools must go—they are incompatible with the Product Operating Model.

**Measurement must change** from output to outcome. Evidence-Based Management provides the framework: Current Value, Unrealized Value, Time to Market, and Ability to Innovate. These measures focus on value delivery and system capability, not individual productivity or task completion. Velocity, utilization rates, and other behavior-distorting metrics must be abandoned.

**Leadership must change** from command-and-control to system stewardship. Leaders design systems that enable teams to succeed. They remove organisational impediments. They provide clarity through goals and constraints—Product Goals and Sprint Goals—while allowing teams autonomy in how they achieve them. Peter Drucker taught us that management is fundamentally about designing effective systems. Andy Grove showed us how leaders create leverage through system improvements rather than individual heroics.

**Culture must change** to support transparency, experimentation, and psychological safety. Teams must be able to surface problems without fear of blame. Failure in controlled experiments must be recognized as learning, not punished as incompetence. This cultural shift takes time and consistent leadership behavior.

Many organisations attempt these changes incrementally, hoping to avoid disruption. This rarely succeeds. The Industrial Operating Model is coherent—its pieces reinforce each other. Individual performance reviews support functional silos. Functional silos necessitate project structures. Project structures require resource allocation and individual utilization measurement. These elements form an interconnected system.

Changing one element while preserving others creates internal contradictions that prevent real transformation. Organizations end up with "Agile teams" reporting through hierarchical management structures, measured by industrial metrics, organized into temporary project assignments. This is not transition—it is the Industrial Operating Model with different terminology.

Effective transition requires system-level change. The organisation must commit to restructuring around products, establishing cross-functional teams, shifting to outcome-based measurement, and supporting leaders who steward systems rather than control work. This takes months of focused effort, not years of gradual adjustment.

## Call to Action: Redesign Your Operating Model

If your organisation competes in dynamic markets—and most do—the Industrial Operating Model is costing you. Every day. Wasted effort. Missed opportunities. Frustrated teams. Lost customers.

The question is not whether to change, but how quickly you can change.

Start by acknowledging the mismatch. Your operating model was designed for different conditions. It is not bad—it is unfit for current context.

Commit to operating-model redesign built on the Product Operating Model. Structure persistent, cross-functional teams around value streams. Distribute decision-making authority to those teams. Measure outcomes and system capability, not outputs and individual activity. Develop leaders who design systems rather than control work.

Implement continuous operating-model hygiene. Regularly examine structures, processes, and behaviors. Remove what no longer serves. Challenge what creates dependencies or delays feedback. Resist the gravitational pull toward hierarchy and control.

This is not easy work. But it is necessary work. The Industrial Operating Model cannot deliver value effectively in dynamic markets. Organizations that complete this transition will thrive. Those that don't will continue generating waste while wondering why their "Agile transformation" failed.

The choice is yours: maintain operating-model practices designed for markets that no longer exist, or redesign your organisation for the reality you face today.
