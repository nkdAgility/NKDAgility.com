    "reasoning": "The content is a deep, practical exploration of the Definition of Done (DoD) within Scrum, focusing on quality, transparency, and continuous improvement. It references the Agile Manifesto and emphasises the importance of clear, objective standards for product increments. However, it does not directly mention the 'Agile Product Operating Model' (APOM) or explicitly discuss its principles, frameworks, or organisational shifts from project to product. The alignment is moderate: while the DoD is a key enabler of product quality and continuous delivery (which are APOM-aligned), the article is primarily about Scrum team practices rather than the broader operating model, governance, or organisational transformation. The depth is strong regarding DoD, but less so for APOM as a whole. The intent is to inform Scrum practitioners and leaders about quality and delivery, which partially overlaps with the APOM audience but is not fully targeted at those designing or implementing an operating model. The signal-to-noise ratio is high, with little off-topic content, and the audience is likely to include both practitioners and leaders, but not necessarily strategists or executives focused on operating model transformation. No penalties were applied, as the content is current, constructive, and not critical of APOM. The final confidence score reflects that while the content is highly relevant to agile product delivery and continuous improvement, it only partially and indirectly fits the APOM category.",
