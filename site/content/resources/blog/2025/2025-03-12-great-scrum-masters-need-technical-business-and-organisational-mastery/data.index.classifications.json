There is no reference to forecasted delivery times, probability-based timeframes, or predictability mechanisms (such as SLE provides). The alignment with SLE as defined is extremely limited—at best, the discussion of removing impediments or enabling effective delivery loosely touches on factors that impact overall team predictability, but does so only in general terms and never in the framing of SLE. The target audience (Scrum practitioners, agile coaches) overlaps, but the specific focus is generalized and never addresses SLE concepts. The content is highly focused on effective Scrum Master qualities and team enablement, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio in that domain, but almost no signal for SLE. No penalties are applied as the content is not outdated nor adversarial. Overall, there is virtually no basis for inclusion under Service Level Expectation using the strict classification criteria.",
