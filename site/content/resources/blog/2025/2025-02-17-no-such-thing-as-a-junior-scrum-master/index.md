# There Is No Such Thing as a “Junior” Scrum Master

The idea of a “junior” Scrum Master is a fallacy. The Scrum Master is not an entry-level position, nor is it something that should be handed out as a career stepping stone. A Scrum Master **should be born fully formed**, emerging from the Scrum Team as a practitioner who has already demonstrated technical mastery, business mastery, and organisational evolutionary mastery. They should be **elevated by the team, not assigned by management.**

## The Myth of the Junior Scrum Master

Too often, organisations treat the Scrum Master role as a checkbox on a hiring matrix, assuming that anyone can step in and “facilitate” a few events. This mindset reduces the Scrum Master to a glorified meeting scheduler rather than the steward of effectiveness that they are meant to be. The reality is this: **Scrum Masters are not made in a two-day certification course**—they are forged in the crucible of real-world experience within high-performing Scrum Teams.

This aligns with the points made in [The Incompetent Scrum Master]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2024/2024-09-05-the-incompetent-scrum-master-why-most-are-failing-and-what-they-should-know" >}}), which highlights that many Scrum Masters lack the depth of knowledge and experience necessary to be effective. The best Scrum Masters are not those who simply “get certified” but those who have lived and breathed Scrum within a team, demonstrating real-world competence before stepping into the role.

The best Scrum Masters:

- Have worked within a Scrum Team for years, developing their craft as a Developer, Product Owner, or another key role.
- Have demonstrated their ability not just to deliver work but to enable agility through lean thinking, continuous improvement, and servant leadership.
- Possess **technical mastery, business mastery, and organisational evolutionary mastery**—the three pillars of a truly competent Scrum Master.

## Scrum Masters Are Chosen by the Team, Not Imposed by Management

A Scrum Master should **not** be an external hire brought in to “fix” a team. Instead, they should **rise naturally from within the team**, selected by their peers who trust them to safeguard the team’s effectiveness.

This approach ensures:

- The Scrum Master has credibility within the team—they have already **earned the respect** of their colleagues.
- They understand the organisation’s constraints, culture, and history, enabling **meaningful change** without naive disruption.
- Their selection is based on demonstrated competence, not just theoretical knowledge or a certification.

If a team does not trust or respect their Scrum Master, they won’t follow them. The Scrum Master must be someone who has already shown leadership, not someone who needs to “grow into the role.”

## The Accountability of the Scrum Master Is Heavy—And It Requires Mastery

Scrum Masters, as all leaders, **should not lead only through authority**—they should lead through influence. That influence comes from **mastery of three key domains**:

1. **Technical Mastery** – A deep understanding of software development, DevOps, modern engineering practices, and the realities of delivering high-quality products. This doesn’t mean they have to code daily, but they must understand how technical decisions impact agility.
2. **Business Mastery** – The ability to align Scrum Teams with the broader business strategy, ensuring that the work they facilitate delivers real, measurable value. This does not take away from the Product Owner but instead supports it.
3. **Organisational Evolutionary Mastery** – The skill to enable systemic change, remove organisational impediments, and cultivate a culture of agility **beyond the team level**.

While Scrum Masters should lead through influence and servant leadership, they are not powerless. The concept of intent-based leadership—where they also hold authority—can be incredibly effective. The best Scrum Masters [know when to serve and when to step up with authority](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/your-next-scrum-master-should-be-your-manager) to drive change. They wield the accountability of the role not just as a facilitator but as a true leader, ensuring that agility is not merely an aspiration but a reality.

This concept is further reinforced in [The Scrum Master is Accountable for Delivery]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2025/2025-01-30-the-scrum-master-is-accountable-for-delivery" >}}), which highlights how Scrum Masters must take ownership of delivery effectiveness and drive the team towards meaningful outcomes. Does this still sound like a junior position?

## Scrum Masters Should Wield Their Accountability with Competence from Day One

The idea that a Scrum Master should “learn on the job” is dangerous. A Scrum Master **should be able to step into the role with full competency from day one**, because they have already been functioning as a de facto Scrum Master within their team before ever taking on the title.

This is not about gatekeeping—it’s about effectiveness. If a Scrum Master is learning the fundamentals while on the job, they are **not serving the team—they are hindering it**.

This is also why hiring a Scrum Master should be an intentional and rigorous process. As outlined in [Hiring a Professional Scrum Master]({{< ref "/resources/blog/2021/2021-03-15-hiring-a-professional-scrum-master" >}}), organisations often make the mistake of prioritising certifications over experience, failing to assess whether a candidate truly embodies the role. A Scrum Master is not someone who simply “facilitates” but someone who **actively drives effectiveness, navigates complexity, and enables continuous delivery of value**.

## Conclusion: Scrum Masters Are Born Fully Formed

A Scrum Master is not a role that should be taken lightly. It is not a career ladder step, nor is it something one can simply “train” into without prior deep experience. The best Scrum Masters **emerge naturally** from within the team, already demonstrating the mastery required before they ever assume accountability formally.

The Scrum Master role demands mastery across technical, business, and organisational domains. Anything less is inadequate and frankly does not fulfil their obligation to the Scrum Team, the Product Owner, or the business.

If you are looking for a Scrum Master, don’t look at certifications or job titles. Look at the **people who have already been leading without the title**—those who have already demonstrated their competence in making the team more effective. That’s your Scrum Master.
