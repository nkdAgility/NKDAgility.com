One thing I loved, with the update of Media Player 11 and ActiveSync 4.2, on my phone ([Windows Mobile 5.0](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/default.mspx "Microsoft Windows Mobile") - [Orange](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly "Orange SPV M3100") [SPV M3100](http://www.coolsmartphone.com/index.php?option=articles&task=viewarticle&artid=680&Itemid=3 "SPV M3100 Review")) with Windows XP was that it detected that I had a 1gb SD card and added it to the sync devices of Media Player. This allowed me to download my Channel9 and DotNetRocks podcasts and sync them with my phone on a daily basis. I just could not be bothered to sync them manually before.

Then I updated to Vista! And the feature disappeared :(

I hope it is just because the "Mobile Device Center" is currently still in beta, but I get to sync with my main memory on my phone (50mb) but not my 1gb card.

Lets hope they fix this so I can listen to my podcasts again!
