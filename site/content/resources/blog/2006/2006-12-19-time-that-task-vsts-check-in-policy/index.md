I have found this interesting policy for TFS.

[http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320 "http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=9375fae2-5104-4d46-8b3a-c0b170b08320")

I can see a number of problems with it.

- What if a developer gets interrupted!
- What is they are working on a number of related tasks / bugs!

The solution to these problems is maybe an external system tray application that the checkin policy can communicate with that allows the developer to select what tasks that he/she is working on and update it accordingly!

This is something that I will need to look into!

Has anyone tried this tool in a production enviroment?
