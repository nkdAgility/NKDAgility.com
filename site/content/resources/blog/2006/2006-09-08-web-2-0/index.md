Over the last wee while I have been seeing a lot of talk of “Web 2.0” and I wondered what the hell it was! Was it .NET related? No. (Well kind of) So I set out on the onerous task of finding out. So I Googled it, and low and behold, the first result!

[http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html)

It seams that Web 2.0 or “The Internet 2.0” is more of an ethos than a single point.

I mention it as “Web 2.0” is becoming a buzz word for middle management, and so when asked if your project is “Web 2.0” you will be able to answer!
