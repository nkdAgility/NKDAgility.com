    <p class="lead">We have had a large number of customers over the years that
    desperately want to move from Quality Centre (now HP ALM) to… well… anything
    else to be honest. The current leader in the ALM space just happens to be my
    favourite tool, Team Foundation Server, and so I am continuously on the
    lookout for tools that can help us migrate from whatever the customer is
    using to Team Foundation Server.</p>

    Foundation Server as top ALM tool</strong></p>

    <p>There are currently three third party , one Microsoft and one HP tool in
    the migration and sync space for Quality Centre to Team Foundation Server
    and all of them have their drawbacks… there never is a perfect solution for
    migration or synchronisation, but there are a few tools in the
    Synchronisation space that are worth it and for Quality Centre there is one
    tool that can cut the Migration mustard.</p>

    <p>But first there are a number of questions that we need to ask
    ourselves:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Do we want to just Sync the content or Migrate it?</li>

    <li>Do we want history or TIP?</li>

    <li>Do we want unidirectional or bidirectional?</li>

    </ol>

    <p>And that is just part of the puzzle; So lets look at the players in this
    space…</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">TFS Integration Platform - <a
    title="http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/"
    href="http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/">http://tfsintegration.codeplex.com/</a></h3>

    <p>The TFS Integration Platform is an ALM Rangers project that is supported
    by a few guys on the product team and includes a bi-directional syncing
    engine that can handle both Migrations and Synchronisations between
    ultimately any platform and any other platform. It does this by allowing you
    to create an adapter for whatever system that you need and comes with a
    number of out-of-the-box adapters:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>TFS 2008</li>

    <li>TFS 2010</li>

    <li>TFS 2012</li>

    <li>SubVersion</li>

    <li>Rational ClearCase</li>

    <li>Rational ClearQuest</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Unfortunately this is a high maintenance system that is really only
    usable by experienced consultants for all but the most simple of tasks. In
    addition, <strong>to support HP Quality Centre would require the creation of
    a custom adapter</strong> that in my experience would take many weeks to
    perfect. If the TFS Integration Platform were more fully supported or there
    were more adapters available it could be a real contender in this space. As
    it is I have created a number of customer Adapters for it and it has a
    clunky API that is difficult to extent.</p>

    <p>This is not the solution for us in this case… but it should be!</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">OpsHub - <a title="http://www.opshub.com"
    href="http://www.opshub.com">http://www.opshub.com</a></h3>

    <p><em>(I was unable to get a “trial” version of this software and I am
    inherently cynical about any vendor that does not provide working
    software!)</em></p>

    <p>It currently looks like OpsHub is the top player with both
    Synchronisation and full history Migration but it is difficult to tell as
    they do not provide a downloadable trial. I don’t know about you, but unless
    I can run and verify a feature myself I take claim of capabilities with a
    pinch of salt. To date I have only seen evidence to claim synchronisation
    and not migration which is just fine. What is the difference you might ask,
    surely if you can do one you can do the other… well kind of.. more on that
    later…</p>

    <p>OpsHub Integrates with <a
    href="http://www.opshub.com/main/index.php/2012-08-31-18-28-21/partners"
    target="_blank">many companies products</a> and if they can do half of what
    they claim then it will be a very powerful tool…</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">TaskTop Sync - <a title="http://tasktop.com/sync"
    href="http://tasktop.com/sync">http://tasktop.com/sync</a></h3>

    <p><em>(I was unable to get a “trial” version of this software and I am
    inherently cynical about any vendor that does not provide working
    software!)</em></p>

    <p>TaskTop is the new kid on the block and now provides a solution called
    TaskTop Sync that allows us to Sync data on the server side between many
    systems. This is not migration and it will not take history, but it does
    allow you to access data from many ALM system from a single UI and to allow
    you to sync limited data between these systems.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"

    width="741" height="500" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Configuring
    TaskTop Sync</strong></p>

    <ul>

    <li>Team Foundation Server</li>

    <li>IBM Rational</li>

    <li>Borland StarTeam</li>

    <li>HP Quality Centre</li>

    <li>VersionOne</li>

    <li>ScrumWorks</li>

    <li><a href="http://tasktop.com/connectors" target="_blank">Many
    more…</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>If you have a very fragmented set of systems and you have no intention of
    consolidating them then a Sync tool is for you. I would always prefer to
    rationalise down to as few product sets as I can get away with but many
    organisation find this almost impossible within their existing culture. If
    you are in that situation then TaskTop provides many of those at the Work
    Item Tracking layer as it allows you to map only specified fields between
    the different products. That way you are only mapping what you need…</p>

    <p>I am however unsure how it supports Work Item Types as the only demos
    show mapping of Defects in HP to Tasks in TFS. This is not how I would map
    anything and I have not seen how configurable it is…</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">Scrat</h3>

    <p>Scrat is specifically designed to move data easily from Quality Centre to
    Team Foundation Server. I have worked with this tool before and I have a
    number of customers that have used it to successfully migrate all of their
    data to TFS. It has been a while since I used it, but I found it to be a
    very easy to follow process even accounting for all of the mappings that you
    are asked to provide.</p>

    <p><img alt=""
    src="http://www.selagroup.com/Content/Images/Products/Scrat/Scrat_04.jpg"
    /><br /><strong>Figure: Scrat configuration</strong></p>

    <p>This is the only tool that I can confirm that is capable of moving Test
    Steps as part of the migration.</p>

    <h3 class="icon-solution">HP ALM Synchronizer</h3>

    <p>HP themselves provide a synchronisation tool but there are many fields
    that they just can’t map. This tool was designed by HP to make sure that it
    was impossible to be used to “migrate” from HP to another system. This, if
    you think about it, makes perfect sense. It is however very free…</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image"

    width="479" height="356" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Mapping TFS and
    HP entities</strong></p>

    <p>The tool supports a number of other ALM tools:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>HP Application Lifecycle Management 11.00 and HP Quality Center
    10.00.</li>

    <li>Rational ClearQuest 2003.06.15; 2003.06.16; 7.0; 7.0.1; and 7.1.</li>

    <li>Rational RequisitePro 2003.06.15; 2003.06.16; 7.0; 7.0.1; and 7.1.</li>

    <li>Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2008 and 2010.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>It will allow for limited Syncing of content between the two systems. If
    this is all you need then it may be of use to you…</p>

    <h2 class="icon-conclusion">Conclusion for Quality Centre to Team Foundation
    Server</h2>

    <p>So there are three third party , one Microsoft and one HP tool that can
    move data in some fashion between Quality Centre and Team Foundation Server:
    TFS Integration Platform, OpsHub, TaskTop Sync, Scrat and HP ALM
    Synchronizer. Most of these are synchronisation tools but one stands out as
    a Migration tool.</p>

    <p>It is inherently not in the best interests of a Synchronisation tool to
    allow you to migrate data from one system to another. Once you do that, why
    would you need the synchronisation tool any more. The whole idea is to lock
    you into keeping both tools and thus extending your need for the
    synchronisation tool. In my honest opinion if you want to remove the need
    for the other tools, whatever that may be, you need to be looking at
    Migration tools and not synchronisation tools.</p>

    <p>Migration is the ability to move from one system to another without
    requiring to keep the old one around. You may need it anyway for audit or
    fuzzies, but it is not required for function. This would be a true migration
    where you bring all of the data, maybe the history, and pull it across into
    another system.</p>

    <p>Synchronisation is the ability to have two different items in two
    different systems linked in some way and have certain specified data points
    updated dynamically between them. With synchronisation we are not really
    concerned with unique data points to the individual systems as not only are
    we keeping them around but these uniqueness's are normally why we are doing
    so.</p>

    <p>So if you just want to synchronise I would recommend starting with
    “<strong>HP ALM Synchronizer</strong>” and verifying if the features meet
    you needs. If not then push out to “<strong>OpsHub”</strong> as it looks to
    have the better feature set and widest support for tools. If you are
    Migrating your Quality Centre implementation to TFS then the only choice is
    <strong>Scrat</strong>.</p>

      Martin,


      I'd like to add a few comments and clarifications regarding the Tasktop
      Sync solution reviewed in the post:


      * Tasktop Sync can synchronize any work item type in TFS with work items
      in external systems


      * While Tasktop Sync is deployed with a services engagement, the majority
      of this is process consulting to ensure teams of practitioners using
      customized tools will work effectively in the newly unified world where
      their systems are synchronized. Sync itself is a complete product rather
      than a framework and it isn't changed/modified/developed as part of a
      deployment engagement.


      * Tasktop Sync has a broad and sophisticated feature set suitable for
      enterprise scale synchronization scenarios. End users can use the Sync
      Studio GUI to update the configuration as well as monitor and manage using
      a dashboard. See feature details at http://help.tasktop.com 


      Feel free to contact me for more info or for a live demo of the software.

      If you have an installer &amp; some documentation I would be happy to poke
      around. A demo tells me what your software can do, not wither it will fill
      my need. I have a bunch of hypothetical needs in my head based around
      scenarios that I run into often. Every one however differs from every
      other engagement and I learn be doing...


      Can you provide a trial licence?

      Martin,  this is a great quick hit - thank you we are are going down the
      route of leveraging HP ALM with TFS 2010.

      The first thing you should do is upgrade to TFS 2013. Any tool built
      against 2010 will also work against 2013...

      note: if you use IE8 only go to 2012...

      Unfortunately we are tied to TFS 2010 with no option for migrating in the
      near future.  Any major pitfalls to be aware of and also do you know of
      any step by step demo's available I could peek at?

      thx Martin -  as we have gone through the exercise of looking at Task Top
      (Great product) and for now will be staying with HP Sync.  So, looking
      around for any demo's specific to HP/TFS syncing.

      Sorry, everyone I know that have tried to implement it has found HP Sync
      fairly unfit for purpose...it does not sync what you want as HP want you
      to be still locked into their product :( 


      Let me know if you have success...
