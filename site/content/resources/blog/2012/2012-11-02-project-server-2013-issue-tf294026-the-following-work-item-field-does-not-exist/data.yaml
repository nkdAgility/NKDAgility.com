      Was the project server sync for 2012 upgraded in any way to support
      iteration dates? or do you think Microsoft are expecting very few
      companies to bother with this sync now that the web access has all the new
      project management features?

      That is a very good questions and to be honest I am not sure. The
      documentation is not quite up to date with the SharePoint 2013 RTM and
      still talks of "Sprint" work item types...



      How would you like the Iteration date Synced? Do you want all work items
      within that Sprint/Iteration to reflect the same dates?

      Honestly i haven't thought too much about how it should work, i would
      suspect that having the items reflecting the same dates wouldn't be a
      popular choice. Probably depends a lot on which data source would win when
      there's a conflict. When Project Server &gt; TFS then updating the sprint
      to be the max/min datetimes of the related tasks would make sense, however
      if TFS &gt; Project Server then it would be more of a guideline/validation
      where tasks can't be scheduled outside of these dates.  *Shrug* I'm not
      actually sure syncing to project server would add much (if any) value and
      would probably just make things too complicated.

      Hi, today (06/17/2014) when  I try to do this kind of customization. We
      need more two fields to integration StartDate and FinishDate.


      on field section on workitem

           Start Date of Work - set once, when work begins. 
         
         
           Finish Date of Work - set once, when work ends. 
         

      on form section of workitem

      Hi - I've come across this issue when trying to add a Project Server to an
      existing TFS instance with Scrum projects that are already in progress.

      I've followed the instructions in the solution link regarding updating the
      Scrum task type definition (including the additions that Joao outlined
      above), but that doesn't help me upload the field mappings. I can't
      download the default mappings and modify them as you can't download
      mappings until they've been uploaded. Is there an example of a mappings
      file containing the default mappings (or even the default mappings
      modified to support scrum) anywhere that I can use as a basis?

      Thanks,

      Mark.

      Mark, if your teams are doing Scrum then using Project Server to manage
      the work will likely cripple their ability to deliver. It is not a good
      practice and I believe that the Scrum template deliberately does not
      support MS Project. As I have never tried to import Project Server on a
      Scrum team I have not hit this... the default mappings are listed on
      http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg412658.aspx#dmappings and you
      can build an xml file from the references.
