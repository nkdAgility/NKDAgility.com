    "reasoning": "The content primarily focuses on tools and techniques for bug fixing and regression testing in Agile environments, without explicitly discussing the concept of Agentic Agility. While it mentions Agile teams and the need for prioritisation in testing, it does not delve into the intentional shaping of outcomes or the principles of Agentic Agility. The discussion lacks depth and does not differentiate between human and AI capabilities in the context of agility.",
