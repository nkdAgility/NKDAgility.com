I will talk a little of the idea of the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2012/01/27/tfs-vnext-configuring-your-project-to-have-a-master-backlog-and-sub-teams.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Master or Hierarchical Backlogs</a> using the new Agile Planning tools and I always find an example help with understanding so I will be using a recent engagement as a base. But first lets dispel a few myths.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Team Project ≠ Team</li>\r\n \t<li>Team Project ≠ Project</li>\r\n \t<li>Team Project ≠ Product</li>\r\n \t<li>Team Project = WTF?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou might think that it has been unfortunately named, but the Visual Studio ALM tooling has been designed to have a low barrier to entry and as such the happy path is:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Team Project = Team</li>\r\n \t<li>Team Project = Project</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHave I confused you yet?\r\n\r\nWell, for the single, or small group of developers the common and easy path is to create a new Team Project for each project and they will only ever have one team. So this is the way that it is out-of-the-box and it serves its purpose.\r\n<h3>One Team Project to rule them all</h3>\r\nThe rest of us live in a more complicated world of multiple teams, multiple projects and multiple priorities. To achieve this we need to think about the following things in Team Foundation Server:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Teams (can be mapped to Area or to a Work Item Field Definition)</li>\r\n \t<li>Areas (Tree)</li>\r\n \t<li>Iteration (Tree)</li>\r\n \t<li>Source Code\_ (has folders)</li>\r\n \t<li>Work Item Queries (has folders)</li>\r\n \t<li>Build</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNo matter what our configuration and requirements we can use a single Team Project. There are however a number of circumstances where you will not be able to do this:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>A large consultancy</strong>If you are in a large consultancy with 1000+ customers then it makes more sense to use a\_ one Team Project per customer model so as to avoid confusion and scaling issues. Don’t think just because you are a consultancy that you need to use this model. Think carefully about your choice…</li>\r\n \t<li><strong>An organisation with 100’s of Teams</strong>If you are a single organisation that has 100’s of teams than you might also run into limitation of scale. I would in this case recommend that you have one Team Project per Department or Division depending on their scale and organisation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn these cases there are two limitation that need to be considered carefully. You can only have 254 areas per level and there is a soft limit of about 300 Team Projects per Team Project Collection.\r\n\r\nIf neither of these apply (or you are at the Customer, Department or Division level within an organisation within which it does) then you can achieve a single Team Project.\r\n<h3>One Team Project to find them</h3>\r\nSo, what has changed? Well with the advent of the idea and the technical implementation of Team in Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Service we can take advantage of the new constructs and reduce our complexity while simultaneously increase our features.\r\n\r\nI do however have a reality check for those of you that want to use the new tools but work within a traditionally run organisation.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image17.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"More than 34% of companies are now doing agile\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image17.png\" alt=\"More than 34% of companies are now doing agile\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Figure: More than 34% of companies are now doing agile</strong>\r\n\r\nThey are called the “Agile Planning” tools for a reason. They are exclusively targeted at the ~34% of the industry that are working in an Agile manor and that are 3 times more\_ likely to succeed than a traditionally run project. They are also aimed at the 30% that don’t really know what the want as an easy adoption path.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image18.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image18.png\" alt=\"Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Figure: Agile projects are 3 times more likely to be successful</strong>\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that those of you can’t use the Agile Planning tools? Hell no! It just means that you are not in the happy path so make the most of them that you can.\r\n<h3>One Team Project to bring them all</h3>\r\nIn a recent engagement my customer needed some rather specific things to be possible but also wanted to take advantage of the new Agile Planning features. They wanted to pull together all of the Teams and individuals from the Business all the way through the Development Teams to Infrastructure. To achieve that we identified a few must haves:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Must be able to see an ordered backlog per team</li>\r\n \t<li>Must be able to see an ordered backlog per department/customer</li>\r\n \t<li>Must be able to see what product and product area each work item is assigned to</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn order to achieve this all I need to customise is to add a single new field to the Product Backlog Item. Is we add a “[mycustomer].Customer” field to the PBI and make it a drop-down-list of all of the existing customers\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image19.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image19.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Figure: Adding a field to store the external customer</strong>\r\n\r\nI can then create a query for each of the customers to show the backlog and allow anyone with permission to view that backlog.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image20.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image20.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Figure: A Query showing an external customers backlog</strong>\r\n\r\nIf I can query it I can then export to excel and reorder it just like we did when connecting to TFS 2010.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image21.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"image\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/image21.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Figure: Reordering the backlog in Excel</strong>\r\n\r\nSo with a single added field we have enabled not only querying and ordering of data associated with a customer, but we also made the field reportable as a dimension in the data warehouse and cube.\r\n\r\nAwesome and easy…\r\n\r\nNow all we need to add is <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/greggboer/archive/2012/01/27/tfs-vnext-configuring-your-project-to-have-a-master-backlog-and-sub-teams.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two teams in the new Agile Planning tools in addition</a> to the default and configure them to only show their own backlog based on the Area Path (or we can configure it to use a Team drop-down).\r\n\r\nThe point is that we can support most, if not all configurations as long as you are willing to change the way that you work a little. Hopefully not much, but there is always change in adopting a new tool. Although we don’t want our tools to prescribe our workflow, we may actually want to change the way that we work to take advantage of cool things that we just had no access to before.\r\n<h3>And in the Process Template bind them</h3>\r\n<a href=\"http://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/220px-Gollum.png\"><img style=\"background-image: none; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"220px-Gollum\" src=\"https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/220px-Gollum.png\" alt=\"220px-Gollum\" width=\"84\" height=\"83\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /></a>The key to a successful Team Foundation Server deployment is in the Process Template that is chosen to be the base moving forward. I always start with the Visual Studio Scrum template as a base as it has the most compatible workflow and terminology to the way we tend to speak and discuss about work.\r\n\r\nRemember that whatever process template that you pick it is but a starting point for building your own process on top of. Don’t be afraid to customise, just don’t go nuts… no one likes a frankin-template…\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nNot only is larger Team Projects the recommendation of <a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/when-should-i-use-areas-in-tfs-instead-of-team-projects-in-team-foundation-server-2010/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">almost all of the experts in the field</a>, it is also the recommendation and expectation of the product team for mature teams and organisations using Team Foundation Server.\r\n\r\n<strong>How are Team Projects used at your organisation?</strong>"

      With the concept of Teams, does one actually have to modify the queries
      any longer?  As it seems in TFS 2012, each team has its own unique set of
      queries.  Just getting started with the concept of teams mapped to areas,
      but it seems this reduces the management of queries (that was listed in
      the 2010 post).  I may be missing a step, as I get the areas/iterations
      then assigning teams -&gt; areas (for the one master backlog)...at least I
      think I do =)  But wasn't sure about the queries. 

      Secondly, with the one master backlog, is it true to say that you wouldn't
      be managing the overall release from the root project, each project would
      be managed separately.  E.g. your not going to be assigning items from the
      master backlog to individual area sprints...that would be done through
      each 'team's area'.

      You are correct that you get queries, both "team" and "my" for each "Team"
      that you create within a Team Project. You also get Alerts per team. This
      is one of the biggest advantages of moving to TFS 2012 from the
      perspective of the management of work.


      To you second point... well it depends. You may indeed want a Master
      Backlog with some sort of hierarchy if you have many teams (10's) working
      on the same or related products. That way you could have a single vision
      for large rocks that are disseminated between teams...

      Thanks for the reply.  I'm just starting to get my feet wet with 2012 and
      like the team mapped to area approach.  Looks like it is a perfect fit for
      most organizations.  Manage the master backlog, assign it to team/areas,
      then each team can prioritize their own sub backlog and work the sprints
      accordingly. 

      One follow up question.  How do you handle a situation where one group
      might actually run sprints (during development), but others may just want
      to run a kanban board, basically no springs, just a prioritized backlog. 
      Would you just advice that second team (Kanban team) to only use the
      backlog board and not the task board?  Just curious to your thoughts on
      that.

      You are exactly correct...although I find that teams that do Scrum or
      Kanban also find value in a kanban or scrum boards respectively

      useful but not possible AFAIK with hosted TFS as you cannot change the
      template. Any suggestions for one big team working on many projects each
      with their own release schedules (devs can work on any project, sometimes
      on two projects at once) that works without changing the templates and
      works on hosted TFS?

      I don;t understand what does not work with hosted TFS? All of the above
      works with both TF Server (Self-hosted &amp; Hosted) as well as TF Service
      (Cloud) services... Nothing describes above requires you to change the
      template.


      You may be think of "Team Foundation Server 2012 Teams without Areas"
      which would require customisation, but you do not require to make that
      customisation to use many products and teams working in a single Team
      Project...



      Can you please specify what the issue is that you are encountering?

      If you use a single TFS 2012 Project to manage business projects which
      exist in separate Areas how can you give each business project a separate
      home page (see screenshot)? You can add different backlog items from each
      Area (business project) onto home page, but it doesn't look like you can
      create separate home pages. Scenario here is 2 teams of graduates working
      on 2 separate projects under same project manager - does this really
      require 2 TFS Projects or can you do it with one and give each team their
      own TFS 2012 Project home page?

      You need to create a "Team" for each group. That will give them their own

      As always, great article! I couldn't agree more. Yeah, you don't need new
      team project for a software project. It's easy to manage with one team
      project (in our case, product company) and have great visibility. We have
      customized template (added functional area, product type etc) to
      filter/categorize items. I would create new team project when there is a
      group/team with completely different process. So let's say company uses
      Waterfall process and newly acquired company uses Scrum.

      Thanks for the great article. I work in a large company with our own TFS
      servers, and we have a wide spectrum of implementations. In some cases 1
      TFS Project = 1 Product (and 1 team) and in other cases 1 TFS Project = 1
      Division with 10+ products and 10+ teams, some of them are programs of
      teams, and others 1-2 person teams. We've been having this debate for
      quite a while.


      One thing you haven't touched on is performance. We heavily use excel
      workbooks for project management, and the size of a project and collection
      have a HUGE impact. In some cases, the excel startup connection to TFS can
      take over a minute for a big project/collection, and in other cases it is
      as low as 10 seconds. We worked with Microsoft R&amp;D for about a year on
      this issue. TFS2012 is slightly better as it will auto-delete old build
      entries in lists, but in TFS2010 we had to have custom SQL run every month
      to do this cleaning.


      We had been heading towards keeping our collections small, perhaps 1 per
      division, and our projects small. Another idea is to keep 1 collection per
      division, then just 1-2 projects in that collection, and make them
      mega-projects as you've described.


      Has anyone else tried both approaches and measured performance impacts?

      If it is in the same collection then regardless wither it is in one or
      many projects you should have the same performance. In multiple
      collections your bottleneck may be the app tiers or your network capacity.


      As to scale. DivDev (Microsoft Developer Division) has a single team
      project that is over 17TB in the database so scale in a single team
      project is not an issue. Although I acknowledge the problem that you seam
      to be having and that you need to make sure you clean your databases
      effectively at scale.


      If you email me directly on "[firstname]@[surname].com" I will put you in
      touch with one of my colleagues that has just had to split a collection
      for performance reasons. He does however have 300+ divisions in TFS so it
      may not be for performance but for maintenance... lets figure that our.


      Each subsistent update for 2012 should improve the performance as the
      product team optimising for scale on Azure with

      Hi, 


      I may have misread your article but you say here:


      &gt;In order to achieve this all I need to customise is to add a single
      new 

      field to the Product Backlog Item. Is we add a “[mycustomer].Customer” 

      field to the PBI and make it a drop-down-list of all of the existing 

      customers.


      This is not possible with TFS Service

      Ahh.. I see the issue. The examples above were from a specific customer
      who did the "[mycustomer].Customer" field. That field is not required to
      create a single Team Project with many  Products existing within it.


      "Nothing describes above 'requires' you to change the template. There may
      however be things that you would like to do that you would be restricted
      from in the Cloud."


      I have many Team Projects on http://tfs.visualstudio.com that have many
      products without having to customize anything... What are you finding that
      you need?

      Great article. I really would like to use this strategy. But we face a
      problem now in Trials-


      We have multiple Teams and multiple work areas (distinguished based on
      product).


      We have one team as the 'project default' - this team comprises of all
      members involved and this team is assigned the root work area (including
      the sub-areas).


      We have individual teams assigned to their corresponding work areas.


      During the SPRINT planning the SCRUM master works on the root where the
      Team is the default team and all work areas are covered. He creates
      Backlog items, tasks and assigns it to specific area.


      He also fills in the capacity for all the members in the team for the
      current sprint.


      Problem is that this information on 'Capacity' of  a member is not
      reflected in the 'Team' space to which the member belongs. So the Burndown
      chart (specific to team) doesn't make sense unless we assign the capacity
      - specific to Team.


      I thought this strategy is useful for "One Master(One overview) - Multiple
      Teams" SCRUMs.

      Where from the root (project-of-projects) you can see the overall
      performance and from specific team you can see the team specific 
      performance.


      May be I misunderstood the basic Idea.


      Could you please help me?

      Capacity planning is done at the Team level and does not rollup. You could
      write a TFS event handler to rollup that data but I am not sure of the
      value.



      TFS 2013 solved this problem by removing Sprint planning from the parent
      Teams when not configured.So you don't see those features and think that
      they work at that level...

      Very nice article Martin. 


      I have a bit of different scenario, and I will at the outset say that this
      may not be so common.

      We have a fairly small team that works across various products. We manage
      our product classifications in areas and sub areas. We have various
      releases through out the year, one which is on a regular monthly cadence
      for product enhancement type work and a few other scattered throughout the
      year which are more like projects that could span several months. our team
      setup is volatile and is setup based on releases. So each release has a
      release team assigned to it depending on availability and requirements for
      the release.

      I know I can't use iteration path as a way of setting up teams (like area
      paths), cause I tried and its not supported and of course iterations will
      keep adding on as time progresses and may not be the right thing to use.
      So the method to use a new field called team and updating common
      configuration seems to be the logical way to go. But my question is, is
      there a way I can possibly have this new field populate automatically with
      the leaf node of the iteration the work item is set to. I tried doing this
      and was not able to get it to work, cause of conflicting types. Any
      suggestions?


      Note: I have also had the pleasure of working with Martin in person on an
      onsite visit to our company.

      Hi Im not sure I understand the concept of project hierarchy in TFS very
      well. In my company we have a finite amount of products for internal use,
      a few common database and components, all which are modified through
      fixes/production support. We follow a waterfall dev process, not sprints
      like scrum. We have less than 50 developers. Could you give me some advice
      on what would be an optimum way to organize tfs? like Product1 with
      feature 1-2-3-n, fix1-2-3-n ? I don't understand the concept of team in
      tfs either...

      I would ultimately recommend hat you get a TFS Consultant in to help you
      out here as the answer would be very specific to your organisation.

      Hi Martin,



      I have a few follow up questions if you don't mind:



      1) I see that each team can customize the columns in its own
      Kanban/Backlog Board.  Is the data behind these boards and the associated
      CFDs accessible for reporting?  It doesn't look like that data is stored
      within the Work Item itself.



      2) We're interested in being able to produce CFDs both at the Team level
      and at the Team Project level.  We'd like to be able to report on a number
      of metrics around this data, including cycle time between any two points
      on the board.  At what point would it make sense to customize the Work
      Item Workflow States to match our Kanban board columns and to introduce
      custom date fields on the Work Item to track the transition dates?



      Thanks!

      1) Currently the Kanban columns are not pushed through to reporting. If
      however you look at the history of the Work Item you will see a [Kanban
      Column]Team A = [Column] in there. The data is in the operational store
      and the Product Team have just not decided how to surface that  data.


      I know that this is currently a pain and it is a major ask from most of my
      customers too. However if you do delve into the world of Columns per
      Backlog per team you will quickly encounter the issue... remember in 2013
      you have multiple backlogs on the same team...


      2) If your base Kanban columns are consinstant across all of your teams
      then you will likely need to make that customisation to get the reporting.
      However you will have to accept the burden of updating all of the OOB RS
      &amp; Excel reports to reflect that change. Indeed it will make your
      upgrades a little more complicated as well.


      First I would check out @tfsjeff's TFS Kanban Tabular Model
      http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/388df6bd-10fe-4366-8712-58643e334995?SRC=Home
      as a first rate solution that may require less work to implement.

      Nice article, but when you add a desire to use git as your version control
      system in TFS 2013 this all falls apart. A single teamproject for an
      organization means a single git repo for the organization. Managing things
      at the subfolder/subproject level get hard now. I know your answer, "don't
      use git." But git provides benefits and if we'd made the decision to go
      with git what is the guidance?

      It does not. In fact it is much easier with Git. You can have many Git
      Repositories per Team Project and I have asked to be able to mix and match
      TFVC and Git repos within the same Team Project. 

      I would recommend that you create a Git Repo per product that you are
      delivering within that single Team Project.

      If you look at the dates it was requested less than a month before it was
      implemented. I have a feeling that it was being implemented anyway and was
      just turned on :) now if only we can get mix and match :)

      Thanks Martin for the article on one big project. It looks like my
      department is going to go that way. My question is this can I control my
      workflow based on Area. Meaning from the Proposed State If I changed my
      Area can I have Assigned to be changed based on that Area or Team. I have
      been testing with 2 groups set up in my Project level security and I am
      trying to get the Rules around 'Assigned to' to changed based on the Area
      that I change to. I have tried the two separate When Rules and 2 separate
      values ffor Area ID and have tried the same for WhenChanged Rule and did
      AllowedValues for the 2 different Security groups. Any ideas would be
      appreciated.

      Larry, for no good reason there are limitations on what rules can be
      applied to the Area Path field. Gregg Boer has a good post on work around:

      Thanks Martin. That article helped a little.  I am using TFS 2012. My
      question centers more around contolling the Allowed Values for the
      Assigned To field. I am trying to dynamically have the 'Assigned To' field
      populate with a certain group based on what the AreaID is. Our Area are
      set at the same name as our team names and should stay at the top level.
      With each team there is a certain group of people that I want 'Assigned
      to' to populate with. Do you think this is possible?

      That sounds like you should be able to use a WHEN clause on the AssignedTo
      field that sets the list based on Area Path.

      I've worked for both GE Healthcare and Caradigm (formerly Microsoft's
      HSG).  We used this model at both companies to tremendous success.  The
      Team Projects were divided among organizational boundaries (e.g. Dev had a
      Team Project, Ops another).  I'm working hard to implement this at my
      current company, I believe this will be a great success story for the
      organization.

      Holy smokes, thanks for this blog! I've been trying to implement TFS, and
      now that my proselytizing has gotten me somewhere, this is a great jump
      off point - It's answered "the" question on how to set up TFS. Just a
      quick question - The CMMI template seems to have more of the workflow we
      are looking for as an organization -  Especially the "Change Request"
      portion. How often do you find other orgs using  this template?

      @julie_steiner:disqus you should take a look at
      http://nkdagility.com/agile-vs-scrum-process-templates-team-foundation-server/
      . Every company I have ever seen moves more towards the Scrum template,
      even if they take the Change Request ( although that in itself can be
      mitigated difernetly) and add it to the template. Did you know that the
      first ever Scrum project in 2001 was CMMI level 5 and for life critical
      systems. You can do CMMI and have the functionality of change requests
      without actually having a separate work item type.

      @disqus_2ig9eqTl3h:disqus , while I understand that you got value from
      this I do not recommend this way of working. Creating silos within your
      organisation (and separate Team Projects does do this) based on skill is a
      recipe for disaster. Instead of having functional teams from your
      organisations perspective many teams find it far more valuable and
      effective to have functional teams from the Deliverables perspective. Each
      team having all the required personnel to ship a code a code change from
      top-to-bottom in there application and Dev-&gt;Prod.


      Microsoft has been doing it ineffectively for many years and is only now
      (that's one big ship to turn) moving towards a much more agile process.
      The only way to ship to production every three weeks as DevDiv does or at
      least every quarter as Xbox does (they actually have many smaller releases
      internally) and twice yearly as the Windows team now does is to break down
      those barriers and start creating cross functional teams...

      Hi, my company are currently looking at moving to the single team project
      approach described in your article, I wondered if anyone that has
      previously made the switch had any feedback on performance impacts? are
      there any case studies around performance? thanks Steve

      Hi Martin, thanks for the reply.

      Have you encountered any issues with having multiple code bases combined
      in one TPC? we have many applications that we would ultimately look to
      intergrade into this approach, would this hamper build performance, or web
      view TFS response times?

      I can not access the blog that you posted a link to, I get a group does
      not exsist message on screen.

      Cheers

      Steve

      No one has touched on security.  We have over 2000 developers and 500
      applications.  Some of the apps are grouped and deploy together but some
      are individual. There's typically one set of developers that work on an
      app or group of apps.  With one TP, we would have roughly 250 folders for
      each app or group of apps.  How do we make it so that the teams that work
      on certain apps don't have access to other folders in the tree?  For
      instance, if we have a folder called "Product S" that contains subfolders
      that represent all the apps that make up "Product S" and then another
      folder called "Product R", how do I assign folder permissions to restrict
      access?  Access control is a huge deal in my company.

      @disqus_JpKdbvPbHt:disqus its an interesting discussion. Now while you can
      do security at that level it does get a little messy. I would recommend
      that you look for those hard boundaries, where people are not working on,
      or switching between, different codebases. This is where you would have a
      hard boundary and to be hones I would do another Collection with a single
      Team Project. This will give you some ability to backup and restore more
      granularly and to scale more effectively. If PersonA works on Project S
      for a few years and then may move to Project R and will no longer work on
      Project S then this works great. If its a bug mess in there with everyone
      working on everything you really need to sort out that mess first.

      For almost all of my customers I have been recommending moving forward
      with Git Repositories in TFS. You create a single Team Project for work
      item tracking and have a distinct Git Repository per product. You can then
      permission the Repositories based on Teams.

      You made this statement above "Now all we need to add is two teams in the
      new Agile Planning tools in addition to the default and configure them to
      only show their own backlog based on the Area Path (or we can configure it
      to use a Team drop-down".    Can you elaborate on how to implement the
      Team drop-down solution?
       I have one TFS project where they are using scrum 2.0 template.  There are 3 Agile teams which work on all areas of the product.  They have meaningless names like Red, Green, Blue because they are not dedicated to any particular area.  Initially they set their area paths to Red, Green, Blue so they could assign work to those teams and have isolated Team backlogs.  However Support and QA want to define real product Areas and we would like to report on those areas (e.g. report to show which area of the product has the most bugs).  The problem is we have no way to then delegate work to each team if I can't slice it along the Area Path.  I could add a Team drop-down field but then how do I make it so that only items assigned to this team show in their backlog and use regular drag-drop prioritization?  While I could create queries based on a team field, we don't want to work in a query where we cannot prioritize.  Thus I need a way for what shows up in the backlog to be contingent upon the Team field rather than area.

      you have two options to resolve this: 


      1) you can create a Product1 node and then add a Product1Green and a
      Product1Red as well as a Product2Green. Then the Green team 'owns' both of
      the Green nodes.


      this is the recommended way


      2) You can look at Team Field. With this you can create a new drop down
      for 'team' and use that instead of area as your tem designation.

      Thank you so much for the link to "Team Field"!!  I think this will solve
      our issue.  The project actually contains just one large product with many
      functional areas so not sure the first solution can be used since an Area
      Path might look like "Framework/Admin/Red".    Red,Green, Blue would be
      duplicated everywhere for each functional area. I did think about doing
      the inverse however where I just duplicated the entire Area set of nodes
      under top-level nodes Red,Green,Blue but this also seemed sub-optimal.

      Hi! Does a single team project still make sense with TFS2015, or has new
      functionality made it unnecessary? We are currently on TFS 2013 with
      multiple projects and it is clear that one project with multiple areas
      will solve a lot of our issues in terms of visibility and reporting. But
      we are also planning on upgrading to TFS2015, so I was curious if it still
      makes sense to consolidate to one project.

      No there is not. If you are in VSTS you might get some use out of the
      Planning hub, which does go across Team Projects, but everything else is
      bound to the Team Project.


      If you want to email me for options we can discuss further and in more
      detail.

      Martin, could you clarify the following statement regarding Areas in TFS:


      "You can only have 254 areas per level"


      I'm using online Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) rather than on-premise
      TFS. As a new administrator of VSTS, I have very limited experience so I
      want to confirm my understanding before proceeding with the implementation
      of VSTS for my company.


      To illustrate my concern, I'll provide a brief example. Assume that a
      company is a consultancy that works on many development projects for many
      clients. Using the "One Team Project to Rule Them All" design, the
      consultancy might use the following structure for Area to separate access
      between clients while maintaining streamlined workflow and reporting for
      their projects:


      RootTeamProject/Client001/Project001

      RootTeamProject/Client001/Project002

      RootTeamProject/Client002/Project001

      RootTeamProject/Client002/Project002


      Based on my understanding of your statement, it would appear that this
      design will fail if the consultancy has more than 254 clients or if it has
      a client with more than 254 projects. If my understanding is accurate,
      could you suggest how to work around this limitation in the scenario
      described above?


      From my research, I know that large companies use the "One Team Project to
      Rule Them All" design successfully, so I'm wondering what I might be
      missing?


      Thanks.

      Correct. You should add a DropDown with the customer entries in the list
      rather than an Area Path.
