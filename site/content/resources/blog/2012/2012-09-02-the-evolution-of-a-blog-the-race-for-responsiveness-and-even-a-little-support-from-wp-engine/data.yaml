    Thanks to the folks who emails to let me now of problems, some I was already
    on top of… others needed a good poking. The downtime was due to me moving my
    hosting provider. This blog has had a few homes over the years (my
    goodness…6 years!) and as it has grown so it has slowed. My site is image
    heavy and I also make poor choice of plugins in favour of features. It has
    been a constant annoyance for me that my blog has had abysmal loading times
    of late.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

    sucks</strong></p>

    <p>I think you can see my issue… and often I have been hit by shared server
    syndrome with the only response from support being “someone must be running
    a process on the server” and “it will probably end soon” with a little bit
    of “well we cant kill someone else's process!” and I think that was the
    final straw. If I am on a shared environment I expect my provider to protect
    me from the other Muppets kicking the box as well as myself.</p>

    <p>So my blog has gone through many iteration:</p>

    <ol>

    <li><strong>Move from GeeksWithBlogs to Wordpress on DiscountASP.NET ($3 per
    month)</strong><br />This was a features issue as I was happy with the speed
    from GWB  </li>

    <li><strong>Moved from DiscountASP.NET to GoDaddy ($5 per month)</strong><br
    />Unless you want to spring $100 per months for a dedicated server
    DiscountASP.NET is not good for hosting a production site. It was sllowwww… 
    </li>

    <li><strong>Moved from GoDaddy to <a
    href="http://wpengine.com/?SSAID=687520" target="_blank">WPEngine</a> ($29
    per month)<br /></strong>GoDaddy have a little better support but still with
    the slow. </li>

    </ol>

    <p>And now I have moved to WPEngine. Although they offer a service to move
    you blog for you for $200, but I am hard-core and wanted to feel the pain
    myself <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style:
    none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none;
    border-right-style: none" alt="Smile"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/wlEmoticon-smile.png"/></p>

    <p>But nicely enough the provide some <a
    href="http://support.wpengine.com/migration-process/?SSAID=687520"
    target="_blank">awesome instructions</a> that gave me an almost seamless
    migration. Luckily I have had to debug crappy plugins doing weird stuff
    before and I have my own crazy DNS setup that I have had for a few
    years…</p>

    site</strong></p>

    <p>While there are many awesome plugins you can often have a little trouble
    with installing, activating and deleting in the right order across a
    Multi-Site implementation of Wordpress, but there is now hope!</p>

    <p>The nice folks over at WP Engine have a list of <a
    href="http://support.wpengine.com/disallowed-plugins/?SSAID=687520"
    target="_blank">disallowed plugins</a> that they absolutely will delete from
    the site of anyone that implements them. These are plugins that they have
    identified as just plain sucking form a performance standpoint and I salute
    them for laying down those terms… we users need protection from the evils
    that we do not fully understand and this helps a little. So what do I get at
    WP Engine that I did not get elsewhere?</p>

    <ol>

    <li><strong>Dedicated support for word press and most plugins</strong>

    <p>In the 3-4 hours it took to get all my ducks in a row for moving my site
    I had 5 support tickets knocked off. Each and every one was answered within
    15 minutes and dealt with within 60. Not bad <img class="wlEmoticon
    wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none;
    border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/wlEmoticon-smile.png"/></p>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Snapshots</strong>

    <p>Going to change some settings? Try something out? Create a Snapshot at
    the click of a button and have it restored at another click… Awesome.</p>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Staging Area</strong>

    <p>Going to do something even more dangerous that you are not sure will
    work? Click the Staging button and WP Engine will create a duplicate of your
    site for you to practice with. You get one staging area and can over write
    it any time you like.</p>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Speed…</strong>

    <p>This is the biggest one for you. Promises for you to have a faster
    site.</p>

    </li>

    </ol>

    <p>After looking at the list of “disavowed” plugins I decided to kill the
    ones that I was using on GoDaddy and I got a %50 increases or more on my
    site just with that. So the following comparison is plugin neutral. Check
    out the screenie from Google Analytics above for the “before” the great
    plugin cull of August 2012.</p>

    <p>My homepage lists the short form of the posts and has a couple of
    controls that help folks navigate and has been reduced from 8s to 2s..
    that's 4 times faster.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image2.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

    (GoDaddy)</strong></p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image3.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

    height="213"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Homepage After (WP
    Engine)</strong></p>

    <p>As the aggressive caching kicks in these numbers will only improve, but
    my Events page, which makes use of a lot of data has gone from 10s to 5
    seconds… 2 times faster.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image4.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;
    background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image_thumb4.png" width="614"
    height="217"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Events page Before</strong></p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image5.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;
    background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:

    height="222"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Events Page After</strong></p>

    <p>And I picked a significantly large post with lots of images to get 6s
    before and ~2s after… that's nearly a 3 times improvement.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image6.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;

    padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px;
    border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image_thumb6.png" width="619"
    height="220"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Big post before</strong></p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/09/image7.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px;
    background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px;
    border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image"

    height="221"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Big Post After</strong></p>

    <p>But its not the number that matter. My blog now feels responsive and I
    don’t roll my eyes every time I want to view another page. This is what I am
    happy with…and all of the pain of moving was worth the result..so far <img

    border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style:
