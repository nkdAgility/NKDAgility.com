    <p>I recently ran into an odd problem at a customer where the local computer
    accounts of a computer joined to a domain started showing the SID
    periodically. For those not in the know, this is BAD.  </p><p><font
    color="#ff0000">WARNING: I did not find a solution to my problem, but this
    should server as a documentation of what I tried, what did not work, and
    possible resolutions that were unachievable in the time frame. In fact, all
    of this could be nothing to do with the problem at all… just
    saying...</font>  <h3>The Problem</h3> </p><p>I first notices that even when
    I added "Domain Users" to a security group in TFS my "Assigned To" list was
    empty of all users except those specifically added. It looks like when I
    name a user my local credentials are used and it is successful, but when I
    add a group it fails.  </p><p><a

    The Subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested
    the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a
    local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.


    The Logon Type field indicates the kind of logon that was requested. The
    most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).


    The Process Information fields indicate which account and process on the
    system requested the logon.


    The Network Information fields indicate where a remote logon request
    originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank
    in some cases.


    The authentication information fields provide detailed information about
    this specific logon request.
        - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
        - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
        - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested.

    </p><p><strong>Figure: This implies that the Machine account does not have
    permission to AD</strong> 

    </p><p>Now, when you join a computer to a domain it actually gets an account
    on the domain and a password just like a user. The account is always the
    computer name appended with a $ which looks like "tfs01$". The password for
    that account is set every 30 days by request of the client, and there can
    rarely be any problems.

    </p><p>But in this case it looks for&nbsp; it looks as if the machine
    account has become out of sync, so lets try <a
    href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216393">resetting the computer
    account</a>. <pre class="brush: plain;">C:Userstfs_service&gt;netdom reset
    "tfs01" /domain:companydomain

    The secure channel from TFS01 to the domain COMPANYDOMAIN has 

    been reset.  The connection is with the 

    machine DC01.COMPANYDOMAIN.COM.


    The command completed successfully.

    </pre>

    </p><p><strong>Figure: Using netdom to reset the secure channel</strong>

    </p><p>This should update AD with a new password set by the client, so lets
    test it out: <pre class="brush: plain;">C:Userstfs_service&gt;Nltest
    /SC_Verify:companydomain  /SERVER:tfs01

    Flags: b0 HAS_IP  HAS_TIMESERV

    Trusted DC Name dc01.companydomain.com

    Trusted DC Connection Status Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success

    Trust Verification Status = 0 0x0 NERR_Success


    The command completed successfully</pre>

    </p><p><strong>Figure: Using nltest to check the secure channel</strong>

    </p><p>After resetting the account I rebooted the server and checked again
    for the error messages, and dam but they were still there. My next approach
    was to reset the computer account in Active Directory Users and Computers.
    After you do this you will need to re-join the computer to the domain as you
    will get an error on login that states "<a
    href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfssetup/thread/d261abe1-3008-4e8a-bf8a-ef249ee7d341">The
    trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain
    failed</a>” for which it it worth investigating. In this case however it is
    a problem of our own making with the reset, and can be fixed by following: 

    <ol>

    <li>Join computer to any workgroup 

    </li><li>Reboot 

    </li><li>Login as local Administrator account 

    </li><li>Join computer to domain 

    </li><li>Reboot 

    </li><li>Login as domain account</li></ol>

    </p><p>Even this is not you done. When you do a remove, re-join certain
    services do not like it and you will have to do the following: 

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Fix Reporting Services</strong> - Re-add the "key" to reporting
    services through the configuration console as it got confused

    </li><li><strong>Fix SharePoint</strong> - Re-run the SharePoint
    Configuration without changing anything as it thinks that the machine name
    has changed</li></ul>

    </p><p>While this should solve most problems with authentication, it did not
    solve this one. You may also see a <a
    href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810977">Event ID 5722 is logged on
    your domain controller</a> which should also be fixed, but is a result of
    the things that I have tried so far. 

    </p><p>So where next? 

    </p><p>Well, one thing to make sure of is that the <a
    href="http://billwg.blogspot.com/2008/12/tfs-service-account-requires-read.html">TFS
    2010 service account has permission to read from the domain</a>, but it
    unusual to have this problem as this is the default for accounts in AD. If
    you have a more locked down configuration it may be something you need to
    look at. 

    </p><p>One of my colleagues (Rennie) thought that if the Active Directory
    Domain Services have not been maintained properly (this is a very small
    company with no real AD skills in-house) then they may have lost one or more
    of their domain roles. Specifically the PDC Emulation role.&nbsp;
    </p><p>&nbsp;<a

    height="440"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: It looks like the PDC Emulation role
    is OK </strong>

    </p><p>This was definitely worth a check, and while it was OK, I did notice
    something that confused and then shocked me. You now those moments when you
    find out something that just does not compute, and you just stare at it! 

    <blockquote>

    <p>This is a Windows 2000 Domain Controller! </p></blockquote>

    </p><p>Now that I know that a whole host more potential issues rear their
    ugly heads.&nbsp; </p><p>So, now to check that Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
    is installed but who knows which hotfix level if any, and what about bugs
    that were only fixed in later versions of the OS!&nbsp; </p><p>Pha! (throws
    up hands in disgust)&nbsp; Is Windows 2000 domains even supported in TFS? 

    <blockquote>

    <p>Team Foundation Server is supported in the following Active Directory
    modes and functional levels:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Windows 2000 Active Directory in native mode.</li>

    <li>Windows Server 2003 Active Directory in Windows 2000 native mode.</li>

    <li>Windows Server 2003 Active Directory in Windows Server 2003 functional

    </p><p>What do you know, it is supported (somewhat) 

    </p><p>Windows 2000 domains are only supported in Native mode and will not
    work in mixed mode (does anyone still have Windows NT4 in prodution?) so
    lets take a look.

    </p><p><strong>Figure: Will I am a monkeys uncle, it is!</strong> 

    </p><p>While this may be true, I still hold some reservation for the notion
    that a Domain upgrade may be necessary! To be honest, if it is a miss
    configuration of the domain somewhere in the mists of time, then a domain
    replacement may be a better option and creating a brand new "Windows 2008 R2
    Domain" would have at least he benefit of modern defaults. 

    </p><p>While on the Domain Controller I also noticed Event ID 1789 in the
    event log that got me looking into another article on <a
    href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=976494">Error 1789 when you use the
    LookupAccountName function on a computer that is running Windows Server 2008
    R2</a> that while technically is included in the last service pack was not
    working of me. I could not even apply the Hotfix as it game me the "this
    update is not valid for your computer" message that is no help. There are
    manual steps for <a
    href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsserver2008r2general/thread/846afed4-f3cc-47df-abd0-d111b7d3476a">Local
    Groups not resolving domain group name</a> which stopped that error from
    being listed, which is one more step closer to a stable working system.

    </p><p>After all of those steps and spelunking I only have one error message
    left. The one that started it all… the TF200035… and I can’t seam to get it
    to talk to Active Directory.

    </p><p>One thing you may want to try is using TfsSecurity.exe to check
    wither the accounts are in sync. This can be done easily and there are two
    things I want to check. First the TFS_Service account:<pre class="brush:

    for some sort of help here! Everything looks just fine except for not being
    able ot query AD. This is looking more and more like a… “someone ticked a
    box 7 years ago in AD and no one remembers where or why problem”.

    </p><p>For those that have encountered them before, there are almost
    impossible to debug. This is why small companies tend to use the
    out-of-the-box config and bug companies buy auditing software.

    </p><p>The very last thing that I can check is that the accounts that have
    been added to TFS are in deed syncing, even if the groups are not:

    </p><p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image1.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px;
    border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/02/image_thumb1.png" width="640"
    height="708"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: making sure the identities in TFS
    are up to date</strong>

    </p><p>Well, that was my last option and I have no further insights. I am
    sure that I will need to return to this in the future, but for now I have
    implemented a workaround for the customer. they can use the system, but
    without AD groups.

    </p><p>While this sucks…sometimes an internal network configuration beats
    you…. Humph….

    <h3>The Work Around</h3>

    </p><p>As I have no real solution for this problem that I chased around I
    have to come up with a workaround that will provide the customer with at
    least the ability to use TFS. So I created the following local groups at the
    Server level: 

    <ul>

    <li>Company Developers 

    </li><li>Company Management 

    </li><li>Company Project Managers 

    </li><li>Company Project Admins</li></ul>

    </p><p>I added them with permission onto the individual team projects and
    added user accounts directly into these TFS Groups. This lets us secure some
    work item types, states and have users listed in the drop downs. 

    </p><p>Symptom treated.... 

    </p><p>Solving the problem looks to be something that the customer is
    unwilling ot pay me to do, but I left them with some advice: 

    <ul>

    <li>Try an upgrade to Windows Sever 2008 R2 domain controllers 

    </li><li>If the problem still exists then create a new Windows Server 2008
    R2 domain and move everyone accross</li></ul>

    </p><p>In saying that this may not even be the problem!
