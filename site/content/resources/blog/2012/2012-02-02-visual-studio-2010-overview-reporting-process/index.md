The Process Template governs nearly all aspects of how the team interacts with Visual Studio and TFS (e.g., the structure and flow of work items). Whether a team has a well-established development process or needs to define one, proper template selection and practice are critical.

Reports and dashboards (targeted to the selected team process) provide essential transparency and empower teams to identify and address opportunities for continuous process improvement.
