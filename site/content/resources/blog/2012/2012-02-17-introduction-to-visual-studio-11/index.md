[![image](images/image_thumb1.png)](http://blog.nwcadence.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image1.png)Over on the Northwest Cadence blog we are doing a big push on Visual Studio 11 (dev11) content.  I and my colleagues will be delivering content on Visual Studio 11,  Visual Studio 11 Team Foundation Server & Visual Studio Team Foundation Service (AKA TFS Preview).

I have been concentrating on the hosted (azure) version of TFS and my first blog post has just gone up on [http://blog.nwcadence.com](http://blog.nwcadence.com) that includes both screenshots, opinions and video demos of TFS preview in action.

Some of the highlights are:

- Live ID login
- Web UI that works on more than IE
- Dates on Iterations
- Built in support for Team’s
- Project & Team profiles with images and identity
- Default areas and Iterations for teams
- Support for configuring Alerts for others and teams
- The ability to see effective permissions
- Options to see where those effective permissions came from

I only have one post today, but I have more tomorrow:

And this just the beginning…
