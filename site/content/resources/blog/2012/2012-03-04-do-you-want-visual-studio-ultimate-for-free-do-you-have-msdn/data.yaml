    <p class="lead">Are you a professional developer? Do you get an MSDN from
    your organisation? Did you know that you can use it at home on both
    commercial and open source projects of your own!</p>

    <blockquote><p>MSDN subscriptions are licensed on a <strong>per-user
    basis</strong>.&nbsp; One person can use the software to design, develop,
    test, or demonstrate his or her programs on <strong>any number of
    devices</strong>.&nbsp; Each person who uses the software this way needs a
    license.<br />-<a

    </blockquote>

    <p>That's right, the MSDN that you company bought you entitles you to run
    Windows, Office &amp; Visual Studio in production at home. Its a licence for
    YOU and not just for them.</p>

    width="640" height="274"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Over 11 terabytes of
    data on MSDN</strong></p>

    <p>I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/mgroves84"
    target="_blank">Mark Groves</a> at the MVP Summit and I had a double-take
    when he mentioned that most developers don’t know that you get a take-home
    licence with you MSDN. I was surprise because I have know and taken
    advantage of this for the better part of 8 years, and I was even more
    surprised when he mentioned that <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/"
    target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> was also unaware of this. This is an
    awesome benefit to being a Microsoft developer and I can’t believe that it
    is not more well known.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image13.png"><img
    title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image:

    width="640" height="461"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: You get Azure time as
    well</strong></p>

    <p>On top of that you get a number of other benefits. You get the Azure time
    above and you also get the ability to run an almost limitless number of
    development boxes as well. Basically for a developer with MSDN you can
    almost run “whatever” at home and be fully licenced and I have never
    encountered anyone who has maxed out their instances.</p>

    <p>The thing that I tend to find that is not done is the assignment of MSDN
    licences that a company has bough to the individuals that are using it. What
    companies really don’t understand is that no matter how many MSDN licences
    that they own, they are not licenced to use any of it unless they are
    assigned to individual Live ID’s.</p>

    <blockquote><p>MSDN subscriptions are <strong>only offered per
    individual</strong>, there are no “team” subscriptions or sharing of
    subscription benefits.<br />-<a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx"
    target="_blank">MSDN Licencing</a></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>In most companies that I do work for the operations team hoards the
    MSDN’s so those pesky developers can’t download on the network. But this, my
    dear ops guys means that you are using software illegally within your
    company, so get over it and assign those&nbsp; MSDN subscription to those
    that they were bought for!</p>

    <p>Did you EVER have an MSDN? Another of those little known things about an
    MSDN is that it is perpetual. That is that you can use forever the software
    that became available when you received your MSDN.</p>

    <blockquote><p>In most cases, MSDN subscriptions come with
    <strong>“perpetual” use rights</strong>—the ability to continue using the
    software after the subscription has expired, even though the ability to
    download software and product keys ends when the subscription expires.<br
    />-<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx"
    target="_blank">MSDN Licencing</a></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>You just don’t get anything new <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile"
    style="border-top-style: none; border-bottom-style: none;
    border-right-style: none; border-left-style: none" alt="Smile"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/wlEmoticon-smile.png"/></p>

    <p>And just in case you were worries about buying licences for your business
    acceptance testing (BAT) then:</p>

    <blockquote><p>When software development projects are nearing completion, an
    MSDN subscription license also <strong>allows your end users to access the
    software to perform acceptance tests</strong> on your programs.<br />-<a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/cc150618.aspx"
    target="_blank">MSDN Licencing</a></p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>MSDN has one of the most flexible licencing terms in the industry and you
    should be using it to its full potential and not leaving it on a shelf! It
    will make some of your developers more valuable if they can exercise the
    tools in their spare time and the others just will not take advantage of
    it.</p>

      Great info! How about running a software factory kind of thing? We have 4
      test servers per team (front, back, app &amp; sql) and about 3 teams. How
      does this conform to MSDN?

      Thanks Martin, 

      Actually I knew about this before but what I didn't know about it, that
      Scott Hanselman didn't know :-) and this expected, Microsoft is a big
      company and not everyone knows everything :-)

      What in case of :


      I am a person who 


      - Owns license to Visual Studio 2010 and e.g. MSDN Licence for Windows 7
      Ultimate


      - I am a tester in an external company (outsourced tester) where I use my
      Licence of Visual Studio for editing test scripts.


      - External company provides me a dedicated workstation to which I connect
      remotely.


      Can I install and use there my MSDN Windows 7 Ultimate to run e.g.
      Selenium Tests on a virtual machine (In this example I'm not developing
      software directly for that external company, only running own tests on
      their software - only me)  ?

    comment_content: "\"MSDN has one of the most flexible licencing terms in the industry\"...\nWell, that depends. If you have MSDN subscriptions as part of a Silver or Gold partnership\_the following\_restrictions apply: \n\"You cannot use MSDN subscriptions offered through the Microsoft Partner Network \nfor direct revenue-generating activities, such as providing consulting services, \ncustomizing a packaged application for a specific customer, or building a custom \napplication for a customer, for a fee.\", \nhttps://partner.microsoft.com/40029254\nSo, beware that what you inform people about here\_only\_applies to\_certain\_MSDN subscriptions, not all.

      Good tip for those who don't already know. I've always done this when i've
      worked at companies that provide their Developers with an MSDN license.



      The fact that the licenses are perpetual is something people often forget.


      I blogged recently about my prediction/hope that we may see the
      introduction of a subscription model specifically for Visual Studio when
      2013 is released. ( http://bit.ly/148d2Li )


      MSDN is great when the company is paying for it, for individuals who don't
      have this luxury, or very small dev teams/businesses I think a cheaper,
      monthly subscription just for the various Visual Studio versions would be
      great.


      Without all the Azure benefits, office, various operating systems etc

      That first sentence that you quoted seems to imply that it is only valid
      for development purposes up to testing and user acceptance.  i.e. it
      DOESN'T seem to include production or commercial use (in fact, I beleive
      that elsewhere in the license agreement it actually says that the software
      is not to be used for production purposes) - so is it really the case that
      this is allowed?

      You can't use MSDN licences in Production. However if you have a Visual
      Studio with MSDN you get 5 production Windows and Office licences for YOUR
      use only. So you can run Visual Studio on all of your computers for
      building software. As soon as you are deploying your software to
      production you would require to pay for licences...

      OK, so in that case, although still good I suppose, it's not as attractive
      as your initial opening statement implied: "Did you know that you can use
      it at home on both commercial and open source projects of your own!".

      So you can "work" on commercial software at home, but can't deploy,
      distribute, or sell your work until you have bought another "retail"
      license.

      That's disappointing, and may very well be a significant reason not to go
      the MSDN route if either your company needs to produce software for
      production use, or you want to do this yourself to make some money
      freelancing etc.

      Of course you have to pay for your production deployments! Why would you
      not? If you have a hosted server then the OS will be included in the
      price. If you self-host then you need to pay for Windows or whatever OS
      you use. MSDN is about development. You do not need to pay for any of your
      Development or Test environments and it also include a production
      environment for you to use to write the software. 


      This is FAR cheaper than paying for all of your environments. So why is it
      disappointing?

      MSDN is for developers to build software not for running software in
      production. If you licence all of your developers for MSDN you only need
      to pay for: your production servers. If you do not have MSDN you have to
      pay for: you developers workstations, your development servers and your QA
      servers. You are not allowed to run the software provided by MSDN in
      production, but you can build an application using it and that can ship to
      production servers that you licence for production use. Did that make more
      sense?

      What happens if you leave the company and company transfers the membership
      to another developer: "If a license is transferred or sold, then
      everything installed using that license must be uninstalled" from 


      http://www.itassetmanagement.net/2011/05/31/msdn-subscriptions-pt-1/


      is that the right assumption ? we should un-install when we leave the
      company?

      My understanding is that as the MSDN licences (except Partner ones) are
      perpetual you do not need to un-install when you leave the company. You
      retain all of the licences that you already had at the time your MSDN is
      re-assigned and if you keep the keys and ISO's handy you can use them
      forever. You just do not get future updates... however the article you
      reference tells a different story... I am not sure which is correct...

      Hello,

      Interesting post. What about the use of MSDN licences for test lab or
      pre-prod labs, but when the VMs are hosted by a hosting provider ?

      Will there be a difference if the VMs are managed by us (the customer) or
      by the hosting provider ?

      Thanks,

      Hi again,


      Actually, I have found information about that situation and I thought I
      would share: it is possible since 1st June 2013, through MSDN Cloud use
      Rights, if your hosting provider is "Qualified MSDN cloud partner".


      &lt;&gt;

      Hi Martin,


      I saw what you wrote on the perpetual licence and opened the EULA again
      since I remember this is incorrect. According to the EULA most  MSDN
      subscriber do not have the right to continue and use the license after the
      subscription expire. Can you please direct me to where I can find that
      this is a perpetual and I can use it after my subscription expire?

      Thanks 

      Elad

      Almost all MSDN subscribers get a perpetual licence. The only
      non-perpetual licences are those granted to Partners or through promotions
      like BisSpark. If you or your company pay for an MSDN then it is likley
      perpetual.

      Hi,


      Thanks for the reply. this is the section from the MSDN EULA I refer to;


      Generally, MSDN subscriptions that do not provide perpetual use

      rights include:


      MSDN subscriptions

      purchased through Enterprise Agreement Subscription, Open Value
      Subscription,

      Campus Agreement, or other “subscription” Volume Licensing programs


      MSDN subscriptions offered

      through the Microsoft Partner Network including the Microsoft Action Pack

      Development and Design subscription.


      I'm talking about Visual Studio with MSDN not Visual Studio. What you are
      writing is a great news for me but I need to verify it and get something
      official.

      Thanks

      Really? Because I do a lot of free lancing and open source projects. I get
      paid for these projects. Can I use my company's msdn subscription of
      visual studio 2013 ultimate on my home pc(visual studio pro 2012)??

      No, when the MSDN is assigned to someone else by your company you no
      longer have access. If Yu bought it, or you still worked for the company
      and they or you let it lapse then it is perpetual.

      OK, I'm 8 years late on this blog.  My bad.  However, let me point out
      that Microsoft's legal team has been the most unreasonable group ever. 
      But it sounds like they've changed their tune, thank God.  And here's why
      I say this:


      I was an MSDN professional subscriber for several years back in the
      1990's.  I paid for that out my own pocket by the way.  I spent hours
      reading the legal documentation, I know for fact that for *years*
      Microsoft made a really big deal about using MSDN software for personal
      use and that it was *not acceptable*.  I could go on and on about this. 
      Here's just one example:  for *years* although Office was included in
      MSDN, the Microsoft legal docs were excruciatingly harsh on Office's use,
      saying that the Developer (human being) was only allowed to use Office so
      as to either *develop* with it or *test* with it, such as writing VB
      Script code in MS Word.  But it could *positively not be used* for
      personal reasons, such as having your own copy of Word for your private
      use on your computer.  This was also the case for *everything* included in
      MSDN -- *everything* mind you.  In fact for this exact reason, I finally
      decided to stop renewing my MSDN license.  The greed of Microsoft's legal
      department was truly over the top.  And this went on for at least a decade
      that I know of.  So yes, it's shocking to hear that they are now allowing
      developers to actually use their software.  I'm still suspicious of it.
