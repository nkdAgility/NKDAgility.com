    <p>I was actually a little surprised by one of my customers this week. I was
    there to help them finalise their deployment of TFS 2010 (that they were
    currently using only for Source Control) and to present the features to them
    and ended up upgrading them to TFS 2012 as well!</p>

    <p>The first thing that they wanted was a management level presentation of
    the capabilities of TFS and how everything goes together. I have both a 2010
    and a 2012 soup-to-nuts presentation so I though I would hybridise. With the
    Visual Studio 2012 Release Candidate being so recently launched and
    combining that with the knowledge that Windows 8 needs to be in stores for
    Christmas and the full production “Go-Live” licencing provided by Microsoft
    it is a no-brainer to use Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server now
    rather than wait for RTM. In fact, if you are currently just using TFS for
    source control, or are in the process of deploying TFS 2010 now, I would
    wholeheartedly recommend jumping in with 2012. If you are using more
    features you will need to do a little more planning, but you should still
    consider it…</p>

    <p>This particular company is a major utility company and I had little hope
    of convincing them to move directly to 2012, but as I am so convicted that
    TFS 2012 is the way forward, it would be remiss of me if I did not try. I
    presented on Monday, and I upgraded them to TFS 2012 on Wednesday. Amazingly
    they immediately wanted to upgrade… no planning… just do it! Not my usual
    method…. but…</p>

    <p>From the products perspective this was a very strait-forward upgrade.
    From their environment, which I had no knowledge of to start with, it was a
    little more complicated. They were running SQL Server 2008 and would have
    needed to upgrade to 2008 R2 as a minimum, but the DB was on a central all
    in one cluster so that was going to be a big deal.</p>

    <p>So the we moved the DB’s to a new SQL 2012 on the TFS Server. With a very
    long lead time for upgrades (they just moved to 2008) and a longer lead time
    for servers, this was the most realistic way forward.</p>

    <p>We did run into a problem on our first go around on Tuesday that the
    server was not service packed and we had to wait for their server management
    company to apply it. Other than that there was only the normal issues that
    you get with a TFS environment that has been locked down after the last
    deployment… you know… no SysAdmin on SQL, locked down Analysis Services,
    remote SharePoint owned by another team… </p>

    <h3>So what does it take to convince your organisation to move to Visual
    Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server?</h3>

    <p>So I had a full half day to present to their senior management so I
    talked about:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>

    <p><strong>Vision – what are you buying into with Visual Studio
    ALM</strong></p>

    <p>We looked at what TFS gives you out-of-the-box as well as some of the
    more recent additions. They had a minimum of Premium for all of their
    engineers so they already had a foundation of features to start with.</p>

    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: Visual Studio ALM</strong></p>

    <p>Even just his list of things can be a little overwhelming, so I stayed
    away from the three new Russian doll models and concentrated on the breadth
    of capabilities from a high level. At this point I assess my audience and
    decide wither I need to bang the Agile drum…</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p><strong>Agile – we can do better</strong></p>

    <p>Although the war had been won and it is now accepted as fact that Agile
    is a better way to build software than more traditional approaches there are
    still some hold outs. I talk about how “Agile” is now so widely used that it
    is now just “agile” and like “Waterfall” before it has become so diverse as
    to be more difficult than ever to pin down.</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image12.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: More folks are doing agile than ever
    before</strong></p>

    <p>I am sure that in another 50 years we will still hear stories of the loan
    company sticking its head out of the sand and saying “What do you mean the
    war is over?”</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image13.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: The CHAOS Manifesto</strong></p>

    <p>You are just more likely to succeed with agile… so lets accept things and
    move forward on that premise.</p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <p><strong>Tractability in Team Foundation Server</strong></p>

    <p>This is key to most companies and is true of both 2010 and 2012. The crux
    of the argument is that everything in Visual Studio ALM is interconnected
    and that gives us the ability to trace from every line of code written
    through the Tasks to the PBI (Requirement, User Story, Bug) that elicited
    tat change.</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:
    0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image14.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: Visual Studio 2010
    Tractability</strong></p>

    <p>Better than that we can then relate our requirements to builds, and the
    icing on the cake is full test case tractability back to the builds.
    Awesome…</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:
    0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image15.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: Visual Studio 2012
    Tractability</strong></p>

    <p>Then we can hit the 2012 features and add tractability for Customer
    Feedback to PBI’s and for full integrated code reviews of every
    check-in.</p>

    <p>This one premise in the main killer feature for any company that has
    auditors…</p>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Process Improvement</strong>

    <p>At this point I really need to introduce the reality that TFS is just a
    Tool…and a tool does not solve your problems. It may help, but it can only
    improve your process as part of a concerted effort to…well… improve you
    processes.</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:
    0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image16.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: TFS can be use to improve you
    process</strong> </p>

    </li>

    <li><strong>Continuous Value Delivery</strong>

    <p>I then finish up with lots of demos on the various areas TFS and Visual
    Studio depending on the audience. In this case it was mostly managers and
    execs so I stayed in Storyboarding, Work Item Tracking and Feedback.</p>

    <p><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width:
    0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px;
    padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width:
    0px" border="0" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/06/image17.png" width="640"
    height="360"/><br /><strong>Figure: Delivering Value is the key</strong></p>

    </li>

    </ol>

    <p>So if you are presenting TFS to your management there is a lot for them
    to like. So much so, that if done right you should have no trouble
    convicting them that TFS will provide them with value. You do however need
    to remember that if your processes suck then TFS will not magically make
    them all better unless you also change your processes.</p>

    <p>Good luck with your convincing…</p>

      Ahhh... I do :) A bug is just a PBI. It goes on the backlog and is
      prioritized like everything else.
