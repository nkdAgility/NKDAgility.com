Its that time again where the Visual Studio and team Foundation Server teams are pushing out their next version of their tools, Visual Studio 11. [Steven & Lori Borg](http://nwcadence.com) teamed up to present a video on [why you would want to Go-Live with Visual Studio 11](http://blog.nwcadence.com/go-live-with-visual-studio-11-beta-3/). I used the Go-Live with many companies with the Visual Studio 2010 launch with no problems. Its as safe as a “RTM” product from most other teams.

**Figure: Why would you go live**

Not only should you Go-Live, but it is safe to do so as it is fully supported by Microsoft for production use. That said, you will probably still need some help and Northwest Cadence can help.
