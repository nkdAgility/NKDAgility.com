    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses upgrading Team Foundation Server (TFS) from version 2008 to 2010, focusing on technical aspects of the upgrade process and configuration. There are no direct mentions of Scrum roles, events, or principles, and the discussion does not align with the core themes of Scrum, such as team dynamics or continuous improvement. The content lacks depth in relation to Scrum, making it largely irrelevant to the category.",
