  - "<p>After my post on the new <a href=\"http://www.tafiti.com/\">Tafiti</a>\_search engine a fellow by the name of <a href=\"http://www.searchcrystal.com/\">Anselm</a>\_pointed out <a title=\"http://www.searchcrystal.com\" href=\"http://www.searchcrystal.com\" target=\"_blank\">Search Crystal</a>, another visual search engine that produces some good result. I did not get he same Wow that I did from Tafiti, but the amount of information that is provided through the interface is extensive.</p> <p>You can change the display of the results from Cluster (the default) to Spiral and list. I did find that the List option is very confusing and difficult to navigate, and the Spiral option seams of limited use to me personally. It was a good idea to use the cluster view as the default and I think they have put the most work into this part of the system.</p> <p>All in all, it is very good, but I think that from a visual perspective the Tafiti interface works better, al be it with only one search engine.</p> <p>Below you can see an example of the search results, and you should be able to play with it. This does indeed work on Virtual Workstations, while the tree view from Tafiti has some problems due to the slow refresh.</p> <p> </p> <p>Have you seen any other search visualization website's? Let me know...</p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia\" rel=\"tag\">Dyslexia</a>\_</div>"

      Martin, thank you discussing searchCrystal and embedding a crystal.<br
      />searchCrystal shows you the quality of the results and guides you toward
      relevant results: <br />a) the more engines that find a result and the
      more highly they rank it, the better the result;<br />b) the greater the
      agreement between the search engines, the better the quality of
      results.<br /><br />In your search "Martin Hinshelwood" there several
      results found by three engines and your blog is very close to the center,
      which means that it is highly ranked by Google, Yahoo and MSN. <br />From
      a SEO point of view, your blog should be found by all five engines ... why
      is not? You are using different domain names "geekswithblogs.net"; and
      "geekswithblogs.com";<br />This is just to illustrate that searchCrystal
      can be used as a "mirror"; to see how the major search engines rank one's
      site for different search topics.<br />The free full version lets you
      compare 50-500 results in a single display, you can filter and annotate
      results and use it as a powerful research and competitive tool.<br /><br
      />You write: "I did find that the List option is very confusing and
      difficult to navigate, and the Spiral option seams of limited use to me
      personally";<br />Could you tell me more about what specifically is
      confusing and difficult to navigate in the list display? <br />Looking
      forward to hearing from you and thanking you in advance for your feedback.

      The reason I feel that it is dificult to navigate is, to be honest,
      probably down to what I am using it for. Not as a research tool, but as a
      search replacement. I find the cluster view very effective for searching
      as you can see imediatly what results are usefull.<br /><br />I find the
      spiral view confusing. I am not sure why, but my eyes go a bit wonky when
      I am viewing it. This, I think is down to the dyslexia as my brain is
      trying to view it from every angle.<br /><br />The list view, I just find
      clutered. I knwo that the cluster view you would think is the most
      clutered, but my brain sorts it out fairly quickly, where as the list view
      takes me a while to get used to the layout, where the information is and
      what it is telling me.<br /><br />I find that on the cluster view it is
      easy to filter the bits of information that you do not need imediatly out
      of the view...<br /><br />My advice would be to simplify the list view,
      maybe have more info on a roll over. But, hey, you are trying to go for
      the research market, and maybe they think diferently...

      Martin, thank you for the detailed feedback.<br />Agree with you, the List
      view can be simplified and streamlined: we have the colored icons and then
      the stacked bar chart that communicate similar info ... the icons are
      there to maintain consistency across the different views.<br
      />searchCrystal is an experimental service and needs to be further
      refined: your feedback helps us figure what is essential and what needs to
      be changed and simplified.<br />The RankSpiral can be useful to see all
      the results without the icons overlapping. If you move the cursor over the
      angled titles then you get more details and this way you can scan very
      rapidly through the list.<br />It is also worth mentioning, there is a
      free full version where multiple crystals can be displayed and explored in
      a larger screen area.<br />Thanks again for your helpful feedback.
