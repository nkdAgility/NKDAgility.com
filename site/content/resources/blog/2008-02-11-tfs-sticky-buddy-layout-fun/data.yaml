    href="http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy" target="_blank">TFS Sticky
    Buddy</a> project using Windows Forms, and eventually decided that it was
    way to fiddle doing it in a Forms based application. It was not just that
    tables and panels don't work as I expected, but that there were way to many
    bits that were more difficult than they should be. This is mostly down to my
    inexperience and down right ineptitude with graphics and UI's, but it still
    should not be this hard. <img

    I know that the picture on the right is not pretty, and the colours I have
    picked are pretty random to help solve the layout issues, but the
    application works....


    The problems, as you can see from the image are layout ones. I tried the
    FlowLayoutPanel, but I could for the life of me, not get the bloody boxes to
    stretch to fit the contents. Then I used the TableLayoutPanel, and ran into
    what you see above...Yeuch <img
    src="http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_sniff.gif" alt="smile_sniff"
    /> (Scottish for Yuck (Like Loch)).


    I guess I spent too much time doing web development when I was younger, but
    now when I try to go back to web based stuff I always end up shouting and
    swearing at the html layouts and growling at the post-back functionality...


    What I needed was something that was a cross between Windows Forms, and Web
    Forms. Something that had good layout functionality, but without the messing
    around necessary with HTML and CSS. You see, I like HTML and CSS, except for
    one little thing... It never does what you tell it. At least forms do what
    you tell them, and that is sometimes the problem with forms, they do ONLY
    what you tell them.<img

    />


    I had only spent a day on the application so far, so I was not overly
    concerned about the loss of time. I had chosen Windows Forms because I knew
    it, but deep down I knew that Windows Presentation Foundation was the way to
    go, I was just scared of the steep clime of understanding...<img

    <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-TFSStickyBuddylayoutfun_782F-image_4.png"><img
    style="border-width: 0px;"

    border="0" alt="TFS Sticky Buddy (WPF) Screenshot" width="244" height="144"
    align="right" /></a> Sod it...Of I went with a WPF version... And the result
    were impressive. Not only have I only spent a day and a half on it, but the
    immediate learning curve is a lot smaller than I though. Sure, you can add
    styles and templates among other things, but to get what you get with
    Windows Forms (only prettier) takes less time, not more, even with the
    learning curve (but I guess that is dependant on how quick you are <img
    src="http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_wink.gif" alt="smile_wink"
    />). And I am sure that once I master the other functionality provided in
    WPF it will become much easer.


    Sure, if you look at the image for the second WPF version you will still see
    layout problems, but they are minor and fixable (although I am not sure how
    yet), and the whole thing was a more painless to tweak.


    I will try to release these two versions along with the source code today,
    but just as a POC (Proof of Concept) to show the potential of the
    application.


    I want to have nice little callouts of information when you move your mouse
    over a work item or Area/Iteration, and I am continuing to work on it....
