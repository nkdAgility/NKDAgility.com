    <p class="lead">I have been working with a company in Silicon Valley that is
    doing one of the most complex Team Foundation Server migrations that I think
    I have ever seen. Just to pile on the complexity they also threw a
    SharePoint consolidation at me so I caught that as well.</p>

    <p>As with the previous TFS Edition we are moving SharePoint data through
    multiple environments and in the case of SharePoint we are only worried
    about consolidation. There are many SharePoint sites used by this
    organisation that are strung around the corporate network and we first need
    to consolidate them onto a single server so that we can easily migrate them
    to SharePoint 2013.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;

    width="390" height="302" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Production
    SharePoint Environment</small></p>

    <p>Initially we are doing a single server trial consolidation and upgrade to
    prove out the process and make sure that everything works. Here we will find
    all of the issues and tribulations that will inhibit our ability to make
    this transition easy. Lets get started…</p>

    <h2>Setting up the environment</h2>

    <p>We have a bunch of things that need to be installed and I have previously
    documented each one. As these installations are consistent with how I always
    install these products and the only variants are referenced.</p>

    <ol>

    <li><a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/installing-tfs-2012-on-server-2012-with-sql-2012/"
    target="_blank">Install SQL Server 2012 SP1</a> (Step #2 only &amp; use
    default accounts)</li>

    <li><a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/install-sharepoint-2013-on-windows-server-2012-without-a-domain/"
    target="_blank">Installing SharePoint Server 2013</a> (but use a Domain
    Account and do not create a Site Collection)</li>

    <li><a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/integrating-project-server-2013-with-team-foundation-server-2012/"
    target="_blank">Installing Project Server 2013</a> (Step #3
    only)<!--EndFragment--></li>

    </ol>

    <p>If you are able to create a snapshot at each stage then it may save you
    time if you forget to add a feature or if something fails. Once you have
    these three steps complete then you should remove all of the old Snapshots
    and create a new clean one for the server.</p>

    <h2>For each Content database you are consolidating</h2>

    <p>There are only a few simple steps to importing and upgrading your
    SharePoint 2010 content databases to SharePoint 2013. Note that there are
    additional steps listed below that you can run each time or all at the
    end.</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Copy backup locally</li>

    <li>Restore the SharePoint 2010 Content Database</li>

    <li>Create a Web Application to host the Content Collection (the first one
    will already exist)</li>

    <li>Call SP PowerShell: “Mount-SPContentDatabase -Name iptvsigportal
    -DatabaseServer reno-sp -WebApplication <a
    href="http://reno-sp">http://reno-sp</a>”</li>

    <li>Upgrade the site collection to 2013: “Site Settings | Site Collection
    Administration | Site Collection Upgrade”</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Note: You may need to run a few fixes for pages that have been customised
    with SharePoint Designer (<a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/sharepoint-2013-issue-custom-web-part-results-in-could-not-load-file-or-assembly-after-upgrade/"
    target="_blank">SharePoint 2013 Issue – Custom Web Part results in Could not
    load file or assembly after upgrade</a>.)</p>

    <h2>Post Mount Activities</h2>

    <p>Because we are both moving from multiple server and consolidating with an
    upgrade to a new version of the product we have a couple of
    post-consolidation steps to make sure that everything is accessible and
    above board.</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Add Firewall rules for other ports</li>

    <li>Rename Web Applications</li>

    <li><a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/sharepoint-2013-issue-after-migration-from-2010-user-permission-not-working/?preview=true"
    target="_blank">Migrate users to Claim Based Authentication</a></li>

    <li>Moving environment (domain) {Optional}</li>

    </ol>

    <p>These activities are required for good operation and support of
    SharePoint 2013 with upgraded</p>

    <h3>Add Firewall rules for other ports</h3>

    <p>This one took me by surprise and I had not realised that SharePoint 2013
    does not add the firewall rules to allow access when you create a new site
    on a new port. In this case we have 80, 81 and 82. Only 80 has been granted
    access by default and we need to add the other two.</p>

    <p>You can take the slow approach and add rules through the UI but recently
    I have been preferring to use the scriptable approach so in PowerShell you
    do:</p>

    <pre>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SharePoint80" dir=in
    action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80

    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SharePoint81" dir=in action=allow
    protocol=TCP localport=81

    netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="SharePoint82" dir=in action=allow
    protocol=TCP localport=82</pre>

    <p><!--EndFragment--></p>

    <p>This will allow ports 80 through 82 incoming requests.</p>

    <h3>Rename Web Applications</h3>

    <p>This is a simple piece of PowerShell to do the rename. You can’t do it
    through the UI except when you do the initial creation and it is easier to
    determine which site is which if the name reflects the content.</p>

    <pre>$wa=Get-SPWebApplication | where {$_.Name -match "SharePoint - 80"}

    $wa.Name="SiteAwesome"

    $wa.Update()

    </pre>

    <p>Simples.</p>

    <h3>Moving environment (domain) {Optional}</h3>

    <p>When we do a domain migration from DomainA to DomainBdomains we will have
    an additional step of telling SharePoint what the mapping is between the
    users in DomainA to DomainB.</p>

    <p>To do this we need to create a “usermapping.csv” that has “OldUsername”
    and “NewUsername” columns with a row for each of the users and the
    mapping.</p>

    <pre>Param(
         [string] $csvusers = "C:spconsolusermapping.csv"
        )
    Add-PSSnapIn Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell


    foreach ($wa in get-SPWebApplication)

    {
       $UserList=IMPORT-CSV $csvusers
       Foreach ($Person in $UserList) {
            Move-SPUser –Identity "DomainA$Person.OldUsername" –NewAlias "DomainA$Person.NewUsername"
       }
    }

    </pre>

    <p>This PowerShell will map each of the users across to the new domain and
    allow them to access the SharePoint sites with the name accounts as well as
    maintaining traceability.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Upgrading SharePoint 2012 to SharePoint 2013 is not quite as easy as it
    is with Team Foundation Server. There are quite a few pitfalls and it took
    some amount of research to get the above all working.</p>

      Hey MH!


      :)



      In the conclusion "Upgrading SharePoint 2012 to SharePoint 2013".  I think
      you probably mean 2010 to 2013?  




      If the upgrade was just content database, you might have got off easy. 
      The hard stuff is customizations that people might have done to their 2010
      sites.  



      You also mentioned a link to Project Server 2013 at the beginning, I'm not
      sure if you ended up installing that as well.

      Did you also look at installing Search Application or Office Web Apps as
      well?  2013 installation can get very crazy, all too quickly.
