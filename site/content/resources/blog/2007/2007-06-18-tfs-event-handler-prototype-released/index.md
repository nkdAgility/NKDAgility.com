As promised I have [released](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=5057 "TFS Event Handler (Prototype)") the application and code for my prototype [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler). I am currently working on the documentation, but I though I would give the bravest of you advanced notice of the release. You should be able to figure out how to configure it and extend it without much help (who reads documentation anyway), but for those of you who need that extra hand I will hopefully, time permitting, be releasing some sort of rudimentary documentation today!
