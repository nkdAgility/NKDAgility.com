I got a call from a friend of mine (Neil Ramsay) who was installing TFS for his company ([http://www.quantad.com](http://www.quantad.com)). Needless to say, he had a few problems, as everyone does when installing TFS. So he gave me a call and I road to the resque.

The big advantage of installing TFS in a amall comapany, is that you can OWN the entire server. He gave me teh admin password and I had TFS eating out of my hand in about 20 minutes.

Neil had managed to get TFS working in an imresive mear 2 days, and that is not being sarcastic. It took me 5 days in an enterprise enviroment...

There were a couple of permission issues, but that got sorted in quick order.

Neil then broke the bad news to me...One of his developers had moved to Spain and still need access! Sh1t...

Tune in next week to see how I got on with external SSL!
