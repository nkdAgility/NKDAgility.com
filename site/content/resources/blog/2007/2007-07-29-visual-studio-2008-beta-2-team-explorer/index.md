Well, I now have Visual Studio 2008 Team Suit [installed](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/29/Installing-the-.NET-Framework-3.5-Beta-2-on-Vista.aspx "Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 Beta 2 on Vista") on my laptop, but I have just realized that Team Explorer is not provided as part of the installation (same as VS2005). This is irritating as now I need to download Visual Studio 2008 team Foundation Server to get the client out of it.

I think that Team Explorer should be included as an optional install for Visual Studio, this would help at work as well as we need to rationalize and package (a 2 month process) every piece of software. If Team Explorer was available as part of the installation of VS2008 then I could avoid extra hassle.

I will get back to you once I have VSTE installed...
