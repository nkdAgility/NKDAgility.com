Well, that's me in my last month at [Merrill Lynch](http://www.ml.com/) after a nice run as a developer. My reasons for moving I have [stated](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx) before, but I have decided that the contractor business is just too risky for me at the moment.

So I have accepted an offer from [Aggreko](http://www.aggreko.co.uk/)! They have managed to woo me with their culture of embracing new technology that even the highest echelons of the company promotes with their insatiable appetite for new things.

I think that this will be a pivotal move for me that will allow me to expand my expertise in the areas that I am interested in (Sharepoint, [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server"), .NET 3.x, and others) as well as work with many like minded technofiles.

I will let you know how I get on, but for now I have a months notice to work and many handover documents to write!
