I got an interesting question from our SQL Server DBA team in London today. They asked if you can integrate team server with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I had a look at the software and could not see TFS source control in the list, so I did a little google and found:

[Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server MSSCCI Provider](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=87E1FFBD-A484-4C3A-8776-D560AB1E6198&displaylang=en "MSSCCI Provider")

Which allows you to connect the following software to team servfer:

- Visual Studio .NET 2003
- Visual C++ 6 SP6
- Visual Visual Basic 6 SP6
- Visual FoxPro 9 SP1
- Microsoft Access 2003 SP2
- **SQL Server Management Studio**
- Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect 6.1
- Sybase PowerBuilder 10.5
- Toad for SQL Server 2.0
  Ahh, they think of everything!
