I have just been made aware of a [new ('ish) service.](http://www.netidme.net/ "netidme") It allows you to verify the identity of those users you interact with online. This is a very usefully service for any online site or community where users are under 18, but is there any value for those of us that are not?

Would more people interact with me if they could verify my identity? I am not sure.

The service support a number of interfaces that includes [NetIDme Cardspace](http://netidme-cardspace.com/blog/?p=3 "NetIDme Cardspace") and [NetIDme ChatShield](http://www.netidme.net/chatshield.htm "NetIDme ChatShield") (for MSN Messenger), although they do not say if they support Windows Live Messenger I would assume they do if they are looking ant new technologies like CardSpace.

In the future could a combination of [CardSpace](http://cardspace.netfx3.com/) and an [Internet identity verification](https://www.netidme.com/netidme.aspx) replace active directory in an ever online world.

In that envisioned world, all online / hosted services could come together with local services to provide a seamlessly integrated and interactive world where I can log into [SharePoint](http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx), [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx), [Google](http://www.google.co.uk), [Live](http://get.live.com/betas/home), [Exchange Server](http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx), [Active Directory](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/activedirectory/default.mspx) and windows using a single login with full security and authentication! This sort of service could tie all Single-Sign-On services together with a single **Identity**.

Hmm, the future is bright...

You
