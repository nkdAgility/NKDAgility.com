I had spotted these updates last night in a [post](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/2007/08/07/windows-vista-pre-sp1-performance-and-reliability-updates-released.aspx "Windows Vista Pre-SP1 Performance and Reliability Updates Released") by [Robert McLaws](http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/) and decided, what the heck, I'll give it a go...

I had no trouble installing the updates, but they do take a while and require a reboot, but when Vista started again I could see that it was running faster than the normal fresh boot.

Now, I am running vista on my Laptop, which is old, not very old, but old none the less. It is of the Dell flavor and has only 1GB (upgraded) of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card. It can be Sloooow.

Now, thanks to the updates, its faster, leaner and meaner! All the better to run Visual Studio 2008 with...

Robert: Are you "barely old enough to legally buy alcohol" by US or UK standards? If its US, then you could have been drinking legally here for 3+years and illegally for 5+ years depending on your 5 o'clock shadow :)
