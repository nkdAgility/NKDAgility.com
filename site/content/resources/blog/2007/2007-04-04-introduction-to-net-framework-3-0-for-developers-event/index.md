Yesterday I visited the Strathclyde University campus to see a half day session from Microsoft's [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx).

It was very informative, and although I have been developing in .NET 3.0 for around three months there were some areas that I was sketchy on. Specifically "CardSpace" and its use and benefits. A number of other delegates also had concerns which I also shared. Mike managed to answer them effectively for me, I am not sure about the others, and I can see the use of CardSpace as a single sign on solution that does not require a username or password.

Mike seams to have a thing for Windows Workflow Foundation as he got carried away with that part of the session and had to skip most of [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation"). I totally agree with him that WF is an excellent piece of work and fills a niche that prior to WF us developers needed to either code ourselves or pay exorbitant costs for a third party product.

Although I had heard about 60% of the session before, it was well worth while as there were many bits that helped the rest fall into place...

I was especially interested in a class property manager thingy that is used in workflow. I did not get a chance to enquire of Mike if this can be used by developers independently of WF, but I can see many of the advantages of using it.

Mike, if you are listening, and can decipher my cryptic description, can you answer this?
