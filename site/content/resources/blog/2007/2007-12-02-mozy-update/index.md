Well, due to my campaign to get lots of free bandwidth I now have an additional 2.3 GB on top of my initial free 2GB bringing the grand total to 4.3 GB of online storage with [Mozy](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG)!

This is fantastic as I have more than enough room for all of my files. But, in the interest of keeping my consumption low, I have remove certain files from the backup:

- All my music: mainly because I can get it again :)
- All my source code: its stored on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") anyway.
- Emails: I use Google Mail and have masses of space from them anyway.

This means that I have plenty of free space (I am only at 66% ish usage) for all those word docs and presentations.

Now I have a couple of family members signed up I can see that [Mozy](https://mozy.com/?code=8R96AG) really is easy to use as with only a [few minutes reading](https://mozy.com/support) all my relatives were able to actually understand what they were getting and why...

Again I would like to thank a few guys for their mega byte support:
