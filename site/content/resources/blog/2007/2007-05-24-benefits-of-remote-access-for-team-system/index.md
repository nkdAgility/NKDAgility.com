Remote access for Team Server is about disparate teams. This means that you can use those cheep contractors in eastern Europe without needing to give them a small project because of the difficulties in integrating their work.

Essentially you use SSL with Active Directory to secure the services and sites while giving them controlled access to the system.

If you use the work items to track all the tasks you will be able to seamlessly and effectively build solutions much to big for your company and extend your reach overseas.
