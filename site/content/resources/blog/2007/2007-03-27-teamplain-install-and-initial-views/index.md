Well, I got TeamPlain installed in about 30 seconds on my dev servers. In fact, it went so well that after about 10 minutes of messing around with it, I installed it in production as well.

This is a fantastic piece of web work, it has all of the features that you could want from web access. The only problem I have encountered is that My project names are quite long! "XXEMEA-UK-Area-Dept-BusinessUnit-\[Project Name\]" and this does not display in the project drop down list provided, it cuts off around "XXEMEA-UK-Area-Dept-BusinessUn.." so you have to guess on the project it is referring to! I will probably have to rename the projects, no mean feet, to remove at least "XXEMEA-UK-" to make this usable, but at least my users will stop complaining about VS2005.![](images/r_teamddl.JPG)

I am still trying to work out how you control access to projects! Even though users have no permissions for a particular project: I am thinking that removing "Team Foundation Valid Users" from the project will work, I just have not had time to test it...
