I have just read a good [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/viking/archive/2007/07/20/software-factories-illustrated-storyboard.aspx "Software Factories Illustrated StoryBoard") by [Erik Gunvaldson](http://blogs.msdn.com/viking "Viking quest") from Microsoft. In it he explains why we want to use software factories and he provides a nifty storyboard to get across the ideas.

This sort of work will go a long way to making software factories more accessible, and push the understanding of the need for Software Factories to the next level.

Plus, I like the pretty pictures...
