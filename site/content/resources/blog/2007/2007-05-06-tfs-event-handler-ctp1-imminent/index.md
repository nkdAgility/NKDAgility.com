I have decided to go the same root as MS and use the Community Technology Preview (CTP) structure for my releases as there are quite a few people interested in using the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler).

I am working this week on getting [TFS Event Handler CTP1](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=3910) up and running with the full initial functionality. As I am off work this week I should have plenty of time for this, but my wife also want me to paint the house ;), so we will see...

Here is where I find out that I can't connect to the CodePlex [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Servers!
