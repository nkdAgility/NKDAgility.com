Well, its my first day at Aggreko, and I am loving their efficiency...I was handed a laptop uplon entering the office, and they had my login ready :)

This is the first company that I have worked for that could get this right...

My first job is researching and deploying Sharepoint, which I will need to come up with a plan for...

Hmm, I think I [blogged](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/24/Sharepoint-planning.aspx) about that recently...

They already have a wicked farm setup, but with nothing on it. And there are masses of propriatory workflow and applciations to migrate...Thisis not a small job.
