Well, today I started a new part time job that I do not get paid for, but put just as much professional interest into as may main job.

I will be moderating the submissions on a really cool site:

I have just spent my first morning vetting entries, and by and large I have not had to reject very many. This shows that the community that surrounds this site it pretty honest.

I have had plenty of time today, as I am unemployed this week, and I have managed to get through most of the submissions, well those in English anyway...

When I get back to the grind, I am sure that I will not have as much time to spend, but I want to do this: I benefit from this community (won a prize last month) and want to give something back.

You can view the credits I have attained by going to [http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk](http://community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)
