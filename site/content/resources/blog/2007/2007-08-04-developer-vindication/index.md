The biggest vindication of your .Net developer status would be if Microsoft wanted to employ you! And it happened to me...

I recently blogged about maybe being [interested in a career change](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx), and [Siddharth Bhatia](http://blogs.msdn.com/sbhatia/default.aspx), a Group Program Manager from Microsoft posted a [comment](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx#138860 "Siddharth Bhatia comment") asking to get in touch.

We had a lengthy conversation that ended in him asking if I would be interested in a position in Redmond. I should note that he did not at any time offer me a position as there is a lengthy process at Microsoft to get to that stage.

Obviously I said yes and he got one of his development managers, [Scot Gellock](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/04B/946), to email me and go through the preliminary's. This is where we ran into a problem...a Visa problem.

As I understand it, I would require a [H1B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1B_visa) vista to work in the US. These are in limited supply, start only on 1st September and it it too late to apply...

I am not giving up on this, but there are few other options...
