I have upgraded and [release](http://servicemanager.codeplex.com/) some code for the [managed service factory](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/articles/Creating-a-managed-service-factory-Article.aspx) that I wrote about earlier in the year. I have started the internal documentation process and the installer will install it to the GAC so you can use it in any of your applications... More to follow.
