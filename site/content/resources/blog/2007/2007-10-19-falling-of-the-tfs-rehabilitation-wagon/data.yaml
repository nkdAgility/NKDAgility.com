  - "<p>And here I though I was waving good buy to <a title=\"Team Foundation Server\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">TFS</a> in the short term, but here I am Installing it for <a href=\"http://www.aggreko.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Aggreko</a>. My boss\_came to me a couple of days ago and asked for a Work Item Tracking system in SharePoint 2007. I did my best, but as the requirements got more complicated and the metrics that they wanted to report on exploded, I said that TFS was the answer...</p> <p>This is not just a deployment of TFS for the purposes of tracking development projects. Nor is it only to be used for non-IT projects, but across the board of our companies project management. If I can prove that it will work :)</p> <p>Some of the features that they have hinted at I know will not be there until Rosario is available, and other features will require some amount of customization, especially some of the\_fleet utilization capabilities we want to build in among other things.</p> <p>In the short term we want to use as many of the out of the box functionality as possible, but major customizations are on the way... I will need to resurrect my <a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventhandler\" target=\"_blank\">TFS Event Handler</a> for some of the things we have been discussing and implement the Windows Workflow functionality that I threatened to do before.</p> <p>On that note, and to bring SharePoint 2007 properly into the mix...has anyone setup any Business Data Catalog stuff that points to SharePoint? Hmm, interesting...</p> <p><img alt=\"smile_teeth\" src=\"http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_teeth.gif\" /></p> <p>And just when the cost of Team Suit was getting me down I got an email from my good friend Jon Pratt\_from Microsoft UK saying that he had\_a spare copy of TFS 2005 and Team Suit 2005 sitting on his desk and would I like it <img alt=\"smile_wink\" src=\"http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_wink.gif\" />\_Its funny how things work out...</p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS\" rel=\"tag\">TFS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2005\" rel=\"tag\">TFS 2005</a>\_</div>"
