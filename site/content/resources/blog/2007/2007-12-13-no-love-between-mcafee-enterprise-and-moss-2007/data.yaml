  - "<p>Well I think I have found the root of the problem with my Microsoft office SharePoint Server 2007 dev box! It was McAfee\_ plain and simple.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Event Type:\_\_\_ Error<br />Event Source:\_\_\_ Windows SharePoint Services 3 Search<br />Event Category:\_\_\_ Gatherer <br />Event ID:\_\_\_ 2424<br />Date:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 13/12/2007<br />Time:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 09:36:06<br />User:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N/A<br />Computer:\_\_\_ GLA1VS09<br />Description:<br />The update cannot be started because the content sources cannot be accessed. Fix the errors and try the update again. </em> </p><p><em>Context: Application 'Search', Catalog 'index file on the search server Search' </em> </p><p><em>For more information, see Help and Support Center at </em><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp\"><em>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp</em></a><em>.</em></p></blockquote> <p>I get the above error about the Search Catalog repeatedly during the installation of SP1, and wrapped around it I get a bunch of IRC port block information items from McAfee. This is more than coincidence and I have requested that our infrastructure team remove McAfee from all SharePoint servers so we don't have this kind of problem in the future.</p> <p> Now, McAfee say that they support SharePoint Services 3.0, but MOSS has a bunch of extra features (Enterprise Search being one) that are not around in WSS. It seams that there are specific versions of Anti-Virus products for SharePoint Portal Servers and for good reason...</p> <p>Hopefully I can get this sorted soon.</p> <p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS\" rel=\"tag\">MOSS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint\" rel=\"tag\">SharePoint</a>\_</div>"

      Thanks so much for this post!  I was just going to the McAfee site to see
      if we could use Enterprise with our MOSS installation.  Now I know to be
      extra cautious.

      Thanks for the post.  I had McAfee loaded on my dev box and couldn't
      figure out what went wrong when I installed SP1 for MOSS.  I didn't get
      any errors during the install, but the event log was full of SQL
      connectivity errors after the upgrade.  <br />I am removing McAfee now to
      make sure all of the errors go away.  Unfortunately if this is the fix, we
      won't be installing SP1 in production anytime soon!

      This is not a Service Pack 1 issue! It is a general unsuported anti virus
      issue...
