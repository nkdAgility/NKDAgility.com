I have been thinking about the potential take-up of a private hosted [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") for small companies! This would be similar to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") but with much more control given to the project owners... i.e. custom Process templates, full work item suite and full customisation capabilities.

On 5/18/07 10:44 PM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
I think that we would be talking about a server per customer. This would provide the restriction on visability required by customers.

The advantage to a hosted service is that you (the customer) do not need any skills inhouse to manage or maintain team server. This will have an apeal to small and medium companies and those that do not have any development resource and wish to use team server to manage non-development projects.

On 5/20/07 12:27 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
I will need to look into the idea of Single-Sign-on, but I am dubious about its achievability. I think that the best we can hope for is a web interface that is single sign on but still require additional AD authentication for Source Control. I know that this is not what you want to hear, but [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") requires all users to be in the same domain...  
And I don't think that you want to expose your domain to a third party company!

On 5/20/07 12:31 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
To address latency, I think we would need to use a services like RackSpace, which, although expensive, provides very high connection speeds and low latency. The problem would be the expence!  
Have you used [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex")? This service is fast, I have been using it at home and work to manage a number of solutions that I work on and I do not find the speed a problem...

On 5/20/07 12:33 AM, Martin Hinshelwood added the following clarification:  
External access on [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") does not require VPN, which would slow it down. It is designed to be made availale over SSL using AD authentication.
