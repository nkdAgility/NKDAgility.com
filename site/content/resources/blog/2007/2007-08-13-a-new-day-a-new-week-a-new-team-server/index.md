I have just finished upgrading out [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Development environment to TFS2008 and I have to say it was a totally painless procedure...

The installation handles the upgrade perfectly (hopefully the RTM will work just as well) and I even created a new project with Visual Studio 2005, nice...

I now need to look at the Sharepoint integration and I will probably need to write a custom web service for Sharepoint to get the integration to work [how I want](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/20/Solution-to-sub-sites-in-Sharepoint-3.0-with-Team-Foundation.aspx).

Ah, well. At least I get to play with 2008!
