I have now added my [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") EventHandler to [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), but don't get too exited as I am currently mid refractor. I am moving to the more reliable Message Queuing for the system, and probably moving it to aÂ Windows Service instead of the current Website. I did actually start with web services but I found it more complicated to setup and create an install.

You can find the project under [TFSEventHandler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"), but I do not have a build for public consumption yet. I have used the [Microsoft Reference License (Ms-RL)](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/referencelicense.mspx) as I may market it, but it will be free for a long time yet.

With that in mind, I will be doing some level of documentation for the system.

Fancy joining in then give me a shout over at the [forum](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=9761).
