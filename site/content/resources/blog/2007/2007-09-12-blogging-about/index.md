Well, I have not done one of these is a while...I could say that I have been busy, but I have not been :)

I have been finishing up at Merrill Lynch in lue of starting my new job at Aggreko, and as I finished up on Friday, and I don't start till Monday, you could say that I am currently Unemployed. If only for a week...

After my [woefully presentation](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/06/Developing-Peer-To-Peer-Applications-With-WCF.aspx) last Monday and my lack of knowledge on CLR, I have vowed to rectify the defect in the depth of my knowledge. This will not be hard, but I will need to re-buy the CLR book that I had as it was returned to ML along with all of the books I bought for my [MCPD training](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx).

Well, in the last month (yes I know I said I would do this every week) I have:

- [upgrade](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/13/A-new-day-a-new-week-a-new-Team-Server.aspx) a server from [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") 2005 to TFS 2008 Beta 2. With absolutely no problems, except those I made for myself and expected...
- [assisted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/14/Team-Foundation-Server-Error-TF30177--Team-Project-Creation-Failed.aspx) with the Installation of a TFS server in the USA, and helped them with many [errors](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/20/Team-Foundation-Server-Error-TF30177-Team-Project-Creation-Failed.aspx). All of which I had had during my deployment to the same infrastructure...
- started reading about [Sharepoint and BizTalk](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/19/Studying-for-the-new-job.aspx), although I have to confess I have not got far through the books...
- written an [About Me](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/20/About-Martin-John-Hinshelwood.aspx) page for my blog as a one stop for lots of info about me...
- started looking at [VS2008 and its features](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/20/Using-Visual-Studio-2008.aspx). Its my sole development platform at home as my trial of Team Suit 2005 has expired...
- writing a [multi-part article](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/21/TFS-Event-Handler-in-.NET-3.5.aspx) on how to create a [TFS Event Handler](http://tfseventhandler.codeplex.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)...I'm at [part 2](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/07/TFS-Event-Handler-in-.NET-3.5-Part-2---HandlingAgain.aspx) at the moment...
- [interviewing for a job](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/09/12/Interviewing-for-Microsoft.aspx) at Microsoft...
- Oh, and playing with my beautiful 3 month old baby girl...

That's about it for now...Back to my unemployment :), and enjoying the rare Scottish sun...
