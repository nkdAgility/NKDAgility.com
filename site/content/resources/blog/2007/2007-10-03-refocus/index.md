You may have noticed that over the last month or so I have been neglecting my blog (too many personal posts) and my focus on development in general. This has been a temporary setback due mostly to starting a new job and not getting to play with Team Server at the moment (plus I had a knee operation the other week). So for now, I will be trying to focus more on Sharepoint 2007 / MOSS and the feature deficient Sharepoint 2003.

My new job entails maintaining a heavily customized Sharepoint 2003 deployment and some other nick knacks, while deploying MOSS for the company I am now with. I am quickly expanding my knowledge of Sharepoint from that additional bit bolted onto Team Foundation Server to a more rounded look at its enterprise deployment and integration with other systems.

I will need to migrate and integrate a number of other applications into MOSS including:

- Sharepoint Server Portal
- over 500 team sites in Sharepoint 2003 (Created over time, with no structure...Oh my!)
- a BI Portal built on Reporting Services and Crystal Reports
- an extensive intranet that incorporates many Sharepoint like features and an extensive custom workflow system
- an HR Administration function site

This is not an exhaustive list, but those applications that I have either found or been made aware of, and it does not by any measure include the future work already being talked about within the company on workflow and automation.

At least I have some help, a nice guy from New Iberia (Hi Michael!) and a Gal from Chicago who are both currently snowed under with the current work on the systems.

This should be fun...
