I have found a site with a list of many of the [applications](http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx "Team System Widgets") available for Team System. It seams to be updated regularly and should help with some of the v1 shortcomings of team Foundation Server.

[http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx](http://accentient.com/widgets.aspx "Team System Widgets")

I am particularly interested in the [TeamPlain](http://www.devbiz.com/teamplain/webaccess/ "TeamPlain") web products from [DevBiz](http://www.devbiz.com "TeamPlain"). The web interface is sorely lacking in TFS, but at least one can develop against the platform extremely easily.

Has anyone used TeamPain?
