I know that you are not supposed to do it, but I updated my phone to [Windows Mobile 6 Black](http://wmblack.info/), specifically Black 4 (Shadow). This is a fantastic ROM and, if you are not that technical, much better than trying to cook your own! It is described as a Hybrid OEM of [HTC Hermes](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctytn.html) and [Touch](http://www.htctouch.com/) designed specifically for the Hermes. This is good as the current [HTC Touch](http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctouch.html) phone does not have 3G or a keyboard, it looks fantastic though. I knew the iPhone would be good for something, pushing HTC to advance the interface!

I have to say that I enjoy updating my phone. I enjoy cooking my own ROM, I just don't always have the time, so this is a grate option. You still need to know some background to be able to do this, but there is an excellent tutorial from [Mr Vanx](http://www.mrvanx.org) called [Windows Mobile 6 Black Shadow (4.0)](http://www.mrvanx.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&Itemid=26), which gives you step by step advice on what to do, which as this is only the sixth or seventh update I have done, I still needed to read every line thoroughly.

I can confirm that this OS update worked perfectly (for me) and I even updated my Radio to the latest version( which if you have a [SPV M3100](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly) from Orange you will know that it needs it). For those that don't know what I am talking about; this is the stage in the update process where you are most likely to "brick" you phone, this is a commonly used team for turning your phone into a paperweight. Which would suck...

Having performed a successful update I am happy with the result and will probably keep it at least until some other ROM catches my eye!

**How have your updates gone?**
