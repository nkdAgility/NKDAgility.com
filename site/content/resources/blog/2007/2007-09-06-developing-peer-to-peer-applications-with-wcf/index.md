I recently had the need to create and deliver a presentation on [Developing Peer-To-Peer Applications With WCF](http://presentations.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Developing%20Peer-To-Peer%20Applications%20With%20WCF.pptx). Although the technical content was good, my delivery was not. I got stage fright...

As I approached the room to give the presentation in which I expected to see a couple of people, I was horrified to hear a clamor of voices, no, a venerable din of idle conversation coming from the room. _Not that room, please..._ but that was indeed the room, and I had to give my presentation to more than 25 highly technical people...It was fortunate at least that I had a copy of all of my notes, as my mind (what little was left after a day of traveling) dribbled slowly out of my ears...

I had previously [presented on VSTS](http://skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/self.aspx/Public/Visual%20Studio%20Team%20System/VSTS%20Presentation.ppt), but that was to a room of coworkers that somehow seamed less threatening. In addition I knew the content back to front and did not have any notes anyway. The 45 minute [Visual Studio Team System](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/default.aspx "Visual Studio Team System") presentation ended up taking 3 hours.

So, needless to say, I ended up having to almost totally read from my notes. Not the best way to do a presentation...

Anyway, here it is...

I owe a lot of thanks to the authors of [Pro WCF: Practical Microsoft SOA Implementation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pro-WCF-Practical-Microsoft-Implementation/dp/1590597028) without which I would not have been able to put the presentation together in three days at all.
