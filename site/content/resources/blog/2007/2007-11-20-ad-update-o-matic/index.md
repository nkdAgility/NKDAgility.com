In my quest to

play with test VB 9.0 and it very cool  features I created a little application to update Active Directory. I was asked by my boss (Andre) to get some sense of order into Active Directory for the users that will be involved in the proof of concept for MOSS 2007. So I immediately thought of an application to automate this.

The idea was to pull the information from AD for the selected users into a database and then make all the changes that are required there before updating AD with the new values.

This works very well, but I am unable to test most of the AD update procedures as I only have permission to update my own Office and telephone number fields; Which work just fine...

One of the guys from infrastructure are coming over this afternoon to run the application under his login, which will be a full test ![smile_omg](images/smile_omg-2-2.gif) I hope nothing goes wrong...
