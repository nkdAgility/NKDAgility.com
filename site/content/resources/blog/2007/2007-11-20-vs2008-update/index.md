Well it seems that Microsoft took the generally felt community suggestion and bundles Team Explorer with Visual Studio 2008 team Suit. I don't know if they did the same with VS2008 Pro or the other version, but it would seem a good idea.

I had a few problems uninstalling Beta 2, but I got there in the end and now have VS2008 RTM and MSDN installed, and I am just waiting for Team Explorer's install to complete.

Then I will see if all my projects from beta 2 need upgraded and wither the source control copes with it. I will defiantly try the upgrade in a branch to make sure I don't totally "gub" my projects ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif)

This afternoon I will be attending a Microsoft event in Edinburgh "[MSDN: SharePoint Developers](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-GB&eventid=1032355353)" which should be interesting, and then I have a wee meeting with the folks in MS tomorrow to go over anything that was missed and to discuss my companies impending MOSS 2007 deployment.

A busy couple of days...
