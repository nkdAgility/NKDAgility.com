Well I just got through simplifying my blog categories! I just though they were, well... rubbish,  and there were too many of them. I have toned them down and added a full description for them all with links to the relevant Wikipedia pages...

I have simplified the article categories as well...

Suggestions for Julian:

Can we not get the number of posts or articles to appear next to the category?

And what about a friendly category URL?

How about the digg this links on the blog pages as well as on the main feed?

Just some thoughts! Don't ask, don't get.
