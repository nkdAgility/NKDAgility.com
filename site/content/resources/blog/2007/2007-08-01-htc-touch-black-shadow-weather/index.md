If you want to have you city displayed in the HTC Weather Home screen then you need to do some editing!

My colleague Ajay just purchased a HTC Touch yesterday from Orange and he was upset that Glasgow was not listed in the cities.

Now, I have a SPV M3100 with Black Shadow installed so I though that they way I fixed mine would work... But no, you need to do some registry hacking to get it to work on the HTC Touch as the file you need to change is on the ROM and not in an editable part of the phone.

HTC Touch instructions: [Local weather on the HTC Touch](http://blog.commsconsulting.co.uk/2007/07/26/local-weather-on-the-htc-touch/ "Local weather on the HTC Touch")

If you have a Black OS / Other HTC: [HTC Homeplug Weather fix - get your LOCAL weather! CAB files now available!](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=319187 "HTC Homeplug Weather fix - get your LOCAL weather! CAB files now available!")

The registry edit is easier if you have an officialÂ Touch, but I was able to simply edit the xml file and save it without any extra complicatedness...
