With my lack of time to work with TFS at work in anything but a server maintenance and user assistance role, or even any sort of Visual Studio work, I will need to find a way to continue to access and work with Team System.

The other problem is that the only current hosted TFS solution is CodePlex and the guys at CP, in an effort to reduce load, have disabled almost all of the functionality.

I will need to get up and running at home. This will allow me to hone my TFS skills and improve my knowledge even better than at work as I can do anything I need to the server.
