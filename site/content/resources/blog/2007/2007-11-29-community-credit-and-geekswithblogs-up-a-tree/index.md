It is fantastic news that [GeeksWithBlogs.net](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2007/11/28/117209.aspx) and [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/community_credit_news/archive/2007/11/29/GeeksWithBlogs-is-now-Integrated-with-Community-Credit-_2D00_-Woo-Hoo_210021002100_.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage) have now both said their vows and are now fully integrated with each other. Awww, so cute.

A long and happy integration to you both...
