All you have to do to become a multi-dimensional free thinker is to change the way you think of your dyslexia. The benefits of having dyslexia far outweigh the negatives: The concepts of multi-dimensional thinking are incredibly difficult to learn if you have not been born with the ability, and if you are dyslexic, you have.

The advantages of Multi-Dimensional thinking is that you can visualize problems from all different angles and provide a solution that would not have occurred to a linear thinker. Although [Sigmund Void](http://www.sigmundvoid.com/?p=75 "The gift that keeps giving.") mentioned three dimensional thinking, the capability of thinking in more than three dimensions can assist you enormously if you are a software developer.

I am not saying that all dyslexic people can think in more than three dimensions, but they are all **capable** of it: not everyone is...

The advantages of being a Free Thinker are also incalculable. It adds a creative element to the way your brain works and makes incredibly complex ideas seam simple. The disadvantage is getting others to understand you, but this is off-set by dyslexic people usually having superb oral skills.

Professions for such talented people include but is not limited to:

engineers, architects, designers, artists and craftspeople, mathematicians, physicists, physicians (esp. surgeons and orthopedists), dentists, it professionals (esp. Software Development Engineers, Developer Evangelists and Software Architects).
