[RE: What I Hate About XBAPs](http://nerddawg.blogspot.com/2006/11/re-what-i-hat...)

Ahh, had I only searched the web a little longer...

I now have a problem! With the inability to send XBAP by email highlited in this blog. Ever since I saw an early MS video presentation on the capabilities of Vista I have longed for this feature. I don't think that this is a "nice-to-have" feature; in fact I think it an integral tool to the WPF arsenal, and Microsoft's integrated computing philosophy.

Why would you not want to send XBAP's via email:

- Presentations
- Forms
- Demos

Need I say more...
