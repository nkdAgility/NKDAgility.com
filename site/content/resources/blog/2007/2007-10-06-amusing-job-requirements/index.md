I recently received a job spec that had the most ridiculous "Required" skill set for an "Analyst Programmer". I though I should share it with you as I have just spent the last 10 minutes cleaning tea out of my keyboard with cotton bud's. Here is how it was presented in the email:

> _\* C# Java Script Java  
> \* ASP.NET 1.1 ASP.NET 2.0 J2EE  
> \* Visual Studio 2003 SOA Visual Basic  
> \* Winforms Development Visual Studio 2005 Linux  
> \* SQL Server 2000 (TSQL and Database Design) AJAX Data Cleansing  
> \* Full Life-Cycle SQL Server 2005 SMS  
> \* Object Oriented Design Multi-channel CRM IVR  
> \* Strong verbal and written communication skills Call Centre UML  
> \* Organisational and problem solving capabilities ISO9000_

Now obviously this list was formulated by someone who has no idea what these things are, so lets brake that up into a proper list...

**Skills Required:**

- C#
- Java Script
- Java
- ASP.NET 1.1
- ASP.NET 2.0
- J2EE
- Visual Studio 2003
- SOA
- Visual Basic
- Winforms Development
- Visual Studio 2005
- Linux
- SQL Server 2000
- TSQL
- Database Design
- AJAX
- Data Cleansing
- Full Life-Cycle
- SQL Server 2005
- SMS
- Object Oriented Design
- Multi-channel CRM
- IVR
- Call Centre
- UML
- ISO9000

I can't imagine anyone actually knowing how to do all of these things. If they do, they would only have a cursory knowledge of  each think and be useless at programming any one of these. I could understand this for a Architect or Evangelist role where depth of knowledge is not required. But for a programmer there is a necessity to concentrate on one technology at a time, and only with 2-3 years commercial experience would you be considered "good" at it.

Whoever this employer is needs to come to the realisation that this is about 5 (or more) roles all mashed together:

- Architect
- .NET Developer
- Java Developer
- Web Developer
- SQL Developer

If I am wrong, please let me know! And if you are one of these "Uber-Analyst Developers" then...well, I don't believe for a moment that you could actually do all of these things well...

**Advice for an employer:** If you are an employer, only define a list of the absolute essential skills. If you find someone good enough at those, then they can learn the bits and bobs that go with the others.

**Advice for a job seeker:** If you are a prospective employee, don't lie and say that you know all of these things (I have interviewed my fare share of people who did), but instead say that you know a set of core things, and that you can learn the rest...

**Advice for everyone:** I am not saying that it is the holy grail or anything, but read [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), many of his articles are just common sense, but other are down right genius (and, no, I am not looking for a job at [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com) ;).
