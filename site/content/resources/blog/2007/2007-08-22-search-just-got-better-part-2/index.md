After my post on the new [Tafiti](http://www.tafiti.com/) search engine a fellow by the name of [Anselm](http://www.searchcrystal.com/) pointed out [Search Crystal](http://www.searchcrystal.com "http://www.searchcrystal.com"), another visual search engine that produces some good result. I did not get he same Wow that I did from Tafiti, but the amount of information that is provided through the interface is extensive.

You can change the display of the results from Cluster (the default) to Spiral and list. I did find that the List option is very confusing and difficult to navigate, and the Spiral option seams of limited use to me personally. It was a good idea to use the cluster view as the default and I think they have put the most work into this part of the system.

All in all, it is very good, but I think that from a visual perspective the Tafiti interface works better, al be it with only one search engine.

Below you can see an example of the search results, and you should be able to play with it. This does indeed work on Virtual Workstations, while the tree view from Tafiti has some problems due to the slow refresh.

Have you seen any other search visualization website's? Let me know...
