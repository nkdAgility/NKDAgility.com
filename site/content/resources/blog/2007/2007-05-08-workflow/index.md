I am thinking of adding WF support to my Team Foundation Server Event Handler, but I am interested in a discussion on the topic of the how's and wherefores. I have seen a lot of people implementing Workflow for Team Server and this would provide them a host system.

I have started a discussion on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"): [Workflow Implementation](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler/Thread/Vie...)

Users could write workflow and host it in the current system, but what I envision would allow users to edit the workflow in a hosted environment and allow them to alter the workflow on the fly!

Thoughts anyone?
