A few months ago I found a cool site called [Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com). I did not understand the premise at first, but after seeing the prizes page, I thought, what the heak! Community Credit is the brain child of one David Silverlight, and yes, it is quite possible that "Silverlight" was named after him :). What is this wondrous site you may ask...Well, its part bragging, part recognition, and part prizes :)

I thought, "this is fantastic, getting prizes for what I am doing anyway", and started posing all of the things I have been involved in to do with technology.

In my second month of posting I tore the cartilage in my knee (Ouch!) and so with nothing to occupy my tiny brain and noting that David was looking for moderators I emailed him to see if I fitted the bill. And I did!

David just [posted](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/community_credit_news/archive/2007/11/29/Thanks_2C00_-Martin-Hinshelwood_2C00_-you-Saved-the-Day.aspx) a nice recognition blog about it...thanks David...what about some extra credit :)
