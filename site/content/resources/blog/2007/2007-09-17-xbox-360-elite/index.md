Wohoo, I traded my sometimes crashing Xbox 360 in for an Xbox 360 Elite in Saturday. Over the last two weeks I have been playing Bioshock to death, but the crashing finaly anoyed me enough to get it sorted.

I could either have sent my Xbox away to Microsoft to fix for £150 (no ring of death :() or trade it in for £140 with a couple of games that I do not play any more and get an Elite for £105. it was a no brainer...

To sweeten the deal, I got Medal of Honor: Airbourn for a tenner and ponied up for Stranglehold, which I have been playing constantly...

I love my Xbox :)
