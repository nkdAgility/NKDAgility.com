I ran into a small problem with the tfs admin tool.

When you add a user to a project as "Contributer" then it adds only "Publisher" to the reporting services permissions.

This is in fact wrong and should also add "Reader" otherwise you get lots of emails from users who can't view the reports!

This is a minor problem to fix, unless you only notice it after you have created 100 projects... Doh!
