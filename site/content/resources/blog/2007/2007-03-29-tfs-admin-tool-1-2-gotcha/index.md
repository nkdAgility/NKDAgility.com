I ran into a small problem with the tfs admin tool.

When you add a user to a project as "Contributer" then it adds only "Publisher" to the reporting services permissions.

{ .post-img }

This is in fact wrong and should also add "Reader" otherwise you get lots of emails from users who can't view the reports!

This is a minor problem to fix, unless you only notice it after you have created 100 projects... Doh!
