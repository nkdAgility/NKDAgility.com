[Jeff Julian](//geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/) who kindly provides my blog has been [blogging](http://geekswithblogs.net/jjulian/archive/2007/06/22/113388.aspx "SharePoint Content Request | What would you like to see?") about what features would be good in Sharepoint.

I would like to see all of the capabilities of TeamPlain for Team Foundation Server built into Sharepoint. With versions for both technical and non technical people.  
This would allow a much more versatile integration of [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") into ones own intranet and allow the use of TFS for other things than just development...

The current capabilities of TFS are sorely under utilized as any system that uses a process flow can be integrated with it: From a Ticketing system to hotel service desk. If you are tracking information and want to see how you are performing then TFS can provide a solution.

At the moment the licensing model is prohibitive for this, but with an enterprise edition of Team Foundation Server _likely_ to be in the works ;) I would think that this would change...
