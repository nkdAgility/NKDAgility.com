I found out the other day that there is another implementation of TFS in the company. Not even the principal UK Architect, who recently visited the US knew of this. I do not think that it has been communicated outside of the department. That is an inevitable aspect of such a large company. The only way to get things working is to keep your head down until you have a viable solution, otherwise you get blown out of the water as soon as department z resizes that you product my do away with their solution for one part of of a larger system. Sillyness...

The only way to get ahead in this industry is to get the software out of the door more quickly than the competition. Last year, our company made billions because they worked out a way to get the data to the traders 600 milliseconds faster than the competition! Now, this is an extreme example, but it highlights the speed of the industry.

In the sector that I work in, mortgages, the winner is the one who can sell the most mortgages and securitize more often. That means that the information available to the management the collection of the original data, needs to be up-to-date, correct and comprehensive.

To do this we need to industrialize our activities. This means that we need solid reuse of components that have already been tested and stabilized. We need those components to be able to be used on "the factory floor" to produce highly scalable application quickly.

Team Foundation Server can provide this. I am not saying that it will provide this to everyone, just as a production line does not make every factory successful. But the facility is now there to provide an infrastructure to working collaboratively on IT projects that Outlook just does not mat

Just as there was an industrial revolution over the steam engine in the early 19th centaury and one in the 1920's witchery Fords production line, Team Foundation Server will push IT into a revolution of its own...
