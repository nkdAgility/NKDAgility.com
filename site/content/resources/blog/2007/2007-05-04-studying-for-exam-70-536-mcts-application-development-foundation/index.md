After my success with [Beta Exam 71-510: TS: Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server](http://hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/04/25/Beta-Exam-71-510-TS-Visual-Studio-2005-Team-Foundation-Server.aspx) I now find myself thinking that I should get my developer exams sorted. I had never done them before as I would have had to pay for them myself. Which sucks...

The company I am now working for (the first to have more than 30 employees, and has more than 70,000) has kindly decided that I get a training budget. Now, though the budget is large, it would only cover one and a half of the exam courses per year and I can't be bothered to take 4 years to do it, by which time they will be obsolete anyway, so I have decided to go for the self study approach.

I am studying for my [Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD)](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/) of the [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) flavor. As I have no previous MCP experience I will need to do five exams:

- [Exam 70–536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation
- [Exam 70–526](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-526.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Windows-Based Client Development
- [Exam 70–528](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-528.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Web-Based Client Development
- [Exam 70–529](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-529.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Distributed Application Development
- [Exam 70–549](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-549.asp): PRO: Designing and Developing Enterprise Applications by Using the Microsoft .NET Framework

So I am starting at the bottom and working my way up. First is exam 70-536, the problem is that I have been doing .NET development for 6 years and .NET 2.0 for 2 of those. This means that 80% of things I know already which makes the books rather boring!

Ah well, back to the book!
