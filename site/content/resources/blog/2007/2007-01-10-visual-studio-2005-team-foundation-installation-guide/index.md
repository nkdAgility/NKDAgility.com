The TFS guys have just updated the [Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Installation Guide](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=E54BF6FF-026B-43A4-ADE4-A690388F310E&displaylang=en "Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Installation Guide") to a new version released on 4/1/2007 and it incorporates all of the SP1 updates.

I have been browsing the documentation for a while now and the main differences are that the guide now includes SP1 in the install procedures. Another change is that it also includes instructions on installing Reporting Services and Analytical Services on a separate server.

I think that I will be using much of this content for my documentation for our Infrastructure department.

I am looking forward to the Admin Guide being updated as well!

How has everyone got on with their TFS implementations?
