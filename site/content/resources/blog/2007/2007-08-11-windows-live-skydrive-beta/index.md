I was reading Mike Tautly's post on SkyDrive so I thought I should have a look.

I found it extremely easy to use and solves the problem of my blog not supporting file uploads.

I have a link to my [SkyDrive](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public) on the left of my blog and I have uploaded my first public file, my [CV](http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/Resume). I will add more files in the future...

What I would like to see on the SkyDrive is more Sharepoint style interaction so I can edit my files directly on the online drive.
