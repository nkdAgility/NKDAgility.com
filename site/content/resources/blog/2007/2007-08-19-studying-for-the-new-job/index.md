I will be [starting a new job](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/16/A-change-for-the-better.aspx) in around a month and I wanted to get up-to-speed with the technologies that the new company want to be using. To start with I have had a look at a number of certifications:

- [Technology Specialist: BizTalk Server 2006](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/biztalk/)
- [Technology Specialist: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Application Development](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/spservices/appdev/)
- [Technology Specialist: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Configuration](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/spservices/config)

These will be on top of the [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx) exams (all 5 of them) that I have already started studying for. Although this is a tall order, I will be buying these books as an added encouragement to myself to get off my lazy arse and read them:

For BizTalk I bought:

The reason for the WF book is that, with the impending release of BizTalk 2006 R2, support for WF and [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation") will be part of the application.

For Sharepoint 2007:

{ .post-img }

I know that this is not a MOSS book, but you need to start somewhere and there are no exams for MOSS yet, too new. Although I have asked to be put on the beta list for Sharepoint 2007, MOSS 2007 and .NET 3.0 exams...
