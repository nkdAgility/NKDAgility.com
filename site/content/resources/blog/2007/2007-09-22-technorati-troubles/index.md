Recently I have been having real trouble with Technorati. I have been trying to mop up my loose blog claims and I have been having a problem. Technorati seems unable to get a lock on redirected URL's, I don't see why that would be an issue, but it is. In a effort to try to remedy this problem I have put all of my claim codes here:

The other problem that I seam to have is the TAG cloud that is created seams to contain main invalid tags. By that I mean things that are no tags at all, but page names, or folder names. I am not sure what is going on here, and emailing Technorati support produces no results...

Ah well, I will see if this works...

_UPDATE:_

_Nope, not working._
