Well, I have spent the afternoon delving into the features of SharePoint 3.0. As an extensive [Team Foundation Server](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") user I have had a lot of exposure to SharePoint 2.0 and I always found it kinda _crap_...

I was very surprised to find  that this new version is quite good. I will eventually need a book to get to grips with the more complicated aspects of the system. But I managed to put together an intranet for my department in the same afternoon that I installed and set it up...not bad.

I will let you know how I get on with the rest of the configuration. I am really looking forward to WF in SharePoint...
