Does anyone remember the early video presentations for Vista? Specifically the one about the students collaborating on coursework? The bit I am interested in is the emails with advanced content... Can we do that now?

The demonstration showed an email being opened and a 3d animated representation of the solar system being displayed with the senders calculations for getting a probe into orbit of one of the planets.

Now, this looks very much like WPF, and if so then it would be a xaml browser application being hosted in the email. I know that some people will be going "ooh, security nightmare", but surely if it is .NET and running in a sandbox then this would not be a problem.

I guess my question is:

Has anyone ever sent an xbap to anyone via email? Not a link, actually running in the email window. And if so, how?
