I am just writing some handover documentation for our [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") deployment in the office. Thank goodness that I wrote installation and disaster recovery documents when I originally deployed the system, other wise this would have been a very long process.

All I really need to do is reference those documents in a wrapper document that details of all of the servers and any online resources that I use.

TFS 2005 is a pain to install, but it is just fine to manage and over the last 8 months I have only had to log onto the server 3 times with one of them being to configure TFS 2005 to work with Sharepoint 2007.

I would always rather a painfully install than painfully management...
