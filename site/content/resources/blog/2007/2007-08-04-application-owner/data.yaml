  - "<p>In my company it is the job of someone in business\_technology to manage production applications. Personally I think that this is a job for a Project\_Manager, not a developer,\_as it is about management and is not particularly technical. You do not actually have to carry out any of the work on the application, just:</p> <ul> <li>Manage the relationship with the vendor</li> <li>Manage the infrastructure teams to keep the application running</li> <li>Manage all issues and problems with the application</li> <li>Manage any updates to the application</li> <li>Manage all access to the production system</li> <li>Manage\_any documentation for the system and its operation</li> <li>Manage SOX audits on applications that require it</li></ul> <p>This is no small task and incorporates only part of my job. When everything is well, there is little to do, but as usual everything happens at once.</p> <p>I currently own:</p> <ul> <li>Our general ledger application (soon to be decommissioned)</li> <li>All of our Mortgage Souring systems (around six applications)</li> <li>Visual Studio Team System (includes Team Explorer, Web Access to Team System, Office Integration, )</li> <li>a CRM that I built</li> <li>and a few others</li></ul> <p>I am performing a SOX audit on our general ledger application and all of our Mortgage Sourcing application have stopped working due mainly to the way they are built being incompatible with our infrastructure.</p> <p>Fixing these problems, or managing the solutions is slow and painfully. At least my company has just implemented a SOX audit management system that is taking the audit from two months last year to only a few weeks this year.</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Fail\" rel=\"tag\">Fail</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS\" rel=\"tag\">TFS</a>\_</div>"
