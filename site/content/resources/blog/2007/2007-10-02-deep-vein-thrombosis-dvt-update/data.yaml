  - "<p>Back in March I <a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/03/03/Deep_vein_thrombosis_DVT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> about my friend Katie McPherson that died of DVT and her family's <a href=\"http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=155\" target=\"_blank\">petition</a> calling for the Scottish Executive to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7024788.stm\" target=\"_blank\">introduce mandatory assessment</a> tools for all health boards for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis and to get all newborn babies tested for the \"Factor V\" gene that increases their susceptibility to the condition.</p> <p>I would like to share this email from my good friend Steven McPherson...</p> <blockquote> <p>Subject: Update on epetition for my sister </p><p><em>Hi all,</em> </p><p><em>Just a wee update on the above. Hope you will remember earlier this year you and many others very kindly signed the epetition for changes to the management and protocols for DVT as a result of the death of Katie.</em> </p><p><em>My parents were at the Scottish Parliament today (which they say is a truly horrendous building) to meet with the epetitions panel to discuss this petition further which I am pleased to say went very well. </em> </p><p><em>They were met there by newspapers and a TV crew, before and after they went into the parliament and the news clip can be found here </em><a href=\"http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002\"><em>http://www.stv.tv/content/news/health/display.html?id=opencms:/news/health/Call_for_DVT_screening_20071002</em></a><em>. If you wish to see the full 35mins of their presentation within the parliament drop me a line and I can forward this onto you. I am told it will appear on </em><a href=\"http://www.holyrood.tv/\"><em>www.holyrood.tv/</em></a><em> tomorrow under the archive section, although I have a copy of it if this is not the case. Both my parents did very well within the parliament making their points very clear and answering all the panels questions in great detail. </em> </p><p><em>I am aware from my good friend Martin there were also stories on the radio and teletext (of all places) today, covering this. My parents were interviewed by a number of press after the session, so no doubt this will appear in further papers/TV/radio etc tomorrow and over the remaining week.</em> </p><p><em>It appears that at long last we are beginning to make some head way. I believe the next stage is for the epetitions panel to look into the existing guidelines / protocols to establish the current situation and then look into how things can be changed for the future. </em> </p><p><em>I'm sure you don't need reminding but Katie would have been 28yrs old this Sunday.</em> </p><p><em>Main point of this email is to once again thank you for your support. In the end we managed to get 143 signatures for the epetition which is fantastic and would not have been possible without all your support.</em> </p><p><em>Many thanks and look forward to seeing you soon.</em> </p><p><em>Steven McPherson</em></p></blockquote> <p>The family have a Website \"<a title=\"http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/\" href=\"http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/\">http://www.dvt-awareness.co.uk/</a>\"\_ where they link to many news stories on the subject and a couple of videos. Although it is too late to sign the petition, please lend your support any way you can... </p><p>\_ </p><p>\_</p> <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      Hi Martin,<br /><br />I'm very sorry for not answering your questions
      (http://geekswithblogs.net/hinshelm/archive/2007/03/03/Deep_vein_thrombosis_DVT.aspx)<br
      /><br />That's the problem when commenting and forgetting to subscribe to
      the comments.<br /><br />Regarding my girlfriend's DVT: she smoked, was
      taking the contraceptive pill, had surgery a couple of days before because
      of a knee insury which was going on for almost three weeks. Several
      docters made mistakes, her leg was warmer en swollen (not red). She had a
      light fever. It became clear it wasn't the classic trombosis. We sued
      every single docter who was involved (6 in total) and are now patiently
      waiting for court. FYI, one of the docters told us a couple of months
      later she had never seen a DVT like this(how many dvt were not recognized
      by her....!) Here in the Netherlands whe have local docters, you have to
      go to them first before you are allowed to go to hospital, these people
      are also know as gatekeepers, tresspassing is not allowed... It's a sick
      world sometimes!<br /><br />Happy to read something again from you!

      Interesting comment this martin. Shocking to see that the UK isnt the only
      country who havent got a clue when it comes to detecting dvt's. This is
      what we are pushing for is reliable tests to determin if a dvt is present.
      At this time no doctor, hospital, nurse, health board within Scotland is
      permitted to use the term "dvt excluded" as per the scottish Ombusmans
      report re my sister. As they cannot prove if there is no dvt as at present
      theyre are no reliable tests to prove either way.<br />Interesting comment
      about this chap sueing though. We had looked at this and had full lawyers
      support. The NHS have something like £13million as a fighting fund to pay
      off claims against the nhs. If we were sueing I would go for £13,000,001
      just to teach the buggers a lesson. We took the decision not to sue as we
      couldnt put a price on Katie.<br />Good luck to him, would like to know
      how he gets on.<br /><br />Steve

      Hello,<br /><br />I had DVT in 2002 and a pulmonary thromboembolism. It
      started in May and I went to 3 doctors, all of them with different
      diagnosys, different medications and none with the right one. When I went
      to the fourth doctor (in the middle of June) it would be impossible not to
      see what I had. He said it was a miracle not to be dead.<br /><br />Four
      years later I got pregnant and my ginecologist told me that I should take
      a aspirin a day to reduce the risk of DVT (she should know that the
      aspirin does nothing in DVT problems and increases the risk of abortion).
      Guess what??? I had a miscariage and a new DVT.<br /><br />This time I
      tried to contact the doctor that made the other diagnose, but he was not 
      available. So I went to his clinic and ask to be seen by a doctor. I
      explained all my medical history and that I was having a DVT (because I
      know now what is like) and he told me that I was very nervous and that it
      was a muscular problem. As I insisted he called the other doctor who went
      to the clinic and confirmed my diagnose - DVT.<br /><br />It's terrible
      but doctors are not aware for this problem. So we all should advise our
      friends and relatives, because it can happen to every one.<br /><br
      />Patricia<br /><br />PS: My only risk factor was the contraceptive
      pill.<br /><br /><br /><br />

      Patricia,<br /><br />This is a shocking story, and I must say how sorry I
      am at your miscarraige.<br /><br />This is exactly what we are pushing for
      within the UK. We believe my sisters fatal DVT was also caused by the
      Contraceptive Pill.<br /><br />Have you ever been tested for the Factor V
      Liden gene?. Aswell as increasing your susceptability to DVT'S this gene
      also leads to miscaraige's. <br /><br />As you have no doubt read before
      on Martin's blogs, I am a carrier to this gene- (like approx 1 in 5 of the
      population) we can only assume my sister was to. It does not affect my
      life in the least, altho I am aware I must take regular breaks when sat
      for long periods of time (driving, sat at desk etc) as well as drinking
      plentyfluids before and after long haul flights.<br /><br />First thing I
      would reccommend is ask your doctor to be tested for the Factor V Liden
      gene. This is a simple blood test. If positive, you are at a higher risk
      of developing a dvt- mix this with taking the contraceptive pill, long
      haul flights (anything over 4hrs) etc, and we are at an even higher risk
      of developing a dvt and in a womens case unfortunately having a
      miscaraige.<br /><br />The WHO (World Health Organisation) have recently
      released an intersting paper, in which they highlight strongly the link
      between Factor V, the contraceptive pill, miscaraiges and DVT's. I will
      try and dig it out and post a link to it.<br /><br />Once again, hearing
      this story upsets me, but encourages my family and I to keep going to
      ensure not only that procedures are changed but we also highlight the
      links between DVT's, Factor V Liden, the contraceptive Pill and
      miscaraiges.<br /><br />Our case is currently in the hands of the msp's,
      gathering information. Although, we appear to be hitting a problem with
      insurance companies. The MSP's are concerned indiciduals who carry the
      factor V gene will not be covered by insurance companies for such things
      as travel insurance etc. Shocking really, but when I recently completed on
      my mortgage I was never asked any such question. <br /><br />Steven
