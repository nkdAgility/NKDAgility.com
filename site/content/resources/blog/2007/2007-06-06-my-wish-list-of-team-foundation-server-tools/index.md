**TFS Event Handler**

This tool would run on the TFS server and capture all of the soap events being generated by Team Server. These would then be passed to the Event Handler Manger that would send the event to all of the loaded Handlers. Handlers can be dynamically loaded in to the system by uploading a DLL from a client tool.

_I am currently working on this: [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/tfseventhandler)_

**TFS Event Handler for Workflow**

Same as the TFS Event Handler, but passes to any number of WF workflow's.

_I will probably work on this after the initial TFS Event Handler above..._

**TFS Submission for Business Users**

Submission is a simple implementation of the TFS work item creation forms, much simpler than TeamPlain, that allows non-IT people to add work items.

_I have started proof-of-concept work on this and currently the fields are hard coded. I am trying to interrogate the Team Foundation Server work item store to find all the required fields only and just display those, but I think it will need some sort of configuration utility to specify what fields are available for which projects over and above the default set. [TFS Submission](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSSubmission "Team Foundation Server Submission")_

**TFS Jira Sync**

A facility to allow the synchronization of projects with [Jira](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/).

**TFS Active BPEL Engine Sync**

A facility to allow the synchronization of projects with [Active BPEL Engine](http://www.activebpel.org).

**TFS Checkin Notifiers**

This tool would allow users to request (through VS2005) access to a file checked out to another user, and be notified when the file becomes available.

I have already [blogged](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/24/TFS-Feature-Wish-Request-Source-Access.aspx "TFS Feature Wish Request Source Access") about this.

> **TFS Sharepoint Sub-Site Creator**
>
> This is a customization to the project creation wizard that makes it compatible with sub sites without requiring  a Sharepoint managed path. You can create a site, or sub-site in Sharepoint and get TFS to create its projects as sub sites of that site. This would allow automatic integration with a company intranet implemented in Sharepoint.

**Does anyone have anything else on your wish lists?**
