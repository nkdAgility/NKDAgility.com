The first problem I have encountered in that in the past I have had various version of Office 2007 beta and other bits and bobs. You will need to remove these to install Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2.

If your install fails on or just after "**Microsoft Web Designer Tools**" then you probably have this problem. If you download the [Windows Installer Cleanup Utility](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301) you will be able to clean anything that is Office 2007 and beta from you system.

This worked for me, but I guess you may have other problems...

I am going to test this on my spare work computer and my laptop at home, but at home I will need to remove Vista to free up some RAM.

I want to be able to test Team Foundation Server 2008 as well, but I will need to wait for a new laptop for that...but I spec'ed one out on Dell and it came to £2900.

**Does anyone have a really kick ass laptop? Where did you buy it?**

I think that the min speck needs to be:

4GB of RAM - I need to be able to run Vista with Team Suit + VPC with Windows 2003 & [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server")

17" screen

Min resolution of 1900+

**Any ideas?**
