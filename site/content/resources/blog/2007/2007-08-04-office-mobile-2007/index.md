This week I installed Office Mobile 2007 on my Windows Mobile 6 ([Black Shadow](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/06/21/Windows-Mobile-6-Black-Shadow-4.0.aspx)) SPV M3100, and I have to say, what changed?

I can now see my RSS Feeds as part of Outlook Mobile 2007, but apart from that the only change was the addition of OneNote Mobile 2007.

I had already installed OneNote to assist with my note taking in the Office as my [writing sucks](http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/22/Memories-of-a-multi-dimensional-free-thinking-software-developer.aspx). OneNote also syncs with the desktop version and I could not now do without it.

It is good that this is a free update...
