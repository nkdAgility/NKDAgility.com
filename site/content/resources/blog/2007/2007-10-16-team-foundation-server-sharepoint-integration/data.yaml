  - "<p>Why is there not more integration found in Team Foundation Server\_\"out-of-the-box\" with SharePoint 2007. It seams obvious to me that you would want to show your Work Items in SharePoint and integrate SharePoint Workflow into Team Foundation Server. It only make sense to be able to initially create a SharePoint Work item that is a request from a user into SharePoint, have some sort of approval workflow before assigning it to a project within <a title=\"Team Foundation Server\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx\">TFS</a>.</p>\n<p>I think that <a href=\"http://bloggingabout.net/members/Mike-Glaser.aspx\">Mike Glaser</a>'s blog <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx\">post</a> on <em>\"</em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bloggingabout.net/blogs/mglaser/archive/2007/03/30/how-about-one-team-foundation-server-portal-i-had-a-dream.aspx\"><em>How about one Team Foundation Server portal? I had a dream!</em></a><em>\" </em>hits the nail exactly on the head. Why can we not view our bugs in SharePoint and create Change requests there?</p>\n<p>What would be excellent would be Mike's hierarchical project space. You should be able to create\_work items at the\_root level and then assign them to projects on the way down. This way, user, who have no idea what project a Change Request is for \_can create them in the central pool, and then the project manager or technical experts can filter them down into the actual project that the change is for.</p>\n<p>As a start, instead of releasing \"Web access for Team Foundation Server\" as a power tool, it should have been re-engineered into a set of web parts that can be integrated into SharePoint. That way we could have used the default site, or created our own custom components.</p>\n<p>Microsoft, if you are listening to either Mike or myself...please do not forget the Workflow integration too....</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Fail\" rel=\"tag\">Fail</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_</div>"

      Martin, Nice to know that there are more people, who find the current
      integration shoot too short. There are so many possibilities and the
      server products are ready for it. Some months a go I had a Usability Study
      with Yogita Manghnani as well. In this session I explained what I find of
      the current solution and how it could be better. Not only what I’ve
      written on my own blog, but also discussed why they should use more
      Business Intelligence within MOSS. BDC, Excel services, e.t.c. Let’s hope
      that more people read our blogs and start complaining. ;-).

      All I can say is, "Amen Brother"!<br /><br />If you happen to take a
      glance at my blog (http://portal.sqltrainer.com) I tend to write about TFS
      and Agile Business Intelligence. It's hard to be Agile when you have so
      many places to keep track of things!
