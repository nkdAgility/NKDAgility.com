One of the annoying things about Source-Control is that someone else can have that file you really need checked out! This can be annoying if they are not in the same building or even country.

What we need is a add-in for Team Explorer where we can right-click on a tree or file that has been checked out by another user and request access.

This will then notify the user that we want access and prompt them to check-in the file, or notify you that they are still using it.

Which would then prompt them every 10 minutes to check it in and prompt you to ask if you are still waiting for the file.

Once he has checked it in, your workspace is automatically updated and you are notified that you can now check out the file!

Possible [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") project "TFSCheckinNotifier".

Could be cool, what do you think?
