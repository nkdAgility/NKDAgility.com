Something I have noticed in writing an [article](http://www.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/archive/2007/08/21/TFS-Event-Handler-in-NET-3-5-Part-1-The-Architecture.aspx) is that the "Application diagram" in VS2008 does not support [Windows Communication Foundation](http://wcf.netfx3.com "Windows Communication Foundation"). This I think is an oversight even for Beta 2. Is this going to be in the RTM, I hope so as it would be virtually useless without it!
