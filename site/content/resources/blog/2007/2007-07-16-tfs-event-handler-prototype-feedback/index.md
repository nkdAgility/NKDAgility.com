I would be interested in finding out if anyone is using the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) I created on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex"). The main reason for this is to solicit feedback for the process and integration capabilities.

The [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler removes the need to integrate with the Team Foundation Server events. It provides a simple API for making decisions on what to do with event that are raised.

I am looking for the answer to the following questions:

1. Did you get it installed?
2. Did the configuration instructions provide enough information?
3. Did it start successfully?
4. Did it work as you expected?
5. Are you even interested in another version?

**Let me know!**
