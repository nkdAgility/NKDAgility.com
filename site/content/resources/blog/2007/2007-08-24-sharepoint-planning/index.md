I have been asking one of my colleagues for information on Sharepoint and how to deploy it to large organizations. He intoned that he new how not to do it and pointed me towards a particular [post](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2007/04/09/investing-in-logical-architecture-design-samples.aspx "Sharepoint planning") that defines a very effective deployment method.

In reading it I came to a much grater realization of not only the power of Sharepoint, but the scale that it can be deployed in. Although you have to take the entire potential architecture into consideration, I really like the MySites part of the deployment.

I think I am going to enjoy the Sharepoint thing...
