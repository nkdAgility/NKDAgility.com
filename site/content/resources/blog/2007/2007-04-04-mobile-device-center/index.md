The one thing I do not like about the mobile device center is that it can't sync with the built in windows vista components (Contacts, Calendar and email). This is, I think, a deficiency in the product.

I would have liked Outlook to also use these components (or to be able to choose to), as it would mean a single storage mechanism for all email clients on Vista.

From the early propaganda on Vista I had though that this was the point! But it seams that it was one of the things cut to get the thing out the door.

Hopefully Microsoft will rectify this over time...
