I thought I should take a leaf out of [Scott Dorman's](http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman/archive/2007/08/15/About.aspx "About Scott Dorman")Â book and post some information about me:

- [About Martin John Hinshelwood](http://blog.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/archive/2007/08/20/About-Martin-John-Hinshelwood.aspx)
- [Martin Hinshelwood's Resume](skydrive.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk/Public/Resume)
- [Martin Hinshelwood's LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)
- [Martin Hinshelwood's Community Credit](community-credit.multidimensionalfreethinking.co.uk)

I have tried to be concise, but I am sure that knowing some of the people that read my blog, I will get complaints. One of the reasons that I am posting this is that there is another Martin Hinshelwood who is the manager of Albion football club, and he gets a higher search engine ranking than me: My mission in life is to relegate football (Soccer for you Americans \[What is with American football anyway? Why all the pads? We play a similar game called Rugby without all padding! Much more satisfying.\]) in relation to my name a distant second to technology.

Ahh well, Scott is a much better writer than me, or he just has more patience...

I am sure that I will adapt it over time to better reflect my experience.
