I am half way through the MSMQ Refactor of my [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler) project and thing are starting to come together. I haveÂ changed it so that instead of one big solution I will have three smaller ones. This will allow me to cross reference the different services.

Essentially the Team Server fires events that a service (TFSEventQueuer) captures and adds them, with a little jiggery porkery, to a message queue. The second service (TFSEventHandlers) reads the Queue and executes the appropriate handlers.

This should be pretty neat once it is complete, and the interface should allow users to easily administer the handlers.

Still a long way to go... But I hope to have a working version by the end of the week...
