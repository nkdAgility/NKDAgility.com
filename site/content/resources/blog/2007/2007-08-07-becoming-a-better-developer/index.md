[Steve Clements](http://geekswithblogs.net/steveclements/archive/2007/07/26/114182.aspx "Becoming a better developer...") has tagged me (thanks Steve) about how to become a [better developer](http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx), he thinks tagging me 'would make an interesting read'..Hmm, no pressure:

- **Actually study for my** [**MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer**](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) **like I said I would.** I [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx) earlier in the year that I was going to study for my [MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx) and that I was going to start with [Exam 70–536](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp): TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation. Well I got 80% through the book, got board, and stopped... I even managed to get my company to buy me all of the books for the MCPD and they are just sitting on the shelve at home. I have tried to kid myself that the reason I failed was that the books are heavy, _well they are_, but that is no excuse, _well maybe not a good one_... So I resolve to pull my finger out and get reading...
- **Create a final version of my [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") Event Handler system.** If you read my blog, you will know that from time to time I work on a little project on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") called the [TFS Event Handler](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler). I have a working prototype up, but I need to get my finger out an finish it. I will need a more powerfully laptop though, which leads me onto...
- **Get a better laptop.** I have been humming and hawing about getting a new laptop, one that can run TFS in a VPC. The fact is, I have no room for a desktop in my house and a laptop powerful enough for my needs will be about £3000... Which I don't have...
- **Blog about "what have I done lately".** I recently [posted](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/04/Blogging-about.aspx "what I have done lately") about what I had been doing during the last couple of weeks as I though I had not been doing much. But once I started the post I found the list of things I had been looking at, working on and subjected to just kept getting bigger. I endeavor to keep up my weekly, or biweekly update if nothing else...
- **Explain [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") and its benefits to a developer to anyone who will listen.** I have started [blogging recently](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/23/What-is-dyslexiaAgain.aspx "What is dyslexia Again") about what it is like to be dyslexic and how it affects my work, both for the [positive](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/22/How-to-become-a-Multi-Dimensional-Free-Thinker.aspx) and the [negative](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/06/Why-I-think-VB.NET-is-a-better-choice-than-C.aspx). Doing this will hopefully encourage not just budding dyslexic programmer, but anyone in jobs that require problem solving, lateral thinking, or _architecture_. I may be going down to London to speak at a company conference to [Dyslexia](http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm "Multi-dimensional FreeThinking") on disability, so I think that would cover it...
- **Join a user group.** I am not sure if this would make me a better developer, but it should expose me to more developers at the same level as me. I have not met many developer who have the same avid interest in technology as me. Many developers seam to think that being a developer is _just_ a _**career**!_ Perish the thought, its more than a career, its an adventure...

Well I think that I am done...yes, I'm done...Now all that is left is to tag some people. I think I would tag Sandy Cormie and Ajay Patwari if they had blogs, but I will tag [Jason Franks](http://geekswithblogs.net/jasonfranks/archive/2007/08/12/Better.Dev.aspx) because he makes me laugh, [Mickey Gousset](http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/) because TFS is cool, and [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/) because he is an inspired speaker who can also write code...
