  - "<p><a title=\"Becoming a better developer...\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net/steveclements/archive/2007/07/26/114182.aspx\">Steve Clements</a> has tagged me (thanks Steve) about how to become a\_<a href=\"http://graysmatter.codivation.com/HowIAmBecomingABetterDeveloperPart1OfInfinity.aspx\">better developer</a>, he thinks tagging me 'would make an interesting read'..Hmm, no pressure:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Actually study for my </strong><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx\"><strong>MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer</strong></a><strong>\_like I said I would. </strong>I <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/05/04/Studying-for-Exam-70-536-MCTS-Application-Development-Foundation.aspx\">posted</a> earlier in the year that I was going to study for my <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/entapp/default.mspx\">MCPD: Enterprise Applications Developer</a>\_and that I was going to start with <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-536.asp\">Exam 70–536</a>: TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Application Development Foundation. Well I got 80% through the book, got board, and stopped... I even managed to get my company to buy me all of the books for the MCPD and they are just sitting on the shelve at home. I have tried to kid myself that the reason I failed was that the books are heavy, <em>well they are</em>, but that is no excuse, <em>well maybe not a good one</em>... So I resolve to pull my finger out and get reading... </li>\n    <li><strong>Create a final version of my <a title=\"Team Foundation Server\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx\">TFS</a> Event Handler system.</strong> If you read my blog, you will know that from time to time I work on a little project on <a title=\"CodePlex\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com\">CodePlex</a> called the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler\">TFS Event Handler</a>. I have a working prototype up, but I need to get my finger out an finish it. I will need a more powerfully laptop though, which leads me onto... </li>\n    <li><strong>Get a better laptop.</strong> I have been humming and hawing about getting a new laptop, one that can run TFS in a VPC. The fact is, I have no room for a desktop in my house and a laptop powerful enough for my needs will be about £3000... Which I don't have... </li>\n    <li><strong>Blog about \"what have I done lately\".</strong> I recently <a title=\"what I have done lately\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/04/Blogging-about.aspx\">posted</a> about what I had been\_doing during the last couple of\_weeks\_as I though I had not\_been doing\_much. But once I started the post I found the list of\_things I had been looking at, working on and subjected to just kept getting bigger. I endeavor to keep up my weekly, or biweekly update if nothing else... </li>\n    <li><strong>Explain <a title=\"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm\">Dyslexia</a> and its benefits to a developer to anyone who will listen.</strong> I have started <a title=\"What is dyslexia Again\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/23/What-is-dyslexiaAgain.aspx\">blogging recently</a> about what it is like to be dyslexic and how it affects my work, both for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/22/How-to-become-a-Multi-Dimensional-Free-Thinker.aspx\">positive</a> and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/08/06/Why-I-think-VB.NET-is-a-better-choice-than-C.aspx\">negative</a>. Doing this will hopefully encourage not just budding dyslexic programmer, but anyone in jobs that require problem solving, lateral thinking, or <em>architecture</em>. I may be going down to London to speak at a company conference to <a title=\"Multi-dimensional FreeThinking\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.dyslexia.tv/freethinkersu/dyslexic_dictionary.htm\">Dyslexia</a> on disability, so I think that would cover it... </li>\n    <li><strong>Join a user group.</strong> I am not sure if this would make me a better developer, but it should expose me to more developers at the same level as me. I have not met many developer who have the same avid interest in technology as me. Many developers seam to think that being a developer is <em>just</em> a <em><strong>career</strong>!</em> Perish the thought, its more than a career, its an adventure... </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well I think that I am done...yes, I'm done...Now all that is left is to tag some people. I think I would tag Sandy Cormie and Ajay Patwari if they had blogs, but I will tag <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net/jasonfranks/archive/2007/08/12/Better.Dev.aspx\">Jason Franks</a>\_because he makes me laugh, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://teamsystemrocks.com/blogs/mickey_gousset/\">Mickey Gousset</a>\_because TFS is cool, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/\">Mike Taulty</a> because he is an inspired speaker who can also write code...</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Dyslexia\" rel=\"tag\">Dyslexia</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/.NET\" rel=\"tag\">.NET</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      Martin - these are all awesome goals and I hope you achieve them!!  You
      are actually the first dyslexic programmer I have ever heard of - I for
      one would definitely love to hear more about the advantages and
      disadvantages of it as regards coding.

      Hi Justice gray,<br /><br />  Although I may be the first Programmer you
      have heard of that is dyslexic, with a minimum of 15% of the population of
      the world being dyslexic and with the advantages the differences in the
      way dyslexics thought process work, I think that many programmers will be
      dyslexic and not know it! I was lucky and was caught early (8 years old)
      so I received the early form of extra education to compensate. <br /><br
