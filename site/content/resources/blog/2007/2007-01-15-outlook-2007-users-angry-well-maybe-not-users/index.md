I am a little confused by all the hullabaloo over the Outlook email changes [Mary Jo Foley](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/ "Mary Jo Foley") recently blogged in her article [Outlook 2007 users angry over Office 2007 HTML-e-mail changes](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/wp-trackback.php?p=200 "Permalink") about some of the changes. I think that this change is a good thing. It moves away from emails being HTML and more towards them as documents. This is the way that most users use email, as documents and it would be much better to have email files as Open XML, there by allowing searching and indexing of the emails in a much easier way.

This is a move forward in email, not backward. It may be a move backward for the design of marketing emails, but who cares, not the users. IT is an ever changing field, if you can't embrace that then you really should not be in IT.

It is not the users that are angry. Why would they be, this does not significantly affect them. It is the developers and designers that are angry, get with the program...

Are there any USERS out there that are angry? I think not...
