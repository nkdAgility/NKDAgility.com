If you are trying to get windows mobile device center running on Vista 6000 RTM then you will need to install the beta as it is not actively released.

Update 2006-12-20

Although [Daniel Moth](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog)Â made a comment about doing a windows update while the phone is connected, this did not work. As the "Windows Mobile Device Center" is not out of beta, you need to download it manually.
