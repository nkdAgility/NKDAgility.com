    <p>As part of the Scrum.org webinar “Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer -
    Martin Hinshelwood - Answering Your Most Pressing Scrum Questions” I was
    asked a number of questions. Since not only was I on the spot and live, I
    thought that I should answer each question that was asked again here, as
    well as those questions I did not get to.</p><p>In case you missed it, here
    is the recording of yesterday's Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer webinar
    with Martin Hinshelwood! Watch here: <a
    href="http://ow.ly/ijiM50vwEkD">http://ow.ly/ijiM50vwEkD</a><h3>[Question]
    Should the Scrum Master always remove impediments?</h3></p><p>Yes, the Scrum
    Master should always remove Impediments. That is their responsibility on the
    Scrum Team. However, what is an impediment?<blockquote><p>An Impediment is
    something that impedes [slows] a Teams progress, and that they are unable to
    deal with themselves.</p></blockquote></p><p>Both parts of this are
    critical. Often the Scrum Master will head off on a mission to solve an
    impediment that is not really an impediment. They need to stop and ask
    themselves: </p><p><br /><ul><li><strong>Is this something the Scrum Team
    <em>can</em> solve on their own?</strong><br /><br />If so, do nothing, and
    only help the Team resolve it. Hopefully over time the Team will learn to
    resolve this issue without having to raise it to the Scrum Master at all.<br
    /><br /></li><li><strong>Is this something that the Scrum Team
    <em>should</em> be able to solve on their own?</strong><br /><br />If this
    is the case then the Scrum Masters focus should be on helping the Team learn
    a new skill or build a new relationship that will allow them to solve this
    on their own. The Scrum Master is not a problem solver, and refraining from
    solving problems is one of the most powerful tool in their adrenal. <br
    /><br /></li></ul></p><p>If after both of these questions have been fully
    explored the item still looks like an Impediment then the Scrum Master
    should work to resolve it, all the while thinking about what they could do
    to enable the Team to be able to solve them on their own. The future of the
    Scrum Master is to make the Scrum Team as self-sufficient as posible, within
    the bounds of their organisation, so that they can go tackle some of those
    organisational impediments that are preventing even more
    maturity.</p><p>While there are no right answers there are some answers that
    are better than others. For your given situation select the most right
    answer, and iteration to the best version of it.</p>
