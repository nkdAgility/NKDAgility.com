    <p>In the empirical world, we have 3 key skill areas of accountability that
    are needed to effectively deliver products of the highest possible value! We
    need Influencers that can provide leadership and create environments within
    which groups of people can organise the work. I consider this the Leadership
    Track where you have Scrum Masters, Coaches, and CEO. We need Entrepreneurs
    who can have a vision and project knowledge and understanding of that vision
    to the people that need to make that vision happen. This is the Value Track
    and may be made up of Product Owners, Analysts, and Subject Matter Experts.
    Last we have the Makers who are the ones who do the work that brings the
    product to life. They are on the Technical Track and focus on turning the
    vision into a reality. They have many skills and may have coders, testers,
    and other experts...</p>

    <p>To have a successful company we need all three tracks to exist in the
    correct balance!</p>

    <p>Ultimately what do you care about? Do you care about the people, the
    product, or the work? You have lots of choices here, and you can always
    cross between these tracks, however, there should be progression and growth
    in each of them. You should not have to change track to grow.</p>
