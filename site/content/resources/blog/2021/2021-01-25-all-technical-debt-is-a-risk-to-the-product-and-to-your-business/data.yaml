    <p>If you were buying a car, or a TV, you as the purchaser would do your
    best to understand the product that you are buying, the quality tradeoffs,
    and the capabilities. </p>

    <p>So why is so much of software opaque to the business? Why does the
    business have a fire-and-forget mentality and little interest in
    understanding what they are investing in? </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>The modern businesses negligence in understanding their capital
    investment is in that lack of understanding. You can't hide it in a cost
    centre forever.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Every business (receiving entity) requesting a custom solution should
    expect valuable delivery of the highest possible quality. Your delivery
    should valuable and work; be free from known defect. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><em><strong>All technical debt is risk to the product and to your
    business. </strong></em></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Technical debt is like an unhedged fund! There is no asset securing that
    risk, no insurance for it. Technical debt is 100% risk.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Since Product Delivery is a capital expenditure the output is an asset of
    your organisation in the same way that a building or equipment is. All of
    these assets should be accurately represented on a balance sheet and likely
    part of your year-end accounts. Part of the worth of your company.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>There is a name given to miss representing an organisational
    asset, either knowingly or unknowingly, on your corporate accents:
    fraud.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="h-but-not-all-debt-is-bad">"But, not all debt is bad!"</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>I hear the phrase "but not all debt is bad" a lot, usually coupled with
    "some level of debt is manageable" and, as a software developer, it makes me
    cringe. There is no acceptable level of technical debt.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Poorly written or difficult to understand</strong> - if it takes
    new people weeks to become productive then you likely have a product that is
    difficult to read, difficult to change, and prone to error.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Changing things results in faults</strong> - any time your team
    turns into a bunch of Plumber's sucking air when you suggest a change you
    know that part of the system has way too much technical debt.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Lack of Automation</strong> - Anything that can be automated
    should be, anything that cant should be rearchitected so that it can
    be.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>It's important to understand that technical debt does not accumulate
    linearly. It can take years for the debt to accumulate, and years for it to
    become a serious problem. It sneaks up on you, and suddenly you are lying
    bloody on the floor wondering where your wallet is.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>A good example of this is from the Developer Division (DivDev) at
    Microsoft in developing a product called Team Foundation Server. This
    commercial product was built using traditional project management practices
    and delivered on a two-yearly cadence. From 2005 (first beta) until 2012
    they worked, successfully delivering a new version every 2 years. Even
    before 2012 Leadership, and engineers, had noticed that things were getting
    bogged down. Things were just taking longer to deliver than before and by
    2012, with circa 600 people working on it, they were delivering just over 24
    features to production each year.</p>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The gap between their features and competitors was growing, and customer
    expectations were only able to be met by sacrificing yet more quality for
    speed. On a two-yearly cadence, it takes four years to deliver on feature
    requests.</p>

    <p>Technical debt had become a serious business problem!</p>

    debt</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Two visionaries at Microsoft, Brian Harry and Aaron Bjork, started to
    make changes to tackle this problem. They saw that they needed to get closer
    to the customers need. To do this they had to shorten the feedback loop, and
    they settled on 3-week Sprints using Scrum.</p>

    Sprints instead!</figcaption></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>And boy was that hard! Moving to 3-week Sprints created a level of
    transparency that instilled fear! Fear of failure, fear of being an
    imposter, fear of being held accountable. Aaron and Brian worked hard to
    push forward and alleviate those fears so that they could really see what
    was going on and create an environment where the product delivery teams
    could do their best work.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>It took them many years of hard work paying back the now transparent
    Technical Debt to get to where they are now. They have decoupled delivery
    and release, and while they still have a 3-week release cadence most of the
    work is done within continuous delivery. Feedback from customers can be
    implemented and delivered within hours or days, not months and years.</p>

    <p>This became a game-changer for the whole group and ultimately was rolled
    out throughout Microsoft changing the company from a large oil tanker to a
    flotilla of patrol boats looking for opportunities to provide value.</p>

    <h2 id="h-technical-debt-will-always-bite-back">Technical Debt will always
    bite back</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>It’s the compound nature of the debt, its ninja-like hiding ability, and
    deceptive payback cost that is the risk. You have no idea how deep the
    rabbit hole goes.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>It's like a sub-prime Mortgage pack: We are making a lot of money
    now by steaming ahead and running that tightrope of debt vs delivery, but at
    some point, we are just screwed!</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>I just don’t believe that if the business (read CFO) of the receiving
    entity really understood the risk that technical debt creates that they
    would ever approve of any level of acceptable debt.  If you don't create a
    culture of quality then we:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Are not really sure what is done and what is not</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Have no idea what we can do and when it will be done</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Have no idea what even needs to be done</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>It’s a Roadkill Burger! It may indeed be tasty at the moment, but
    you will eventually get sick and die.</strong></p>
