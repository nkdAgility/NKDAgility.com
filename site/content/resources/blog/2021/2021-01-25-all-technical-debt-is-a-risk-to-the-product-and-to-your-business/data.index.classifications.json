While it briefly mentions a transition to using 3-week sprints with Scrum as an attempt to manage this debt, the overall discussion lacks a comprehensive exploration of frameworks, implementation strategies, or best practices, which are central to the 'Framework' category. Thus, it only touches on the category without substantive depth, leading to a low confidence score.",
