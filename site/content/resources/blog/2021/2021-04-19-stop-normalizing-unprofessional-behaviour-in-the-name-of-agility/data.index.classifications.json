    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses the importance of professionalism and ethical behavior in Scrum, which indirectly relates to capability by arguing that professionalism is necessary for agile practices to function effectively. However, it does not provide a thorough exploration of capabilities or strategies for developing them, and much of the focus is on criticizing unprofessional behavior rather than outlining enduring competencies. The discussion is more centered around the implications of behavior in the context of agile rather than on building organizational capabilities.",
