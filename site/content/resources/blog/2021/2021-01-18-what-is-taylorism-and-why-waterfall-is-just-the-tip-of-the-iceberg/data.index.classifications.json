While it discusses the negative impacts of hierarchical structures and advocates for a more human-centric approach, it does not explicitly mention Beta Codex or its principles. The focus is primarily on the failures of traditional methods rather than on the adaptive, decentralised frameworks that Beta Codex promotes. Therefore, while there is some alignment with the themes of decentralisation and human-centric approaches, the lack of direct discussion on Beta Codex principles and the depth of exploration into alternative frameworks limits the confidence score.",
