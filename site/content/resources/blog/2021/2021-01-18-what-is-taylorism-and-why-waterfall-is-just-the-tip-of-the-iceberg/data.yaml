    <p>For many people the traditional project management methodologies (see PMI
    / PRINCE2) are the root of the problems that birthed Waterfall. I assert
    that this is the tip of the iceberg. These methodologies are just a symptom
    of a greater problem that has its roots in the changes made during the
    industrial revolution. These changes, while they generated great amounts of
    wealth and many jobs around the world,&nbsp; dehumanised work and destroyed
    the essence of value and discovery that brought humanity to where it is now.
    It created processes that turned people into little more than sophisticated
    robots and enshrined that thinking into the very core of how we do
    things.</p>

    <p><strong>These practices, which spread like cancer,  have been seeded
    around the world by the Master of Business Administration (MBA). These
    practices have been calcified in the malignant bureaucracy that can be
    likened to an iceberg that may very well sink your company.</strong></p>

    <p>Prior to the industrial revolution, goods were made in small cottage
    industries and people worked close to their home. Customers were local, and
    both the producer and the consumer knew each other well. Mastery in ones
    chosen profession was paramount and rewards for the master craftsman were
    earned through increased money, or more time to pursue other interests.</p>

    <p>When the industrial revolution came along, massive mechanisation was
    needed to produce goods at scale. However the technology of the time was
    unable to automate at that scale, so the only available "machines" were
    people. When, in pursuit of higher production volumes, you take away from
    people their autonomy, mastery, and purpose in your pursuit, you take away
    their soul. When you take away the essential elements of rewarding work,
    people become mindless automatons.</p>

    <p>Frederick Winslow Taylor is a controversial figure in management history.
    His innovations in industrial engineering, particularly in time and motion
    studies, paid off in dramatic improvements in productivity. At the same
    time, he has been credited with destroying the soul of work, of dehumanizing
    factories, making men into automatons.</p>

    <p>Traditional management practices were born out of the disengagement of
    the workforce. With the outcome controlled and repeatable, management
    focuses on best practices and incentivising people to work faster and
    harder. They wanted to remove thinking from the work since thinking creates
    ideas, and ideas create deviations from the pre-defigned optimal way of
    working.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>The thinking goes like this: Ideas and innovation from your
    workers were a risk to your business and thus must be eliminated. We need to
    remove thinking!</strong></p>

    <p>When you remove thinking from work and turn people into automatons:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>People don't care about the work -</strong> and your workforce
    disengages, so their interest in the work and empathy for the customer also
    wains. Your workforce doesn't care about the work, and workers primary
    concern is no longer the success of the company. They are instead concerned
    mainly with the output of their repetitive operation and maintaining or
    increasing their levels of remuneration.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>People become replaceable cogs -</strong> Indeed the company
    comes to see an uneducated workforce who just do as they are told as easily
    replaceable resources. They don't have any discernable skills and the
    company has many people waiting for those jobs that can be easily slotted
    in. The company now no longer cares about the individual and they become
    resources to be allocated and replaced. </li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>These two outcomes result in an erosion of trust between the workers and
    the company.</p>

    <p>These working practices have resulted in:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Put people in competency-based groups</strong> - this has not
    only resulted in isolated silos but also hierarchies within
    organisations.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Create standard practices</strong> - The idea that Best
    Practices can be created and the best outcomes will result from the use of
    these practices.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Reduced wage based on expected low performance and bonuses
    offered for increased output</strong> - in the output-driven world, we need
    our employees to be competing for the jobs so that they toe the line or lose
    their jobs and the benefits that come with them.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>This was the advent of the age of bureaucracy</strong>.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>If you think about the school system in most countries, especially if you
    are over 30; we all sat in rows, did the same thing at the same time, were
    forbidden from talking, and teachers used incentive based learning! I 
    assert that there is no difference between this and the treatment of factory
    workers. <strong><em>The modern school system was developed during the
    industrial revolution to train factory workers.</em></strong></p>

    <p>The end result is that many people have been trained from an early age to
    be factory workers. However very few of us will end up as factory workers
    today. We will more likely be office workers, solving cognitive business
    problems.</p>

    <h3>The trouble with departments &amp; hierarchies</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived as
    untrustworthy.  Managers were needed to tell workers what to do and how to
    do it. As our organisations grew we needed managers to manage the growing
    number of managers and incentivise those managers to increase productivity
    in our employees through any means that they could.</p>

    Method</cite></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Using the Scientific Management Method the Business Owners should
    identify each problem domain (e.g. Sales, HR, Marketing, Engineering,
    Testing) and come up with the "one true way" to do that work within the
    domain. The Business Owners can then hire managers and workers that will be
    trained in the "one true way" of doing that work, and minimise deviation
    from the Business Owners control.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>And so we created departments so we could centralise training and
    knowledge on a single topic. If you were hired for sales, you ended up in
    the sales department: Completely disconnected from the makers, the
    designers, and the implementers.  There would be no need for communications
    between Sales and the other departments since we have planned all of their
    work methods and need only follow the script.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>As the world became more complex and sales became a creative endeavour
    the imposed departmental isolation model became a negative impact. Sales
    personnel started making decisions in the complex world only taking sales
    concerns into account; that, by design, was all they knew. Creation and
    delivery had no bearing on closing deals, so they were ignored except in the
    most general terms. To close the deal and get ones bonus sales personnel
    only needed to get the customer to sign, it mattered not if you could
    actually deliver.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>Often the result of this relationship was animosity between the
    departments, and unhappy customers when either quality, money, time, or
    features had to suffer.</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>An example of this was the Microsoft Azure Platform. Salespeople were
    measures and bonuses paid based on the amount of Azure that customers
    bought. This measure resulted in salespeople pushing output over the
    outcome. They sold millions of dollars of Azure to companies that never used
    it. This resulted in unhappy customers and declining sales. Customer failed
    to see the value in what they were buying.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Then Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) changed the measure for Sales from
    the output based measure to one based on the customer's outcome. Salespeople
    were no longer bonused based on how much they sold, but instead on how much
    a customer used. This change was revolutionary for sales of Azure. They were
    no longer focused on the short term ( to get executives to sign) but on a
    much longer engagement model with customers. It became critical to encourage
    customers, with direct help, to move towards DevOps practices. Microsoft
    provided ( and continued to provide) consultants and coaches to help create
    better outcomes for customers. This has paid off hugely for Microsoft as
    they are now the largest cloud computing provider despite starting late.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>This seemingly small change in how people are measured changed behaviours
    greatly. Many salespeople left Microsoft as a direct result as they were
    only interested in the short term, and not the long term investment in
    customer success.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Microsoft also restructured how Sales personnel work so rather than it
    being one huge department each product was responsible for their own Sales,
    Marketing, Engineering, and Support. With Sales now a skill within the
    Product teams instead of a separate organisation, Product Groups can
    leverage the combined knowledge of all disciplines to encourage customers to
    use more azure.</p>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived as
    unskilled.  Business owners needed to create standard operating procedures
    for every facet of work within each problem domain. The work of the time
    existed within the simple space. The work being performed may by categorised
    as "simple", with relatively few unknowns. Manufacturing created a large
    volume of pre-defined work in a low variance environment where the outcomes
    of the work were known before the work was performed. Output was the only
    control and correlated directly to profitability.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Since there was a low variability in the work we could plan it all out
    beforehand, and simply follow that plan. We could hire managers to maintain
    order and compliance with defined methods, and treat employees as simple
    replicable cogs.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>Business owners created <em>best practices</em> for creating

    <p>As the world became more complicated and we were able to create
    automation using machinery with software to control it. The simple, low
    variance work could be automated. This allowed workers to focus on more
    complex cognitive tasks, but the management practices more suited to
    repetitive, low-variance work persisted.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Although the work had changed, the belief in predictive planning

    <p><strong>Best Practices, Centers of Excellence, and Innovation Labs are

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Even in the simple, low-variance domain, the old Tayloristic practices
    based on the Scientific Management Method destroy the soul of work. These
    practices create workers that hate the work, their managers, and the
    company.  </p>

    <p><strong>We need a new way!</strong></p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In the simple world, the Toyota Production System is the poster child of
    innovation and discovering new ways of working. Optimizing the workspace and
    creating good practices became the job of the employee and they were
    encouraged to periodically stop and reflect on how to do things better. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In the complex world of Sales, Marketing, and Software Development we
    also needed new ways of thinking that would power the same ideas from Toyota
    and Lean into the high variance world of complex cognitive work. This was
    the birth of the Agile movement with the Scrum Framework (1993), the Agile
    Manifesto (2001), and later Kanban (2004). </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Instead of coming up with best practices, we realise that there are only
    good practices for the situation at hand. A good practice, today might not
    be quite so good tomorrow, and thus we need to be a lot more flexible. No
    longer is the business owner (or manager) the best person to define these
    practices since they are no longer close to the problem.</p>

    the people doing the work: they have the information required to make better
    decisions about which actions are more likely to yield the desired
    outcomes.</p>

    Bonus systems</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>In the days of the industrial revolution, employees were perceived to be
    lazy.  It was perceived that revenue was lost due to this lazy, malingering
    workforce and so business owners needed to figure out how to minimise
    downtime and maximize output. Since managers were keeping people with the
    same ability in the same group, and planning everyone's work, the one
    remaining thing to be controlled was the worker's focus. </p>

    <p>"Reduced wage based on expected low performance and bonuses for increased
    output"</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph --><cite>The Scientific Management
    Method</cite></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Managers used various methods to incentivise workers to work harder and
    faster:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Taylor Differential&nbsp;Piece Work&nbsp;System</strong> -
    &nbsp;This system provides for higher rewards to more efficient workers. For
    different levels of output below and above the standard, different piece
    rates are applicable.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Gantt task and bonus system</strong> - the system consists of
    paying a worker on a time basis if he does not attain the standard and on
    piece basis (high rate) if he does.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Emerson’s efficiency system</strong> - Under this system minimum
    time wages are guaranteed, but beyond a certain efficiency level, a bonus in
    addition to minimum day wages is given</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The Task and Bonus system is by far the most prevailing practice today, 
    however, all of these systems were designed to create the same outcome and
    have a similar negative impact on workers. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Developed by Henry Gantt, the Task and Bonus system is an augmentation to
    the Taylor Differential piece work system and was intended to pay workers a
    low wage, since we expect them to have low performance, and then have a
    bonus that takes them to a potential high wage. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>Taylor, Gantt, and Emerson all created different "Carrot and the
    Stick" approaches to management.</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>There are other ways to try and incentivise people, rather than just how
    they are remunerated:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Employee Of the Month</strong> - The&nbsp;Employee of the
    Month&nbsp;(EOM) is a type of reward program given out by companies (often
    to encourage the staff to work harder and more productively).&nbsp;</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong> - A&nbsp;performance appraisal,
    also referred to as a&nbsp;performance review,&nbsp;performance
    evaluation,&nbsp;(career) development discussion,&nbsp;or&nbsp;employee
    appraisal&nbsp;is a method by which the job performance of
    an&nbsp;employee&nbsp;is documented and evaluated. Performance appraisals
    are a part of&nbsp;career development&nbsp;and consist of regular reviews of
    employee performance within&nbsp;organizations.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Hierarchy Progression</strong> - The idea that job title in some
    way related to reward, success or expertise. </li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The idea that you need to dangle a carrot in front of the employees in
    order to get them to work more efficiently is a logical outcome of the
    practices we have been discussing throughout this article.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>There have been many studies done at universities around the world on
    financial incentives for employees. All of them agree that higher pay and
    bonuses only resulted in better performance when the tasks were basic
    mechanical tasks. More money works for tasks that have a pre-defined set of
    steps with a single answer.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p> If a task involved even a small amount of cognitive skills, decisions
    making, or creativity then more money resulted in <strong><em>lower
    </em></strong>performance. This is contrary to the common understanding of
    wage incentives.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>If you are managing people you should pay them enough so that they feel
    that they are compensated fairly and not struggling to meet their basic
    needs. You should pay them enough to take the issue of money off the
    table.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>There are three key areas that Leaders need to focus on that will
    increase the performance of your workforce:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Autonomy</strong> — Employees desire to be self-directed.
    Autonomy increases engagement.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Mastery</strong> — The urge to get better at a skill, craft, or
    discipline.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li><strong>Purpose</strong> — The desire to do something that has meaning
    and is important. </li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->

    <p>If you and your business only focus on profits without valuing your
    employees need for autonomy, mastery, and purpose then you may end up with
    unhappy employees and poor customer service. I don't know about you, but I
    do not do my best work when I am unhappy!</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>These Tayloristic practices worked well for employers during the
    industrial revolution. However, even factory work has progressed in the
    shadow of the Toyota Production System and the lean movement.  People are no
    longer cogs in a machine that can be replaced at a moments notice. Each
    employee brings a unique skill or ability to your product discovery and
    product development story.  That story will be unique because of it. These
    Tayloristic practices kill ingenuity, focus, and enthusiasm.</p>

      For many people the traditional project management methodologies (see PMI
      / PRINCE2) are the root of the problems that birthed Waterfall. I assert
      that this is the tip of the iceberg.
