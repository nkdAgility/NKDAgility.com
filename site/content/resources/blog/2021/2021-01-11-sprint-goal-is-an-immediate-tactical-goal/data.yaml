    <p>In the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-evidence-based-management-guide-measuring-value-to-enable-improvement-and-agility/">The
    Evidence-Based Management Guide</a> we talk about the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/product-goal-is-an-intermediate-strategic-goal/">Intermediate
    Strategic Goal</a> and I likened that to the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a> in the <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide">2020
    Scrum Guide</a>. If we also think of each Sprint as a tactical move towards
    fulfilling that <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a> then the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint
    Goal</a> becomes an Intermediate Tactical Goal that moves us towards our
    current Intermediate Strategic Goal.</p>

    <p>The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint
    Goal is a Commitment for the Sprint Backlog</a> and should never be
    "complete those 10 things" but instead should to describe the Why of the
    Sprint. </p>

    <p>Just as the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-product-goal">Product
    Goal</a> provides the current Strategic direction so the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint
    Goal</a> is the smaller step, the implementation step towards it. The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a> is accountable for maximizing the value delivered and should be
    thinking hard, with the help of the Developers, on what the next tactical
    outcome they want to try and achieve is.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint
    Goal</a> should be high level and I would recommend that using a Lean Canvas
    to help identify not only the business objective but the behaviour that the
    <a href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a> is trying to create in users or other systems. While I favour the
    Lean UX Canvas, which we teach in the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-training/">Professional
    Scrum with UX</a>, there are many valid options out there to use as a
    complementary practice in this space.</p>

    <p>At a minimum, I would expect a <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a> to have a hypothesis. A hypothesis is like an assumption, but also
    with a measure/metric that tells you if you have validated that assumption.
    </p>

    <p><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owners</a> are accountable for maximising value and should be looking to not
    just build features that customers need now, but predict or drive which
    features that they need now. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3
    id="h-a-good-product-owner-will-build-features-now-that-your-customers-need-now">A
    good Product Owner will build features now that your customers need
    now.</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We should always be working to engage with our users; users don't engage
    when you build a feature that they will need in 6 months. Instead, we should
    focus on what will solve an immediate business problem for our users. This
    will engage them in the process and elicit much more excellent feedback from
    them. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3
    id="h-a-great-product-owner-will-anticipate-the-features-that-customers-need-now">A
    great Product Owner will anticipate the features that customers need
    now.</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The trick for any <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a> is to figure out where the market is going and build features that
    drive it, rather than just following it. Having a vision and
    entrepreneurially iterating towards that vision empirically with many small
    hypotheses is key to unlocking this level up of Product Ownership.</p>
