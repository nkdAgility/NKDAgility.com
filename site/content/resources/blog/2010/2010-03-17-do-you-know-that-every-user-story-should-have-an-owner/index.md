Update 14th April 2010

- Rule added to [Rules to better Scrum with TFS](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/)

They will collect all of the [“Done” emails](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterEmail.aspx#ReplyAndDelete) and make sure that everyone follows the Done criteria identified by the team as well as answering any Product Owner queries.

**Figure: Good example, the product owner can now see who he should speak to and developers know where to send done emails.**
