This ultimately leads to messy code as things are added and never finished. Your only alternative is to NEVER check in unless your code is 100%, but this does not work in practice, even with a single developer. Your ADD will kick in and your half-finished code will be finished enough to pass the build and the tests. You do <a title=\"Do you know the minimum builds to create on any branch?\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/03/18/do-you-know-the-minimum-builds-to-create-on-any.aspx\">use builds</a> don’t you?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Sadly, this is a very common scenario and I have had people argue that branching merely adds complexity. Then again I have seen the other side of the universe ... branching\_ structures from he... We should somehow convince everyone that there is a happy between no-branching and too-much-branching. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/\"><strong>Willy-Peter Schaub</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\_</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>A key benefit of branching for development is to isolate changes from the stable Main branch. Branching adds sanity more than it adds complexity. We do try to stress in our guidance that it is important to justify a branch, by doing a cost benefit analysis. The primary cost is the effort to do merges and resolve conflicts. A key benefit is that you have a stable code base in Main and accept changes into Main only after they pass quality gates, etc. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/billheys/\"><strong>Bill Heys</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger &amp; TFS Branching Lead, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>second biggest mistake</strong> developers make is branching anything other than the WHOLE “Main” line. If you branch parts of your code and not others it gets out of sync and can make integration a nightmare. You should have your Source, Assets, Build scripts deployment scripts and dependencies inside the “Main” folder and branch the whole thing. Some departments within MSFT even go as far as to add the environments used to develop the product in there as well; although I would not recommend that unless you have a massive SQL cluster to house your source code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>We tried the “add environment” back in South-Africa and while it was “phenomenal”, especially when having to switch between environments, the disk storage and processing requirements killed us. We opted for virtualization to skin this cat of keeping a ready-to-go environment handy. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/\"><strong>Willy-Peter Schaub</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\_</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>I think people often think that you should have separate branches for separate environments (e.g. Dev, Test, Integration Test, QA, etc.). I prefer to think of deploying to environments (such as from Main to QA) rather than branching for QA). <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/billheys/\"><strong>Bill Heys</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger &amp; TFS Branching Lead, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>You can read about SSW’s <a title=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSourceControlwithTFS.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulesToBetterSourceControlwithTFS.aspx\">Rules to better Source Control</a> for some additional information on what Source Control to use and how to use it.</p>\n<p>There are also a number of branching Anti-Patterns that should be avoided at all costs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You know you are on the wrong track if you experience one or more of the following symptoms in your development environment:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Merge Paranoia</b>—avoiding merging at all cost, usually because of a fear of the consequences.</li>\n    <li><b>Merge Mania</b>—spending too much time merging software assets instead of developing them.</li>\n    <li><b>Big Bang Merge</b>—deferring branch merging to the end of the development effort and attempting to merge all branches simultaneously.</li>\n    <li><b>Never-Ending Merge</b>—continuous merging activity because there is always more to merge.</li>\n    <li><b>Wrong-Way Merge</b>—merging a software asset version with an earlier version.</li>\n    <li><b>Branch Mania</b>—creating many branches for no apparent reason.</li>\n    <li><b>Cascading Branches</b>—branching but never merging back to the main line.</li>\n    <li><b>Mysterious Branches</b>—branching for no apparent reason.</li>\n    <li><b>Temporary Branches</b>—branching for changing reasons, so the branch becomes a permanent temporary workspace.</li>\n    <li><b>Volatile Branches</b>—branching with unstable software assets shared by other branches or merged into another branch. <br />\n    <b>Note</b>\_\_ Branches are volatile most of the time while they exist as independent branches.

If you create merge conflicts, you will eventually need to resolve them. Often the resolution is manual. Merging more frequently allows you to resolve these conflicts close to when they happen, making the resolution clearer. Waiting weeks or months to resolve them, the Big Bang approach, means you are more likely to resolve conflicts incorrectly. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/billheys/\"><strong>Bill Heys</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger &amp; TFS Branching Lead, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_38.png\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"600\" height=\"90\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_thumb_18.png\" /></a> <br />\n<strong>Figure: Main line, this is where your stable code lives<em> </em>and where any build has known entities, always passes and has a happy test that passes as well?</strong></p>\n<p>Many development projects consist of, a single “Main” line of source and artifacts.

There are however a couple of issues that need to be considered.</p>\n<p>What happens if:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>you and your team are working on a new set of features and the customer wants a change to his current version?</li>\n    <li>you are working on two features and the customer decides to abandon one of them?</li>\n    <li>you have two teams working on different feature sets and their changes start interfering with each other?</li>\n    <li>I just use labels instead of branches?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's a lot of “what if’s”, but there is a simple way of preventing this. Branching…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>In TFS, labels are not immutable. This does not mean they are not useful. But labels do not provide a very good development isolation mechanism. Branching allows separate code sets to evolve separately (e.g. Current with hotfixes, and vNext with new development).

It consists of a single Sprint branch to contain all the changes for the current sprint. The main branch has the permissions changes so contributors to the project can only Branch and Merge with “Main”. This will prevent accidental check-ins or checkouts of the “Main” line that would contaminate the code. The developers continue to develop on sprint one until the completion of the sprint.</p>\n<p>Note: In the real world, starting a new Greenfield project, this process starts at Sprint 2 as at the start of Sprint 1 you would not have artifacts in version control and no need for isolation.</p>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"630\" height=\"207\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_4fa3f316-a790-46ce-88ee-c94395214208.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: Once the sprint is complete the Sprint 1 code can then be merged back into the Main line.</strong></p>\n<p>There are always good practices to follow, and one is to always do a Forward Integration from Main into Sprint 1 before you do a Reverse Integration from Sprint 1 back into Main. In this case it may seem superfluous, but this builds good muscle memory into your developer’s work ethic and means that no bad habits are learned that would interfere with additional Scrum Teams being added to the Product.</p>\n<p>The process of completing your sprint development:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>The Team completes their work according to their definition of done.</li>\n    <li>Merge from “Main” into “Sprint1” (Forward Integration)</li>\n    <li>Stabilize your code with any changes coming from other Scrum Teams working on the same product.

The goal in Scrum is to have a “potentially shippable product” at the end of every Sprint, and we do not have that yet, we only have finished code.</p>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"317\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_a31fb654-2e05-44e1-b5cf-aab22942ed2b.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: With Sprint 1 merged you can create a Release branch and run your final packaging and testing</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>In 99% of all projects I have been involved in or watched, a “shippable product” only happens towards the end of the overall lifecycle, especially when sprints are short. The in-between releases are great demonstration releases, but not shippable. Perhaps it comes from my 80’s brain washing that we only ship when we reach the agreed quality and business feature bar. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/\"><strong>Willy-Peter Schaub</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although you should have been testing and packaging your code all the way through your Sprint 1 development, preferably using an automated process, you still need to test and package with stable unchanging code. This is where you do what at SSW we call a “Test Please”. This is first an internal test of the product to make sure it meets the needs of the customer and you generally use a resource external to your Team. Then a “Test Please” is conducted with the Product Owner to make sure he is happy with the output.</p>\n<p>You can read about how to conduct a Test Please on our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.aspx\">Rules to Successful Projects</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a title=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.aspx#TestPlease\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Standards/Rules/RulestoSuccessfulProjects.aspx#TestPlease\">Do you conduct an internal \"test please\" prior to releasing a version to a client?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"311\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_7fac377a-1c04-4e7d-8442-e9de2c706554.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: If you find a deviation from the expected result you fix it on the Release branch. </strong></p>\n<p>If during your final testing or your “Test Please” you find there are issues or bugs then you should fix them on the release branch. If you can’t fix them within the time box of your Sprint, then you will need to create a Bug and put it onto the backlog for prioritization by the Product owner. Make sure you leave plenty of time between your merge from the development branch to find and fix any problems that are uncovered.</p>\n<p>This process is commonly called Stabilization and should always be conducted once you have completed all of your User Stories and integrated all of your branches. Even once you have stabilized and released, you should not delete the release branch as you would with the Sprint branch. It has a usefulness for servicing that may extend well beyond the limited life you expect of it.</p>\n<p>Note: Don't get forced by the business into adding features into a Release branch instead that indicates the unspoken requirement is that they are asking for a product spin-off. In this case you can create a new Team Project and branch from the required Release branch to create a new Main branch for that product. And you create a whole new backlog to work from.</p>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"434\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_eb80c89e-3732-4b46-a224-0daf57bdd6f9.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: When the Team decides it is happy with the product you can create a RTM branch.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have fixed all the bugs you can, and added any you can’t to the Product Backlog, and you Team is happy with the result you can create a Release. This would consist of doing the final Build and Packaging it up ready for your Sprint Review meeting.</p>\n<p>You would then create a read-only branch that represents the code you “shipped”, commonly referred to as RTM(Released to Market). This is really an Audit trail branch that is optional, but is good practice.This is really an Audit trail branch that is optional, but is good practice.</p>\n<p>You could use a Label, but Labels are not Auditable and if a dispute was raised by the customer you can produce a verifiable version of the source code for an independent party to check. Rare I know, but you do not want to be at the wrong end of a legal battle. Like the Release branch the RTM branch should never be deleted, or only deleted according to your companies legal policy, which in the UK is usually 7 years.</p>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"434\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_93c79151-dedd-41fe-bcaa-e064c7dff01e.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: If you have made any changes in the Release you will need to merge back up to Main in order to finalise the changes.</strong></p>\n<p>Nothing is really ever done done until it is in Main.

You need to do a Reverse Integration merge from the Release Branch into Main to carry the bug fixes over into the next sprint.</p>\n<p>Your Sprint is now nearly complete, and you can have a Sprint Review meeting knowing that you have made every effort and taken every precaution to protect your customer’s investment.</p>\n<p>Note: In order to really achieve protection for both you and your client you would add Automated Builds, Automated Tests, Automated Acceptance tests, Acceptance test tracking, Unit Tests, Load tests, Web test and all the other good engineering practices that help produce reliable software.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After branching Main to Release, we generally recommend not doing any subsequent merging (FI) from Main into the release branch.</p>\n<p>In our guidance we suggest that once you are ready to release your code, you would branch Main to Release (making the vCurrent). This allows you to open Main for vNext development and stabilization.</p>\n<p>If you later decide to merge hotfixes or service pack changes from Release to Main, you should be careful how you do this. It would probably NOT be a good idea to follow the same pattern we recommend for development (do one last FI from Main to Dev before doing the RI from Dev to Main). Doing one last FI from Main to Release would risk bringing vNext changes into Release.</p>\n<p>Note – vNext might mean sprintNext, but I think the same considerations apply. For vCurrent, especially after doing some hotfixes, the Release branch should be at a higher level of quality and stability than the Main branch. You don’t want to bring vNext code into the vCurrent Release branch any more than you want to bring vNext Feature code from Dev to Main before it passes quality gates in the Feature branch.</p>\n<p>- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/billheys/\"><strong>Bill Heys</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger &amp; TFS Branching Lead, Microsoft</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bill’s comments are quite pertinent here as you may think it is a good idea to do another forward integration to bring new features from Main into an existing Release. You can do it, its not recommended, but be very very careful.</p>\n<p>\_<img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"434\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_642dadbb-64ab-41b2-8873-1026a41cce9b.png\" /> <br />\n<strong>Figure: After the Sprint Planning meeting the process begins again.</strong></p>\n<p>Where the Sprint Review and Retrospective meetings mark the end of the Sprint, the Sprint Planning meeting marks the beginning.

But how do you handle that?</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/\"><strong>Willy-Peter Schaub</strong></a> asked an excellent question on the release activities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>In reality Sprint 2 starts when sprint 1 ends + weekend. Should we not cater for a possible parallelism between Sprint 2 and the release activities of sprint 1? It would introduce FI’s from main to sprint 2, I guess. Your “</i><strong>Figure: Merging Sprint 2 back into Main.</strong><i>” covers, what I tend to believe to be reality in most cases. <br />\n- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/willy-peter_schaub/\"><strong>Willy-Peter Schaub</strong></a>, VS ALM Ranger, Microsoft</i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree, and if you have a single Scrum team then your resources are limited. The Scrum Team is responsible for packaging and release, so at least one run at stabilization, package and release should be included in the Sprint time box. If more are needed on the current production release during the Sprint 2 time box then resource needs to be pulled from Sprint 2.</p>\n<p>The Product Owner and the Team have four choices (in order of disruption/cost):</p>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>Backlog</strong>: Add the bug to the backlog and fix it in the next Sprint</li>\n    <li><strong>Buffer Time</strong>: Use any buffer time included in the current Sprint to fix the bug quickly</li>\n    <li><strong>Make time</strong>: Remove a Story from the current Sprint that is of equal value to the time lost fixing the bug(s) and releasing. <br />\n    Note: The Team must agree that it can still meet the Sprint Goal.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cancel Sprint</strong>: Cancel the sprint and concentrate all resource on fixing the bug(s) <br />\n    Note: This can be a very costly if the current sprint has already had a lot of work completed as it will be lost.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The choice will depend on the complexity and severity of the bug(s) and both the Product Owner and the Team need to agree. In this case we will go with option #2 or #3 as they are uncomplicated but severe bugs.</p>\n<p><img border=\"0\" alt=\"image\" width=\"634\" height=\"434\" style=\"border-right-width: 0px;margin: 0px 20px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-ABranchingstrategyfor_E931-image_760c1234-3150-4be4-af01-ca9fea847079.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Figure: Real world issue where a bug needs fixed in the current release.</strong></p>\n<p>If the bug(s) is urgent enough then then your only option is to fix it in place.

      Hi,<br /><br />What portions of the sprint timebox do you typically
      allocate to sprint branch development vs merging back to Main and
      branching for release, etc?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Jason

      As much as needed but no more :) <br /><br />Not a good answer, but the
      only one I have. It will change from team to team depending on the skills
      of the team member and complexity of the product and its packaging
      process.<br /><br />As the team matures and implements more automation in
      its processes it should get quicker and be able to do more. <br /><br />
      There would be very little time spent actually branching and merging as
      with a single sprint branch the merge is painless. After the R0.1 merging
      the changes into main in painless, but merging into Sprint n would be more
      difficult. Its just part of the price of building good software.<br />

      Very nice article and I like the approach.<br /><br />What's your approach
      when you have multiple scrum teams working in parallel on the same
      product?  I have trouble with and always revert to something manual or do
      a bit of overtime to get everything ready for the next sprint set but it
      alwayd feels a little bit "Unagile" to me!<br /><br />We try and keep the
      teams working to the same dates but we still need to manage the merging
      back in.  What do you do if the first team merges in and finds critical
      bugs as you have outlined.  The 2nd and 3rd teams need to get onto their
      next sprints but how do you handle their code merging if it relies on the
      bug being fixed?<br />

      You mention "Nothing is really ever done done until it is in Main". I
      found the following arcticle about being "done" very helpful.
      &lt;http://mitchlacey.com/Scrum/Defining-Done.html&gt; Maybe you should
      add it to this post. Having a done list to get to main is VERY beneficial.

      Fantastic article on theory, i found this more useful that the team
      rangers 'take' on branch names specifically in the RTM and Release area.
      <br /><br />I have a question regarding the practicalities of implementing
      this model in team build In particular how team build should handle
      version stamping in the Release branches. <br /><br />Our Dev and Main
      team builds take the standard 'Build 20100603.1' naming convention in team
      build. <br /><br />We perform early beta releases directly from Dev
      Branches for testing, and a fully integrated release for manual testing
      will be done from the most current Release Branch.<br /><br />It is not
      clear whether when a stabilising a production release coming from the
      current release branch, which has the potential to go through a few manual
      testing cycles,  should be version stamped in the same manner as Dev and
      Main with a datetime stamp, or whether it should commence proper version
      stamping such as V1.0.0. There appears to be trade offs under both
      scenarios. <br /><br />If datetime stamp versioning is used:<br />A
      Release would need to have its version changed on the decision to turn it
      to RTM. Changing a version number doesnt appear possible in the team build
      explorer. Another build agent could be setup to do a production release
      over a branch which will do a version stamp, but then the release will
      have 2 identities, which is sounding to far away from the out of the box
      intent of 'Build Quality'<br /><br /><br />Each Release Build gets a
      proper version stamping for every build:<br />This works perfect in the
      team build explorer as you would simply change the build quality to
      "Release", but the problem is here is that you would start burning V1.x
      numbers. From an aesthetic point of view there would be gaps in the
      version numbers in your read only RTM area. <br />the first version of V1
      that is released could be V1.7. It would be preferable that the first
      release always goes out as V1.0 with only hot fix released incrementing
      the second number and in a sequential manner. <br /><br />As i side note
      this is how we have implemented the model from a branching naming point of
      view. <br /><br />Dev<br /> - Dev1<br /> - Dev2 (only needed if we need
      whereby there is concurrent vNext development whereby the changes are in
      conflict with Dev1)<br /><br />Main<br /><br />Release<br /> - R1.0
      (Remains here for hot fixes which will build on top of each other)<br /> -
      R1.1 (as above)<br /> - R1.2 The current stabilising release<br />RTM<br
      />- V1.0.0<br />- V1.0.1<br />- V1.1.0<br />- V1.1.1<br /><br /><br
      />Intersted to here anyones thoughts on this.<br /><br /><br /><br />

      Hi Ogabi, <br /><br />The diagrams are very likely done using Microsoft
      Visio plus the Branching templates provided in the Visual Studio Branching
      Guide 2010 produced by the ALM Rangers. The Visio template and much more
      is available for download at http://tfsbranchingguideiii.codeplex.com/.

      Would you comment a little on the multiple branches (DEV, QA, MAIN, FIX)
      and breaking down security for each branch.  We are thinking that we would
      only allow developers in the DEV branch, our QA group would be the only
      team that can Merge from Dev to QA,  Release could only Merge from QA to
      Main.  What is your take on this approach?

      Hi Martin,<br /><br />A typical scenario we have created branching for
      Development and Bug Fixing. The Development creates new classes and the
      release is planned always at the end of month. The bug fixes are client to
      client basis and we have periodic releases which are tested and provided
      as and when a bug is reported. While working,  for files where you have
      made changes to both the source and the target, merging the changes will
      result in conflicts. Can you help us how to resolve this scenario in TFS
      2008. Thanks in advance!

      Hi,<br />What do you think about Martin Fowler's mantra "every developer
      needs to continuously check into main, no branches allowed"?<br
      />Thanks,<br />Paolo

      Thanks for this post. I use this as a reference every time I need guidance
      on how I should be branching/merging to keep a coherent build/release
      strategy.

      Ella, I would say that the very worst possible thing that you could do
      would be to "BOK" your investment in agility and cripple your ability to
      deliver value with a guide on how not to do agility. Go for the
      http://scrum.org/scrum-guide as the official word on Scrum from its
      creators Jeff &amp; Ken. If you need more help than the official guide
      then find a legitimate scrum organisation through http://scrum.org (my
      preference) or through http://scrumalliance.com. The links that you have
      posed above will lead to pain and suffering for teams and organisations
      struggling to do things right.

      Oh, Sir it's so good and practical I'm using it in my project, but Sir I'm
      confused a bit now in applying my MVC Code First Migration strategy using
      VS 2013, where to start? which branches should use migration and where
      should not.

      Dear Sirs any body can help?, Thanks

      This was guidance from 2010. I would recommend that you move to Git and do
      Git Flow for a branching strategy.

      Thanks, for the post I'll post it in my board, it's more reasonable and
      support the needs for separating a feature with related developer, but I
      couldn't catch the needs for a the master branch in the presence of the
      release branch (we may consider it as RTM branch)

      Excellent article!

      I am new to TFS and have a few questions... :-)

      After 4 years, are there any lessons learned with this process that you
      are doing differently now?

      When would labels be used in this process?

      At what point would the changesets be associated with work items? Trying
      to determine the appropriate branch to incorporate the Work Item Check-In
      Policy.

      Would it be appropriate to do a Gated Check-In on both the Sprint and Main
      branches?

      Would there be multiple merges from child to parent during a Sprint, so
      the independent test team can test while developers are coding?

      Goodness me yes, @ssswish65:disqus. Don't branch. Ever (caveat: unless
      Git, then branch for for no more than a day). I have an updated post in
      the works... Use Feature toggles and do not use feature or sprint
      branching.
