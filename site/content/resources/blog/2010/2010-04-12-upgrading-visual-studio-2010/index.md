![vs2010_ultimate_web](images/UpgradingVisualStudio2010_D9B8-vs2010_ultimate_web_-8-6.jpg)I have been running Visual Studio 2010 as my main development studio on my development computer since the RC was released. I need to upgrade that to the RTM, but first I need to remove it. Microsoft have done a lot of work to make this easy, and it works. Its as easy as uninstalling from the control panel.

I have had may previous versions of Visual Studio 2010 on this same computer with no need to rebuild to remove all the bits.

**Figure: The uninstall removes everything for you.**

**Figure: A green tick means the everything went OK. If you get a red cross, try installing the RTM anyway and it should warn you with what was not uninstalled properly and you can remove it manually.**

Once you have VS2010 RC uninstalled installing should be a breeze. The install for 2010 is much faster than 2008. Which could take all day, and then some on slower computers. This takes around 20 minutes even on my small laptop. I always do a full install as although I have to do c# I sometimes get to use a proper programming language ![Smile](images/UpgradingVisualStudio2010_D9B8-wlEmoticon-smile_2-2-8.png) VB.NET. Seriously, there is nothing worse than trying to open a project and the other developer has used something you don't have. Its not their fault. Its yours! Save yourself the angst and install Fully, its only 5.9GB.

**Figure: I always select all of the options.**

If you have just uninstalled the .NET 4 RC then you will probably be asked to restart ![Sad](images/UpgradingVisualStudio2010_D9B8-wlEmoticon-sad_2-1-7.png) But it is a necessary evil.

**Now go forth and develop! Preferably in VB.NET…**
