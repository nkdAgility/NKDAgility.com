[![DDD](images/2139dc5039e8_9EA4-DDD_thumb-2-1.png)](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-2139dc5039e8_9EA4-DDD_2.png)Since I have joined SSW as a Solution Architect its Chief Architect, Adam Cogan, has been mentoring me and pushing me to do better. One of the things that I have been wanting to do since the first DDD Scotland was to present a session. For DDD Scotland 2010 Adam suggested that I submit he double session on “Better project Management with Team Foundation Server 2010”.

So, with some apprehension I submitted two session as Part A and Part B.

How surprised was I that after the attendees had finished casting their votes that both sessions would be in the top 20 one in the top 5. I an effort to promote diversity in sessions the DDD committee try to make sure that each presenter only have one session. I would have to compress SSW’s presentation into 1 hour.

Around this time SSW embarked on it continuing adventures with scrum an Microsoft started heavily investing in Scrum for its internal use. I decided to do a slightly different session, but one that would still meet the agenda and goal of the billed session to provide “Better project management with Team Foundation Server 2010”.

And so [Scrum with Team Foundation Server 2010](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/04/09/scrum-for-team-foundation-server-2010.aspx) was born. At this stage I really have to thank [Aaron Bjork](http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronbjork) who provided me with many of the slides and animations as I really can’t work Power Point.

On the 27th of April I presented the session for the Aberdeen Partner Group and then on 8th May I presented at [DDD Scotland](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2010/).

I mentioned quite a few of SSW’s [Rules to better Scrum Using TFS](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS) and I have uploaded my presentation to Skydrive.
