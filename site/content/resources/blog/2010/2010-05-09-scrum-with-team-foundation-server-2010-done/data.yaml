One of the things that I have been wanting to do since the first DDD Scotland was to present a session. For DDD Scotland 2010 Adam suggested that I submit he double session on “Better project Management with Team Foundation Server 2010”.</p>  <p>So, with some apprehension I submitted two session as Part A and Part B.</p>  <br />  <hr />  <p><strong>Download </strong><a href=\"http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Presentations/SSW^_Scrum%20with%20TFS%202010^_DDDScotland^_v1.1.pptx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DDD Scotland -\_ Scrum with Team Foundation Server 2010</strong></a></p>  <p>How surprised was I that after the attendees had finished casting their votes that both sessions would be in the top 20 one in the top 5. I an effort to promote diversity in sessions the DDD committee try to make sure that each presenter only have one session. I would have to compress SSW’s presentation into 1 hour.</p>  <p>Around this time SSW embarked on it continuing adventures with scrum an Microsoft started heavily investing in Scrum for its internal use. I decided to do a slightly different session, but one that would still meet the agenda and goal of the billed session to provide “Better project management with Team Foundation Server 2010”.</p>  <p>And so <a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2010/04/09/scrum-for-team-foundation-server-2010.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Scrum with Team Foundation Server 2010</a> was born. At this stage I really have to thank <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronbjork\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Bjork</a> who provided me with many of the slides and animations as I really can’t work Power Point. </p>  <p>On the 27th of April I presented the session for the Aberdeen Partner Group and then on 8th May I presented at <a href=\"http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2010/\" target=\"_blank\">DDD Scotland</a>.</p>  <p><img alt=\"dddscot-trademark-shot by Craig Murphy.\" src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4593134708_cf386c551a.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" />    <br /><strong>Figure: Some of the presenters and organisers of DDD Scotland</strong></p>  <p>I mentioned quite a few of SSW’s <a href=\"http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS\" target=\"_blank\">Rules to better Scrum Using TFS</a> and I have uploaded my presentation to Skydrive.</p>  <p>\_</p>  <p><strong>Download </strong><a href=\"http://cid-57599e234f1ebc1c.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Presentations/SSW^_Scrum%20with%20TFS%202010^_DDDScotland^_v1.1.pptx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DDD Scotland -\_ Scrum with Team Foundation Server 2010</strong></a></p>  <br />    <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Scrum\" rel=\"tag\">Scrum</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/TFS+2010\" rel=\"tag\">TFS 2010</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/DDD+Scot\" rel=\"tag\">DDD Scot</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Live\" rel=\"tag\">Live</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SSW\" rel=\"tag\">SSW</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2010\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2010</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint\" rel=\"tag\">SharePoint</a>\_</div>"
