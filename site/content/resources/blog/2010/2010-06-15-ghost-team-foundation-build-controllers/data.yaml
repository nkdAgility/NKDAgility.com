    <p class="lead">Have you ever seen ghost build controllers in Team
    Foundation Server that you just can't seam to delete no matter what you do?
    Sometime there are builds left over in the system that were queued but never
    completed.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <p><span class="label label-info">Update</span> Ulf Jonson pointed out that
    the value for 'canceled' should be 16 and not 2 as I had stated.
    Thanks&nbsp;Ulf, updated.</p>

    </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Most of the time they are easy to delete, but sometimes it takes a little
    effort. Even rarer are those times when something just will not go away no
    matter how much you try. Indeed we have had a ghost (phantom) team build
    controller hanging around for a while now, and it had defeated my best
    efforts to get rid of it.</p>

    <p>The build controller was from our old TFS server from before our <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/deploying-visual-studio-2010-team-foundation-server-beta-2-done/">TFS
    2010 beta 2 upgrade</a> and was really starting to annoy me. Every time I
    try to delete it I get the message:</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>Controller cannot be deleted because there are build in progress <br
    />-Manage Build Controller dialog</p>

    </blockquote>

    width="762" height="432" border="0" />&nbsp; <br /><strong>Figure: Deleting
    a ghost controller does not always work.</strong></p>

    <p>I ended up checking all of our 172 Team Projects for the build that was
    queued, but did not find anything. <a
    href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimlamb/">Jim Lamb</a> pointed me to the
    “tbl_BuildQueue” table in the team Project Collection database and sure
    enough there was the nasty little beggar.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;" alt="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Gettingridofghostteamfoundationbuildcont_9102-image_d0472736-d368-4b60-82a4-1065053c0f20.png"
    width="653" height="119" border="0" /> <br /><strong>Figure: The ghost build
    was easily spotted</strong></p>

    <p>Adam Cogan asked me:</p>

    <blockquote>

    <p>“Why did you suspect this one?”</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Well, there are a number of things that led me to suspect it:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>QueueId is very low: Look at the other items, they are in the thousands
    not single digits</li>

    <li>ControllerId: I know there is only one legitimate controller, and I am
    assuming that 6 relates to “zzUnicorn”</li>

    <li>DefinitionId: This is a very low number and I looked it up in
    “tbl_BuildDefinition” and it did not exist</li>

    <li>QueueTime: As we did not upgrade to TFS 2010 until late 2009 a date of
    2008 for a queued build is very suspect</li>

    <li>Status: A status of <del>2</del>16 means that it is still queued</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This build must have been queued long ago when we were using TFS 2008,
    probably a beta, and it never got cleaned up. As controllers are new in TFS
    2010 it would have created the “zzUnicorn” controller to handle any build
    servers that already exist. I had previously deleted the Agent, but leaving
    the controller just looks untidy.</p>

    <p>Now that the ghost build has been identified there are two options:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Delete the row</strong> <br />I would not recommend ever
    deleting anything from the database to achieve something in TFS. It is
    <em>really</em> not supported.</li>

    <li><strong>Set the Status to cancelled</strong> (Recommended) <br />This is
    the best option as TFS will then clean it up itself</li>

    </ul>

    <p>So I set the Status of this build to 2 (cancelled) and sure enough it
    disappeared after a couple of minutes and I was then able to then delete the
    “zzUnicorn” controller.</p>

    <p><img style="margin: 0px 20px; border-width: 0px;" alt="SNAGHTMLc40486"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/GWB-WindowsLiveWriter-Gettingridofghostteamfoundationbuildcont_9102-SNAGHTMLc40486.png"
    width="766" height="300" border="0" /> <br /><strong>Figure: Almost
    completely clean</strong></p>

    <p>Now all I have to do is get rid of that untidy “zzBunyip” agent, but that
    will require rewriting one of our build scripts which will have to wait for
    now.</p>

      "So I set the Status of this build to 2 (cancelled)"


      Is'nt it so that Cancel = 16? As stated earlier in the post "Status: A
      status of 2 means that it is still queued"


      0 – None

      1 – In progress

      2 – Queued

      4- Postponed

      8 – Completed

      16 – Cancelled

      also wanted to point out that you can see the ControllerId and related
      display name in the dbo.tbl_BuildController table.  No need to guess which
      Id goes with which controller


      How do you update the status of the builds? Through a SQL update query or
      somehow through the UI?
