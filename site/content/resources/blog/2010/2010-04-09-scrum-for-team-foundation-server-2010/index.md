If you are going to be at the Aberdeen Partner Group meeting on 27th April, or [DDD Scotland](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2010/default.aspx) on 8th May then you may be able to catch my session.

## Scrum for Team Foundation Server 2010 Synopsis

Visual Studio ALM (formerly Visual Studio Team System (VSTS)) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) are the cornerstones of development on the Microsoft .NET platform. These are the best tools for a team to have successful projects and for the developers to have a focused and smooth software development process. For TFS 2010 Microsoft is heavily investing in Scrum and has already started moving some teams across to using it.

Martin will not be going in depth with Scrum but you can find out more about Scrum by reading the [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrum.org/scrumguides/) and you can even asses your Scrum knowledge by having a go at the [Scrum Open Assessment](http://www.scrum.org/scrumopen/). You can also read SSW’s [Rules to Better Scrum using TFS](http://sharepoint.ssw.com.au/Standards/Management/RulesToBetterScrumUsingTFS/Pages/default.aspx) which have been developed during our own Scrum implementations.

Come and see Martin Hinshelwood, Visual Studio ALM MVP and Solution Architect from SSW show you:

- How to successfully gather requirements with User stories
- How to plan a project using TFS 2010 and Scrum
- How to work with a product backlog in TFS 2010
- The right way to plan a sprint with TFS 2010
- Tracking your progress
- The right way to use work items
- What you can use from the built in reporting as well as the Project portals available on from the SharePoint dashboard
- The important reports to give your Product Owner / Project Manager

Walk away knowing how to see the project health and progress. Visual Studio ALM is designed to help address many of these traditional problems faced by teams. It does so by providing a set of integrated tools to help teams improve their software development activities and to help managers better support the software development processes.

During this session we will cover the lifecycle of creating work items and how this fits into Scrum using Visual Studio ALM and Team Foundation Server.

If you want to know more about how to do Scrum with TFS then there is a new course that has been created in collaboration with Microsoft and Scrum.org that is going to be the official course for working with TFS 2010.

SSW has [Professional Scrum Developer Trainers](http://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Events/Scrum-Training-Course.aspx) who specialise in training your developers in implementing Scrum with Microsoft's Visual Studio ALM tools.
