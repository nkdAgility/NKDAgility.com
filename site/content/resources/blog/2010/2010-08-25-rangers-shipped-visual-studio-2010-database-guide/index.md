Have you ever struggled with the Database Developer (was DataDude) components of Visual Studio? Well I have…and now the ALM Rangers have released a new guide to help us all get the benefits. There is Guidance as well as Hands-On-Labs and even how to do WIX integration for deployment.

The [Visual Studio 2010 Database Guide](http://vsdatabaseguide.codeplex.com/) is available to download from Codeplex and you should try it out and submit some feedback. Wondering what this is all about? Well…

## Project Description

Practical guidance for Visual Studio 2010 Database projects, which is focused on 5 topic areas:

- Solution and Project Management
- Source Code Control and Configuration Management
- Integrating External Changes with the Project System
- Build and Deployment Automation with Visual Studio Database Projects
- Database Testing and Deployment Verification

This release includes common guidance, usage scenarios, hands on labs, and lessons learned from real world engagements and the community discussions.  
The goal is to deliver examples that can support you in real world scenarios, instead of an in-depth tour of the product features.

## Visual Studio ALM Rangers

This guidance is created by the Visual Studio ALM Rangers, who have the mission to provide out of band solutions for missing features or guidance. This content was created with support from Microsoft Product Group, Microsoft Consulting Services, Microsoft Most Valued Professionals (MVPs) and technical specialists from technology communities around the globe, giving you a real-world view from the field, where the technology has been tested and used.
