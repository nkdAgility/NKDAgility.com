I have fought many battles, against Jira, Confluence and Subversion, but they are currently wining. I cant seam to get the Architecture &amp; Strategy guys to get behind the project. They are sitting on the sidelines encouraging me, but with no active participation. </p> <p>Time and again I am running up against the\_problem that no one will read any of the content that I have provided. It is difficult to fight a battle on many fronts and the fact that Visual Studio 2005 Team Foundation Server is such an excellent product with complete integration between all of its services is actually not working in its favor.</p> <p>Others are able to concentrate on selling Jira to one group of people while others are concentrating on selling Subversion. I have to lobby them all...</p> <p>The call has now come down from on high to have all Risks and Issues stored in Jira.

      I lost the same battle a few months ago but learned to accept the fact my
      company doesn't want to spend money in new server to host TFS and the the
      expensive CALs that is tied with it.<br /><br />Oh well, I'll just fiddle
      with Subversion till one of the head honchos realize that TFS is a better
      solution.

      Martin,<br /><br />As a colleague, I am equally saddened that the powers
      that be have gone in favour of the poorer choice tracker. <br /><br />I am
      not privy to why Jira was selected over TFS. They may have chosen Jira as
      it is perceived as User friendly and an out of the box solution. I
      certainly don’t find it User Friendly and can’t imagine the solution we
      are faced with came from a box. More than likely the output of an
      extortionately priced insultancy visit. <br /><br />They may have taken to
      Jira because non technical users can add Issues by pressing a button and
      populating a form. This is also available in TFS but it comes with
      unnecessary baggage which needs to be dropped.<br /><br />The fact that
      everything is an Issue in Jira - yes even Risks are Issues - does not seem
      to have deterred the herd instinct decision to promote Jira over the
      superior TFS.<br /><br />Sadly, the fact remains that until TFS contains
      idiot-proof, user-friendly, simple, default forms to capture Risks,
      Issues, Assumptions and Dependencies and provides a simple default set of
      reports which work at both the project and program level, TFS will
      continue to please the techies, frustrate the Business Users thus leaving
      the decision makers to opt for the perceived business benefits of inferior
      tools.<br /><br />In a few years, choosing TFS will be a no brainer, until
      then thanks for the loan of the TFS text book, which I will return. Now
      where did I put my idiots guide to Jira?<br />

      For the avoidance of doubt, I have also stated that TFS &amp;quot;...comes
      with unnecessary baggage which needs to be dropped.&amp;quot;<br /><br />I
      am delighted to get along. So much so I am currently struggling to come to
      terms with using Jira, after spending a lot of time adding reporting
      queries to TFS and lobbying the Evanelist for User Friendly
      improvements.<br /><br />Integration or better synchronisation between
      Jira and TFS must be worth considering.<br /><br />Round 1 to Jira.<br
      />Ding ding, round 2.

      Be careful with TFS -- it is virtually impossible to restore team
      foundation server data.  I, along with one other developer, have just
      spent the better part of the weekend (20+ hours) attempting to restore TFS
      data with no luck (even after multiple reinstalls and a complete wiping of
      the disk and reinstallation of windows 2003) <br /><br />It's super-easy
      to backup TFS -- just backup the SQL server DB and reporting services
      encryption key.   That's one of the attractive features of TFS -- you can
      back it up as part of your SQL server maintenance plan.<br /><br
      />However, try to restore the data and you quickly realize that this is
      not a robust product. <br /><br />Read this:<br
      />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252458(VS.80).aspx<br /><br
      />Then realize that you can't follow those instructions, because something
      in your system configuration has changed (DNS, domain, user names, etc),
      so you try this:<br
      />http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404869(VS.80).aspx<br /><br
      />Then get an ambiguous error message: "Failed to read from the
      registration database" during the reinstall, for which there are all of 2
      pages in Google.   Now you understand my pain!<br /><br />best of luck
      with your project, but tfs is just not ready for prime time -- it's great
      when it works, but when it doesn't it is impossible to get working again.

      It's actually not that difficult to perform either a restore or a restore
      on another machine if you understand the components of TFS and follow the
      instructions. <br /><br />I have just completed (one guy) the "Move TFS to
      another hardware configuration" restore and finished it successfully in
      under 10 hours, fully functional.<br /><br />The regular restore method
      takes 15minutes + the time it take to actually restore the databases.

      I am trying to compare TFS Work Items and Jira.<br />From what I see, TFS
      Work Items are more sophisticated, easier to create workflows etc. , but
      you need a CAL or some other way to access them, which could be a problem
      for us.
