    <p>As part of the Scrum.org webinar “Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer -
    Martin Hinshelwood - Answering Your Most Pressing Scrum Questions” I was
    asked a number of questions. Since not only was I on the spot and live, I
    thought that I should answer each question that was asked again here, as
    well as those questions I did not get to.</p><p>In case you missed it, here
    is the recording of yesterday's Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer webinar
    with Martin Hinshelwood! Watch here: <a
    href="http://ow.ly/ijiM50vwEkD">http://ow.ly/ijiM50vwEkD</a><h3>[Question]
    In Nexus with 5 Scrum teams, how can the Product Owner attend all Sprint
    Planning events?</h3></p><p>As you increase the number of Teams in a Nexus
    you can very quickly run into this common scaling issue. While Nexus talks
    about a single Product Owner who has overall accountability and ownership of
    the Product Backlog, you may need to scale the Product Owner role as your
    Nexus grows. My usual starting point here is to look at how the Product
    Backlog is decomposed. It may be that my Product Owner only provides
    detailed leadership down to the Feature level and not to the Product Backlog
    Level. This leaves the Scrum Team with ownership there, and releases
    pressure on the Product Owner. The Product Owner would then only require to
    attend the Nexus Sprint Planning portion, and would delegate the rest. As
    long as the Product Owner effectively communicates their vision &amp;
    expectations as part of the Nexus Sprint Goals, the Scrum Teams should be
    able to work towards fulfilling them.<blockquote><p>Product Backlog Items
    can be delivered in a singe Sprint with a preference for
    smaller.</p><p>Features are too big for a single team Sprint and may be
    delivered across multiple Sprints or Teams</p><p>Epics are too big for a
    Release and would be composed of many Features.</p><p>-Martin
    Hinshelwood</p></blockquote></p><p>Each Scrum Team would then be free to
    choose how they manage this and make sure that they have enough ready
    Backlog Items for their part of Sprint Planning. Usually they will
    designate, or have, a virtual Product Owner that is dedicated to their team.
    This virtual PO role could be called a “Area Owner” if their Scrum Team is
    focused on only one area of the Product, or a “Team Owner” if there are many
    teams in the same area. This is roughly how the Azure DevOps engineering
    teams break down:</p><p><br /></p><p>-Product Owner<blockquote><p>|----Work
    Item Product Owner</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |---
    Team A Product Owner</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    |---Team B Product Owner</p><p>|----Source Control Product
    Owner</p><p>|----etc.</p></blockquote></p><p><br /></p><p>In this case they
    have ~42 teams that roll up to ~6 Product Areas, and is just one example of
    how you might structure things. The danger is in disrupting the flow of
    information by increasing the distance between the Product Owner and the
    Development Team. The Azure DevOps engineering teams mitigate this with
    Autonomy. Each Area Owner is only looking at their functional area while
    fulfilling the vision set by the Product Owner, and the Team Owner is
    communicating constantly with their peers and the Area Owner. </p><p>If you
    do implement some kind of hierarchy I recommend focusing on keeping it as
    flat as posible and understanding that each of these folks, Product Owner,
    Area Owner, &amp; Team Owner are fulfilling the role of the Product Owner as
    per the Scrum Guide as part of a Scrum Team. For the question above I would
    likely start with a dedicated Team Owner for each team that is the
    representative that attends the Nexus Sprint Planning and that works closely
    with the Product Owner. This will likely need close monitoring and a skilled
    Scrum Master to help coach the teams to maintain communication and not loose
    focus.</p><p>While there are no right answers there are some answers that
    are better than others. For your given situation select the most right
    answer, and iteration to the best version of it.</p>
