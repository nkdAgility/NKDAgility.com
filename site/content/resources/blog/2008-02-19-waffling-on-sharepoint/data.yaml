  - "<p>Documentation, documentation and more documentation.. The life blood of IT. The only problem being that it is very difficult for a technically minded individual such as myself to write documentation with NO technical content what so ever! These documents are what the business really want; They do not care that the workflow capabilities of SharePoint bring easer workflow to the masses, they only care that it is there; They do not care that we will be deploying on 2 front end servers with 1 application server and a database server for the first initial farm, they only care that it will work.</p>\n<p>With this in mind how do you impress upon them the potential of the system? Well... you don't, you can only build a system with the capabilities that you think they will need and once you get down to the details of migrating their applications will you actually get any meaningfully feedback..</p>\n<p>That is the advantage of using SharePoint. It can do pretty much anything: If not out of the box, then you can build on it, or get contractors to work on it...</p>\n<p>Its all about standards...</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SP+2007\" rel=\"tag\">SP 2007</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/MOSS\" rel=\"tag\">MOSS</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/SharePoint\" rel=\"tag\">SharePoint</a>\_</div>"
