    <p class="lead">With the release of Team Foundation Server 2013 I need to
    upgrade all of my servers. I have a few customer installs getting prepped
    and I wanted to get a look see.</p>

    <p>I run a TFS server locally to do demos; prove out the existence, or lack,
    of bugs; and to figure out what is going on under the covers. This server
    (Kraken) is a virtual machine running locally and can easily be backed up
    and restored. My recommendation is to never attempt an upgrade without a
    backup and preferably upgrade to a new server.</p>

    <ul>

    <li><span class="label label-info">Update</span> 2013-07-23 - Another
    seamless upgrade. This time with 8 collection and then a consolidation down
    to a single Team Project</li>

    </ul>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    target="_blank">Get Visual Studio 2013 &amp; Team Foundation Server 2013
    while its hot!</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>The main reason for a new server is that there are some major changes to
    the OS as part of the Team Foundation Server install. There is usually some
    sort of .NET update as well as core Windows components. Backup and Snapshot
    or use a new VM its up to you…</p>

    Scheduled Backups on Team Foundation Server 2012</small></p>

    <p>My first order of business is to take an in place backup and a snapshot
    of my VM. In this case I am upgrading in place and I can rollback with both
    of these options. If you are moving to a new server and will be changing the
    location of the backups make sure you check out <a
    href="http://nkdagility.com/tfs-2012-3-issue-scheduled-backups-gives-a-tf400998/">TFS
    2012.3 Issue – Scheduled Backups gives a TF400998 when reconfigured</a> as I
    ran into a little issue with that recently. It is most likely to occur when
    also doing a domain migration, but can just be moving servers.</p>

    Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>I always opt for the default path and recommend that you do the same.
    This is no value to moving it to another disk and that only adds complexity.
    Certainly have all of your data on another disk, but putting files that you
    need to reinstall anyway on another disk is a little silly.</p>

    Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>The install is smooth as always and the polish is amazing. The only thing
    that I can grip about is the need to reboot.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Rebooting during install of
    Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>I always feel that this is unnecessary but when you are talking about
    some of the core components for Windows I guess you have to just suck it up
    and reboot.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"
    title="image" alt="image"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: 5 minutes later we have Team
    Foundation Server 2013 installed</small></p>

    <p>No really, it only took 5 minutes to install and I did not prep the
    machine at all. I am however using Windows Server 2012 with SQL Server 2012
    and I have the latest updates for both. And that includes <strong>SQL Server
    2012 SP1 which is required</strong> for Team Foundation Server 2013.</p>

    <ul>

    2012</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>After you have everything up to scratch you can go ahead and configure. I
    will be using the Upgrade wizard but you may be installing from scratch so
    read the text on the right for each option carefully to get it right. Pay
    close attention to anything that mentions SQL Express as you may or may not
    want that.</p>

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Running the Upgrade gauntlet
    with Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>Running the upgrade is pretty easy but you will need a few bits of
    information. First up is the acceptance that you do indeed have a backup. If
    you don’t… go make one now… yes… even if this is your trial box. Have a
    backup..</p>

    for Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>As all of the account details are encrypted and as a security measure for
    your data you need to re-enter your passwords to connect everything up.
    Enter the password and click “test'”.. did you get a green tick?</p>

    for Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>As I have all of the reporting bits installed I will need to configure
    them. SharePoint however I don’t have here, but I will be creating another
    post for that.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;

    width="800" height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Validate your
    Report Server Instance for Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>Most of these screens are just validation and while I am restoring to the
    same server you may be having to change a few things to match a new
    environment. If you are moving your reporting services server off to another
    environment you should un-tick the box on the first screen for Reporting and
    reconfigure it after.</p>

    <p>Once you have validated all of the details and entered the Report Reader
    account password (did you get all green ticks) you can move on to the
    upgrade validation step (remember I have no SharePoint here.)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left:
    0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Validate that the settings
    are correct for Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>The Readiness Checks make sure that everything that can be checked is. It
    validates that what you entered works and that the servers and services are
    available. It checks permissions and access so you are fairly certain at
    this point that everything will work. There be odd and occasional data
    issues but I rarely see them beyond server that have multi terabyte
    databases.</p>

    <p>I get a TF255193 warning because I am using the same account for
    reporting as for the TFS Service account and that is deemed a risk. On a
    production box I agree, here I don't care.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Upgrading the Configuration
    data of Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>The upgrade really happens in three stages. The first stage is the flat
    installation of the files. TFS 2012 has been uninstalled and the new bits
    for Team Foundation Server 2013 which we did before we started any
    configuration of Team Foundation Server.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"
    title="image" alt="image"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Success at upgrading the
    Configuration to Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>The second is the setup of the system and upgrade of the Configuration
    database. This sets up IIS, creates the websites, application pools and
    configures reporting before upgrading the Configuration database. And we
    have not yet even looked at the collections</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;
    margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;"
    title="image" alt="image"

    height="500" border="0" /><br /><small>Figure: Collections upgrade
    asynchronously in Team Foundation Server 2013</small></p>

    <p>Each of the Team Project Collection will be attached and upgraded
    asynchrony and the bigger they are the longer they take. In this case I
    don’t have a Team Project Collection over a couple of gig and it was all
    over in under 10 minutes. Now you may be thinking "But Martin you have a
    really small databases of course it only took 10 minutes but I have more
    data". Well for this I wanted to maintain a table of expectant times as this
    has often been a common:</p>

    <p>This upgrade was totally painless (which does not mean that yours will
    be) and I could not believe that the Team Foundation Server Product Team
    would yet again make it easier but it just seams a little slicker than
    before.</p>

    <p>So did it work?</p>

    <p>Awesome.. Now all I have to do is upgrade the process templates to the
    new version and I will get all of the awesome features.</p>

    <p>Guess what I am doing next?</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>I would definitely recommend that you move to Team Foundation Server 2013
    as soon as you are able, especially if you are on 2012.3 already. If you are
    happy to work with Go-Live then you should look no further than 2013… at
    least until 2013.1 comes around…</p>

      Hi Martin,


      I have upgrade from TFS2012.2 to TFS 2013 preview. Except SharePoint
      portal everything else working ok. I did this as in place upgrade (done in
      a testing VM before attempting on production). SharePoint Foundation 2013
      was configured earlier with TFS 2012.2 and was working well. But after the
      upgrade to 2013 (SharePoint configuration went smoothly), Web part loading
      error below is coming in the project portals of all team projects. But if
      I add the same web part in SharePoint (duplicate) , the newly added web
      part works fine. Doing this for all project is not a n easy task
      considering the number of Team projects. I followed
      (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tfssetup/archive/2012/05/01/a-web-part-or-web-form-control-on-the-page-cannot-be-displayed-or-imported-the-type-could-not-be-found-or-it-is-not-registered-as-safe.aspx) 
      post and verified , in my SharePoint.. “Visual Studio Team Foundation
      Server Configuration” + v11 + v12  features are activated. If you could
      give any idea on this that would be greatly helpful. Thanks.


      Web Part Error: A Web Part or Web Form Control on this Page cannot be
      displayed or imported. The type
      Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WebAccess.WebParts.WorkItemSummaryWebPart,
      Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WebAccess.WebParts, Version=11.0.0.0,
      Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a could not be found or it
      is not registered as safe. Correlation ID:
      ce582f9c-918a-30d5-0000-07a060759890.



      similar error for all web parts

      You will need to un-install the TFS 2012 SharePoint tools from your
      SharePoint server and install the 2013 ones. Can you confirm this?


      Also you may need to deactivate the "feature" and reactivate it. That
      should be part of the upgrade but I am not sure of the order.

      HI Martin, 


      Thanks for helping me out in this... I have tried the upgrade 3 -4 times
      now with different approaches, but no good result for the existing Team
      project SharePoint portals. Below are my attempts


      Initial env. - Win 2012/SQL 2012 SP1 CU 2/ SharePoint 2013/ TFS 2012.2


      1. Backup TFS DBs, Install TFS 2013, Configure TFS Upgrade wizard --&gt;
      All ok except SharePoint sites for existing projects


      2. Backup TFS DBs, Remove SharePoint extension from TFS 2012.2 Admin
      Console, Uninstall TFS 2012.2, Install TFS 2013, Configure TFS Upgrade
      wizard --&gt; All ok except SharePoint sites for existing projects


      3. Backup TFS DBs, Deactivate TFS SharePoint Extensions in SharePoint
      central Admin, Uninstall TFS 2012.2, Install TFS 2013, Configure TFS
      Upgrade wizard, Activated TFS SharePoint Extensions in SharePoint central
      Admin --&gt; All ok except SharePoint sites for existing projects


      Tried deactivating and activating TFS SharePoint Extensions several
      times.. still no luck


      But if I edit Team Portal page in SharePoint and add it the web part again
      it works for that web part. I think it is picking the correct version when
      I do that


      Any of above attempts no errors in logs ..everything went as green..


      Any help would be greatly appreciated..

      Hi Martin,


      I upgraded a TFS 2012 demo virtual machine to TFS 2013. Everything was
      done smoothly with SQL 2012 SP1.


      Activated new Features in the existing collections/projects.


      But as I wanted to upgrade or setup the Build Service System, I got the
      message: "The register command is not supprted for Team Foundation
      Server.... because the server is not compatible"


      Any experience with this situation?


      Regards


      Thorsten

      Are you using the VM from Brian Keller? If so then you need to reset the
      date/time to 'now' before you do any of the upgrades...

      Hi, You mention keeping the install location of TFS to its default
      location - and I remember there was once a bug in one of the updates that
      expected the install to be in default location - however the AT can
      consume quite a lot of disk space over time as it acts like a proxy (mine
      has reached over 100GB within the folder E:Program FilesMicrosoft Team
      Foundation Server 11.0Application TierWeb Services_tfs_data) Which is why
      I normally install to a different drive. I drop this folder every time I
      run a update as the install takes forever otherwise.

      Thanks

      Gary

      There is a cache directory in there that you can redirect using a
      web.config setting.  In the application tier web.config (~Application
      TierWeb Servicesweb.config) you should add the following setting to the
      appSettings section:

          


      This will redirect that large data repository to another drive.

      Upgrading from TFS 2010 works great! I have only done a couple of those
      but I had no problems. TFS 2008 however would need to be staged through
      2012.

      Hi Chaminda.

      I am running into the exact same scenario. I upgraded from TFS2012 Update
      1 to TFS2013 RC. I stood up a new Sharepoint 2013 instance and restored
      and migrated WSS_Content database. The upgrade was successful. Everything
      is functional expect the exceptions in Project Portals:

      Web Part Error: A Web Part or Web Form Control on this Page cannot be
      displayed or imported. The type
      Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WebAccess.WebParts.WorkItemSummaryWebPart,
      Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WebAccess.WebParts, Version=11.0.0.0,
      Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a could not be found or it
      is not registered as safe.

      Were you able to get this resolved, and if so how?

      Thanks.

      Greg

      Have you tried re-running the configuration tool that you run after an
      install. Sometimes that clears things out for me.

      Hello - I've got some developers who haven't checked their stuff in and
      are proving tardy at best. Can I upgrade (TFS2010 &gt; TFS 2103) and
      expect the workspace status etc. to go over as well?

      Short answer: Yes you can. There is no need to force everyone to check
      in. 

      Long answer: Even if you are moving hardware, which i would recommend do
      that you can upgrade SQL and Windows easily, the GUID inside of TFS stays
      the same and all of your guys workspaces will be migrated when they first
      connect... This does mean that if you want to do a trial upgrade first you
      will need to change that GUID to prevent calamities :)

      Martin, please clear it better to me the GUID issue: I'm planning a
      TFS2010-&gt;2013 migration with hw change. I would use new architeture for
      a testing period, using backuped data from production env. After TFS 2013
      configuration on new hardware and conversion of a restored db set from
      production (on a new MS SQL Server), how will I change the GUID to prevent
      the "calamities" for users during test on production?


      Second question: after the test period I'll do a final production db
      backup/restore/conversion on the new TFS2013 architecture from actual TFS
      2010 prod server: users will be able to connect to the new TFS url and all
      the local workspace will be autoconnected to the new server, is it right?

      If its a test upgrade run "tfsconfig changeserverid". Run "tfsconfig setup
      /uninstall:all" to reset the environment.

      I did "tfsconfig

      changeserverid", but now trying to connect from Visual Studio to the TFS
      server I'm getting a TFS30046 error: "The Instance information does not
      match"!!!


      I argue the original situation was fine... really not clear this point! Is
      it possible to have a configuration summary using the tfsconfig command?

      I think you must have run "tfsconfig changeserverid" before you configured
      TFS. You are getting the error as the "server ID" in the web.config in the
      root of the TFS server does not match the new server ID. If you "tfsconfig
      setup /uninstall:all" and then reconfigure you should be golden.


      note: If you do not change the server ID for your test environment then
      the client tools will detect a new server with the same ID and
      automatically migrate all of your workspaces a cash across to the new
      server. All users that have ever connected to both environments will
      encounter weird stuff until you cleanse the clients.
