    <p class="lead">You need quality enablement to achieve predictable delivery
    for your organisation which takes effort to achieve.</p>

    <p>I do a lot of ALM Assessments for companies and almost every customer
    that I speak to has unpredictable quality in the software delivery that they
    receive from their teams. This is not always the Development Teams fault and
    is often the result of an organisation that is finely tuned to minimise the
    ability to have a defined and predictable level of quality. In most cases
    this is due to a lack of a bar that quantifies the minimum things that need
    to be completed in order for and organisation to understand what i involved
    in each delivery. </p>

    <p>If you have no bar for delivery and thus no idea what needs to be
    completed for each thing to be delivered then how can you expect to make
    accurate (or at least as good as we can get) prediction on when things are
    going to be delivered? You would effectively have no empirical evidence to
    rely on for predictability of delivery. In addition, the varied quality
    level results in more bugs in production, which then puts those individuals’
    responsible for adding features under more pressure. If you put developers
    under pressure they will consistently and increasingly cut quality to meet
    the same deliverable. </p>

    <p>In addition many product backlogs lack acceptance criteria leaving the
    Development Team to guess at the basis by which the customer will accept
    that something is complete. Indeed because if this lack of acceptance
    criteria backlog items can often be deceptively large which puts the
    development team under greater pleasure for delivery and thus the cut
    quality. </p>

    <h2>Fix quality for improved predictability</h2>

    <p>The only way to successfully create predictable software delivery is to
    fix 3 of the 4 points of the Iron Triangle. In traditional software
    development quality is the hidden value and if you fix everything else it is
    Quality that suffers. Quality should be anchored with an explicit
    definition. </p>

    <ul>

    <li><b>Definition of Done</b> – Your DoD is the fixed measure or explicit
    definition of quality for your software development process. It is a short
    measurable checklist which mirrors shippable that can and is applied to
    every unit of work delivered. It can be hard to define but without it we
    don’t know how much work needs to be done in order to ship any backlog item.
    Apply it at least to the output of the iteration and ideally to every
    backlog item that you complete.  </li>

    <li><strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> – While the DoD is applied equally
    to every backlog item acceptance criteria only applies to an individual
    item. All conversations between the Development Team, Product Owner and the
    Business should be reflected in the acceptance criteria so that things that
    are discussed are mot missed. This also serves to understand scale and
    encourages breaking down backlog items into smaller units of work. Once you
    understand what needs to be done to complete an item, overly large items
    become transparently obvious.  </li>

    <li><b>Automated Builds – </b>Having automated builds that can measure the
    quality of your software is paramount to minimising the amount of work that
    the team needs to do to verify the software and creating automated
    acceptance tests and unit tests increase the validity of those builds.
    Ideally you should have an automated test (UI or Unit) for every acceptance
    criteria that was added to the backlog item.  </li>

    <li><b>Automated Deployment</b> – Having automated deployment will force the
    team to create working software and allow you to build and maintain
    something that will minimize the cost of delivery. If the Development Team
    knows that the business can choose to ship at any time they are then under
    pressure to maintain that ship-ability and thus quality. </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Doing all of these things will serve to make quality the goal not the
    lack of it.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The way that we have traditionally measured our development teams have
    finely tuned them to fluctuate quality in order to meet aggressive delivery
    schedules. However this fluctuating quality only serves to reduce our
    ability to deliver and annoy our customers when they find the resulting
    bugs.</p>

    <p>The goal is to increase quality not reduce it but first we need to be
    able to measure that quality and enforce it.</p>

      Good post. Like the focus on quality in contrast to feature creation. You
      can add a 5th point: Measuring technical debt. There are tools like
      Sonar/SQALE doing this automatically. However, the measured data needs to
      be calibrated and interpreted by an expert. I more like the approach that
      each Development Team is estimating their technica debt Sprint by Sprint
      and ev. compare it with an automatically measured debt.

      Forgot: And you need a governance process: Somebody needs to put his
      fingers in when the technical debt is rising since the team is focusing on
      features only. Who is this? Maybe Scrum Master, maybe a quality guy, ...?

      Why would you not use the velocity to determine the build up of technical
      debt. The problem with tools to do this for you is that they can only tell
      you about the types of technical debt that they are designed to find, what
      about the unknown?


      Regardless of the types of technical debt your velocity will reduce Sprint
      on Sprint if it is building up. Teams will spend more time struggling with
      that debt, whatever it is, and less time on features. This is your
      barometer of that debt.

      The whole Development Team needs to be responsible and accountable for
      delivering high quality working software that has no undone work. If you
      make someone else responsible then the Development Team can safely pass
      the buck... Give them help, but it is their problem to solve...

      This is absolutely true: The Development Team remains accountable. What I
      wanted to say is that sometimes an outsider has to point with the finger
      on the unpleasant truth of bad code/design and sometimes another force as
      to support the Development Team to convince the Product Owner that
      redesign is now more important than adding value.

      Decreasing velocity would be the perfect indicator for technical debt.
      Unfortunately, velocity varies:

      1.) from Sprint to Sprint. No need to explain this.

      2.) in the long term since the nature of the PBI's changes: From new
      functionality to smaller enhancements: This affects the size of the
      estimation. I've seen this with several teams.

      It is rather difficult to read the technical debt from the velocity alone.

      I think that increasing technical debt can be detected only by
      interpreting several signals:

      - Decreasing velocity

      - Development Team estimate how much of the Sprint time it lost with
      technical debt

      - Development Team discussion on technical debt each Sprint

      - Measuring code quality with e.g. Sonar and interpreting the changes
      since last Sprint(s)

      However, technical debt remains a quality issue.
