Unless you have been hiding under a rock you will have notices some recent fever over the TFS 2013 Preview. Well as you know that while [Team Foundation Server 2013 is production ready](http://nkdagility.com/team-foundation-server-2013-is-production-ready/) it still has that pesky “Preview” moniker on there. This “Preview” wording has prevented many companies from adopting TFS 2013 immediately, even though it is fully supported. To help resolve some of that resistance and get wider adoption the Product Team has committed some extra engineering resources to not just supporting your TFS 2013 instance, but helping you upgrade as well.

During the weekend of Friday 13th September until Sunday 15th September there will be Microsoft experts standing by to help you out at no charge with your production upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2013. The will not just be there in case you need help but will be available to assist you with your installation and configuration as well as an upgrade.
