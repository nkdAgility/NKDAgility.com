    <p class="lead">Many companies have started searching for self-organisation.
    That ideal or nirvana where teams can figure out how to work together
    effectively with limited or little direction to solve problems.  </p>

    <p>Many, including some of my colleagues, believe that this search for
    self-organisation is ultimately fruitless. While many of our customers don’t
    initially believe in its existence because they have never seen it my
    colleagues think it impossible because they see company after company fail
    to achieve it. This is mostly as companies that call use are not ding so
    because they are awesome but instead because they see that they have some
    problem that needs looking into. These companies, while realising the need
    to change, tend to have an organisational structure and culture that
    presents an anti-pattern for self organising teams to ever exist. Oh, you
    will occasionally find small pockets of self-organisation within an
    organisation but if anyone tries to roll this dynamic out, it is ultimately
    demonstrated as unworkable due to those anti-patterns and those required
    traits and patterns are then ground out of people.  </p>

    <p>Realism dictates that we need to move slowly towards self-organisation in
    a way that will build up the self esteem of teams and create an environment
    for them to thrive. But the organisation also needs to have courage and
    conviction in order to realise it as the path to agility is a bumpy one and
    long, depending on how traditional they are to begin with.<br />

    <h2>Why self-organisation at all?</h2>

    </p>

    <p>If we don’t have self-organisation then don’t we have our least skilled
    and appropriate individuals (project managers) determining how, when and
    were any work should be completed. Should we not have the knowledgeable and
    skilled professionals that we hired to do the job of developing the product
    decide on the how, when and where?  </p>

    <p>If we don’t have self-organisation then how can we hope to hold the
    Development Team accountable for delivering the work? They can always blame
    the organiser!  </p>

    <p>If we don't have self-organisation then how do we know how much time
    should we spend on training of new individuals? Do we guess at their current
    skills or evaluate them with standardised tests that have done so well for
    our school system? Or should we not rely on their peers to make sure that
    each team member has the skills and knowledge required to help the
    Development Team deliver…  </p>

    <p>Without self-organisation how do we effectively encourage individuals to
    work as a team and be responsible for the results?<br />

    <h2>Encouraging self-organisation</h2>

    </p>

    <p>There are many thing that can impact your ability to get to
    self-organising teams. Here are a few items to ponder:</p>

    <ul>

    <li><b>Team Accountability</b> – Moving from Individual accountability for
    tasks, to collective accountability can improve both the team dynamics and
    the management of those teams. Peer-pressure within teams and a clear but
    slight pleasure to deliver can reduce any concerns around collective under
    performance.  </li>

    <li><b>Team Identity </b>– Although related to accountability, organisations
    wants to aspire to achieve high-performing teams which is impossible without
    a team identity. This identity is the same ideal that sports teams strive
    for and results in a camaraderie that is part of any high-achieving team.
    Team should be expected to move through <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development">Tuckman's
    stages of group development</a> (Forming | Storming | Norming |
    Performing).  </li>

    <li><b>Small Teams </b>– Creating dedicated teams of 6+-3 people will allow
    you to manage the complexity of the work and the people more effectively. A
    team should work from a single ordered backlog so that they get good at
    working together, understanding the backlog, and delivering. You may need
    multiple teams to work through the backlog at a rate that is acceptable to
    the customer but you should see significantly better results with many small
    teams than fewer large teams.  </li>

    <li><b>Consistent Teams</b> – If you are forever inter-changing team member
    then you will be forever re-forming and never even enter storming let alone
    getting to performing. If you cant get to performing then high-performing is
    totally out of reach. Stop thinking in individual allocation to projects and
    start thinking about team allocation to projects. This will also <a

    href="http://nkdagility.com/what-is-the-roll-of-the-project-manager-in-scrum/">help
    reduce your management overhead</a> and improve your communication by
    removing layers between the customer and the team. </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Remember that the biggest killer of self-organising teams is a manager
    who just needs to make sure…</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Without self-organisation, no matter how much we try, all we can ever
    have is a glorified collection on individuals that think and operate as
    individuals. Just like with sports teams we want to have those individuals
    identify as a team, to work together as a team and function as a team. The
    only way to achieve this is to have them <strong>be a team</strong>. You
    would not want the coach to swap out players on football game for every
    match? How effective would that be? So don’t do it to your teams…</p>

    <p>If you get really good at self-organising teams you may find your
    organisations formula to high-performing teams…</p>
