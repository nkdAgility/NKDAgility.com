However, it primarily focuses on course promotion rather than a deep exploration of competence as a foundational principle in Agile methodologies. The mention of consistent quality in training and the importance of a common understanding among team members aligns with the concept of competence, but the depth of discussion is limited and lacks a thorough examination of continuous learning or strategies for fostering a culture of competence.",
