Its how they are handled that is important.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/2.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;\" title=\"2\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"2\" width=\"548\" height=\"308\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><strong>Figure: I can view history on the missing file</strong></p>\n<p>If you find something like this then you need to contact the product team through <a href=\"http://tfspreview.com\">http://tfspreview.com</a>.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I escalated this to the Product Team and after a few questions and screenshots they investigated and identified a bug in VC subsystem which under certain circumstances can result in deleting files.\_ Here are the technical details:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A call to the Upload server call in Dev11 consists of three database calls. Version control is the orchestrator of the operation and it controls these three steps. Steps 1 and 3 are VC steps. Step 2 is owned by the file service.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pre-upload (prc_PreUploadFile) – checks to make sure the server item ($/…) for which the user is calling is eligible for upload (existence check, etc.)</li>\n<li>Upload – this phase is delegated to the file service. At the end of this call, the row in tbl_File is created and its OwnerId is set to 1.</li>\n<li>Post-upload (prc_PostUploadFile). The row for this item in tbl_PendingChange is modified to get the FileId for the row in tbl_File.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no overarching transaction for these three steps. If prc_DeleteUnusedContent runs between steps 2 and 3 above then it will garbage collect the file ID it just created because it appears the file ID is unrooted in VC.</p>\n<p>I applied a temporary mitigation to your account through which you should be able to access the file.\_ Can you please re-try accessing the file and let me know if you still are able to repro the issue now?</p>\n<p>We already ported a fix into RTM &amp; will be working on deploying a hotfix to the service on Friday or Monday.<br />-Madhu Kavikondala</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This had now been fixed not just for me, but across both the hosted service and for the TFS 2012 RTM <img class=\"wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile\" style=\"border-style: none;\" src=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/08/wlEmoticon-smile1.png\" alt=\"Smile\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Are you having problems with TFS Preview?

      You get a TF400898 when trying to get source code from TFS preview. It
      says that you can't get the file, when you can see it and the history.
