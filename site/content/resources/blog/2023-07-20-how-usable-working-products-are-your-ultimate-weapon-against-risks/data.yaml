    <p>It baffles me how some agile teams, who claim to be the pioneers of
    modernity, are living in archaic times where usable working products are as
    rare as unicorns! Just a heads-up, my dear agile practitioners: the linchpin
    of Agile is a Usable Working Product. Yes, you read it right!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>TL;DR;</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The only way to mitigate risk when employing Agile practices is by
    continuously delivering a usable working product. Agile is not about
    spinning the hamster wheels but delivering shippable increments that users
    can interact with. A fortress of documentation can’t protect you from the
    market’s ever-changing demands. Feedback loops, value delivery, and
    engineering excellence are your protection in agile product delivery.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Let’s get down to brass tacks.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Usable Working Product is Your Silver Bullet</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>When I say "usable working product," I mean a gleaming software increment
    that is free from known glitches and worthy of release. The agile realm is
    not a place for code maestros who build fanciful algorithms that never see
    the light of day. It’s about Developers who can craft a functional product
    that actual users can validate and provide feedback on.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>But wait! The naysayers will say, "What about documentation? Isn’t that
    important too?" Of course, documentation is vital, but let’s not build the
    Great Wall of China with it! Excessive documentation in Agile is like
    wearing a suit of armour to run a marathon – ridiculously cumbersome and
    defeating the purpose.</p>

    the Bugs FFS!</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Imagine a ship with a tiny hole in its hull. Ignore it, and soon you’ll
    find yourself in an unsolicited swimming lesson. Known errors or exceptions
    are those tiny holes. If you discover a bug, get your toolset out and patch
    it up. Too big? Bring it to the Product Owner’s attention and prioritise its
    fix. Having a “manage-the-bug” mentality is like welcoming water into the
    ship.</p>

    Your Vanguard Against Rework</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Do you know what’s better than finding and fixing bugs? Not having them
    in the first place! How, you ask? Continuous feedback loops. I cannot stress
    this enough – the more you engage with the stakeholders, the better you
    understand their requirements and expectations. Your code should dance to
    the tunes of the customer’s needs. Shorter feedback loops mean you are
    constantly in tune with what’s needed and can adapt before significant
    damage is done.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Constant rework of features because of a perceived bug or inconsistency
    from what’s needed creates significant waste for companies.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Indeed the data suggests that only 35%* of the features we build are
    actually of value to our customers.</p>

    id="h-manual-tests-the-antithesis-of-agility"><strong>Manual Tests – The
    Antithesis of Agility</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Manual tests in Agile are like trying to catch bullets with your teeth –
    utterly absurd and dangerous. This isn’t a magic show; it’s serious
    business. Automation is king in Agile. Embrace it, nurture it. Manual tests
    are not just time-consuming; they are the loophole that regression loves.
    Automation is the sensors that protect your product from unintended
    problems.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keep-it-lean-and-mean"><strong>Keep It
    Lean and Mean</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>It’s a battlefield out there. The markets are evolving faster than ever
    before. Your protection in this ruthless world is a lean, mean, and
    functional product. It’s not about delivering a magnum opus in one go; it’s
    about iterative development that aligns with the market demands. You need to
    be swift, adaptive and focused. Trim down the documentation, automate your
    processes, and concentrate on delivering a product ready to face the real
    world.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"
    id="h-conclusion-be-agile-truly"><strong>Conclusion: Be Agile,
    Truly</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>So create a usable working product on a regular cadence, close the
    feedback loops, and leverage as much automation as possible. Use
    documentation as part of your strategy but just enough to get buy.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Stay connected to the market and business demands and create a usable
    working product of the highest possible value!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This is the way!</p>
