Most Scrum Masters are incompetent ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Around [61% of those in-role don't have the skills and knowledge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/martinhinshelwood_scrummastery-agileleadership-continuousimprovement-activity-7203391160243892224-nVHP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) to truly lead.

I have met some, a scent few, that have the skills, knowledge, and experience to be true leaders. Most of these leaders have significant experience in the context of the teams, and can coach them in their work.

That means, if it's a software team, that they are coaching the team in modern engineering practices, and the product t owner in product management, as well as helping the organisation in enabling effective teams.

If you have a competent Scrum Master they add significant value... Have a great Scrum Master and your teams will shine.

I wrote a post on [Why Most Scrum Masters Are Failing and What They Should Know
]({{< relref "/resources/blog/2024/2024-09-05-the-incompetent-scrum-master-why-most-are-failing-and-what-they-should-know" >}}) recently and did a video on [The difference between a competent Scrum Master and a Jira Jockey]({{< relref "/resources/videos/youtube/txN41c6znbE" >}})! Totally opinion pieces, but I've trained over 2000 people in Scrum, and worked with over 200 companies on DevOps, and Agile... And by and large I see:

1. Most companies are not serious about agile or DevOps
2. Most companies don't respect the Scrum Master skillset and expect someone fresh out of collage to fulfill it.
3. Most individuals who take up a role as a Scrum Master have no respect for it or their organisation's needs for effectiveness.
4. Most individuals that become Scrum Masters don't have the skills, knowledge, or experience necessary to fulfill it.
5. Most dont have the authority to fulfill it if they wanted to.
