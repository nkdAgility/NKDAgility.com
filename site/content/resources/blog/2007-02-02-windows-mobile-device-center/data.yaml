  - "<p>Well, its about time: The WMDC is out of beta and is available to <a title=\"Windows Mobile Device Center Download\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devicecenter.mspx\">download</a>. WMDC is the replacement for ActiveSync on Vista and I would have expected it to be available for the business release of Vista. Up until now users have had to make do with the beta version that was originally released for Vista RC1, and I can tell you it was a little flaky in places. Not anything really problematic, just the usual beta unfinishedness, though it was usable.</p>\n<p>I was very happy to get my Windows Alert this morning from <a title=\"Windows Mobile Device Center\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2007/02/wmdc-rtm.html\">Daniel Moth's</a> blog to say that it was released and it was a painless procedure to get rid of the beta and install the RTM.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>Have fun... Unless you have Windows Mobile 2002 or below which is not supported...</p>\n<p>That's was you get for having a 4+ year old Pocket PC.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/WM6\" rel=\"tag\">WM6</a>\_</div>"
