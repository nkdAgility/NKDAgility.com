    development on the Tfs Automation Platform there is the need to do in-depth
    investigations into the way things are going to work.</p>  <blockquote>  
    <p>“Epic 1: As Dave or Gary I want WIQL queries to be automatically updated
    when I move from iteration to iteration+1 or sprint to sprint+1”</p>
    </blockquote>  <br clear="all" />  <h2>Updates (<font color="#9b00d3">in
    purple</font>)</h2>  <ul>   <li><strong>2011-06-10 - <a
    href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie Fourie</a></strong> –
    Although Mike called these out as “a few random thoughts” I think that they
    are still things that need answered around capacity planning and
    resilience.</li> </ul>  <p><span style="color: #ff0000"><em><span
    style="color: #ff0000"><em>note: This product is still under development and
    this document is subject to change. There is also the strong possibility
    that these are just rambling fantasies of a mad programmer with an architect
    complex.</em></span></em></span></p>  <hr />  <p>This story revolves around
    on of the most common iteration issues. When I progress from working on
    “[Team Project]R1Sprint 1” to working on “[Team Project]R1Sprint 2” I have
    to go through all of the queries that I created in the “Current Iteration”
    folder and update each of the Queries to reflect the new Sprint.</p>  <p><a

    width="580" height="550" /></a>     <br /><strong>Figure: All the “Current
    Sprint” queries need changed</strong></p>  <p>Although in this example there
    are only 6 queries I have worked with teams that have many many queries in
    this list. I have worked with still more teams that keep creating “Sprint
    [X]” folders and duplicating queries, but that tis another storey.</p> 
    <p>If there are many queries (15+) it may take more than a minute to edit
    them. That is enough time for a user doing this manually to get distracted
    and forget where they are in the list. Not good… on top of that this job is
    just plain boring and is what computers were made to do.</p>  <blockquote>  
    <p>Is it not possible to just run a sql script which does this?     <br
    />-<a href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie Fourie</a></p>
    </blockquote>  <p><font color="#9b00d3">Any use of SQL against the TFS
    Database would result in your TFS database being in an unserviceable state.
    Even the Integration Platform is not allowed to do any database work <img

    /></font></p>  <p>Enter the TFS Automation Platform and one of the core
    automations of the TFS Iteration Automation project. What we need is a
    “Change Iteration” option on the menu of Team Explorer…</p>  <p><a

    Iteration should be obvious and easy</strong></p>  <p>I can now only
    apologise for my diagrams <img style="border-bottom-style: none;

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2011/05/wlEmoticon-smile1.png" /> I
    am not the best drawer. There will likely be some sort of configuration
    screen where you can select options for enabling this Automation. For
    example, are you using Area’s as sub projects? If you are then a whole new
    dimension opens up for having multiple nested queries.</p>  <p>You would
    also need to be able to select, for each of your Projects (wither they be
    Team Projects or Area Projects) which folder to use as your “Current Sprint”
    folder so the system knows which queries to change.</p>  <p><a

    values for Current Iteration</strong></p>  <p>When the user selects the
    “Change” option the application will queue the
    TfsAutomation.Iteration.ChangeIterationJob on the TFS Job Service for
    execution. </p>  <blockquote>   <p>What sort of processing times are we
    looking at for these queued jobs to be executed?     <br />-<a
    href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie Fourie</a></p>
    </blockquote>  <p><font color="#9b00d3">I would expect the job to start
    almost instantly, but it would depend on the server load. I certainly would
    not expect this job to take any longer than a few seconds to run with
    minimal lag.</font></p>  <p>This will provide some level of resilience in
    case of the server being restarted during the process. </p>  <blockquote>  
    <p>Is this a realistic concern? I’m guessing our automation will run in &lt;
    10seconds. TFS uptime should be 99% + in organisations     <br />-<a
    href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie Fourie</a></p>
    </blockquote>  <p><font color="#9b00d3">Although it is not likely for this
    type of collision to happen for this to happen and for this automation it
    would not really matter, there will be other automation where it will. We
    need to be consistent in our deployment and implementation between
    Automations in order to be able to automatically deploy and manage
    effectively.</font></p>  <p>It will also provide an easy way to protect
    ourselves from 2 users trying to achieve the same task at the same time.
    </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Is this a realistic concern? Even in large
    organisations, how many people would (and have permission) to change the
    active iterations for example     <br />-<a
    href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie Fourie</a></p>
    </blockquote>  <p><font color="#9b00d3">Only likely to be “Project
    Administrator”, but if there were 1000 projects… So for this automation I
    agree, not likely, and how much of a big deal is it anyway. I can however
    imagine occupancies where is does matter.</font></p>  <p>We can check to see
    if the Job is already running before starting it and prevent another from
    starting.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>I fear over complexity here. What am I
    missing     <br />-<a href="http://mikefourie.wordpress.com/">Michael Ockie
    Fourie</a></p> </blockquote>  <p><font color="#9b00d3">This particular
    automation is a very short run thing, but there may be others that take much
    longer to run. I may want to add rollup to my process template, send emails
    to everyone that has something checked out for longer than 5 days or delete
    all workspaces that have not been accessed in 3 months. There are many
    things that could take time and the Platform needs to be considerate of
    that. </font></p>  <p>This process will be a welcome first addition to the
    TFS Automation Platform and it looks like it is going to exercise at least
    the UI, Configuration and TFS Job Service sections that we plan on
    building.</p>  <p>I am really looking forward to getting started on
    this…</p>

      I love the

      concept of a Tfs Automation Platform. Please let me know if I can help in
      any

      way.



      When

      connecting to the TFS Client API you can provide a set of keys and values
      that

      later can be used in the queries like:



      @me = My

      username



      @project =

      The current project



      Could you

      not add to that list so you can use @currentIteration in your query
      instead?

      I haven’t

      worked on extending Visual Studio yet but why is it not possible to do? Is
      VS

      not exposing that as an extension point?

      [...] How Might We Implement the Change Iteration Automation for the TFS
      Automation Platform from Martin Hinshelwood Probably the single most
      wanted feature in the TFS Automation Platform is the ability to automate
      the creation of new iterations and the associated queries and reports that
      go along with it. In this post, Martin investigates how this might be
      implemented. It’s also a good exploration into examining requirements and
      designing potential solutions.   This post authored by Trent Nix Read more
