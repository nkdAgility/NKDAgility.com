    "final_score": 18.0,
    "reasoning": "The content discusses Microsoft's Release Management tools (VSTS/TFS, circa 2015–2016), focusing on DevOps pipelines, flexible orchestration, and tool integration. While these are related to modern delivery and technical enablement, there is no discussion of agentic concepts: no mention of autonomous AI agents, context-aware intelligence, human–AI synergy, or deliberate integration of agents. The narrative centers on orchestration and flexibility but lacks emphasis on proactive, autonomous, or context-grounded intelligence. Given its age, the tooling and philosophy predate the 'Agentic Software Delivery' paradigm, resulting in penalties for outdated practices and lack of direct reference.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on legacy DevOps pipeline tools without reference to agentic AI, agency, or contextual intelligence. It has only tangential, partial alignment to the Agentic Software Delivery category, with limited relevance.",
    "level": "Ignored"
