    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the challenges of scaling Scrum and the need for professionalism, engineering best practices, and context-sensitive implementations. There is no mention or discussion of Service Level Expectation (SLE), neither explicitly nor conceptually, and no references to its definition, calculation, or application. Although the intended audience—Scrum practitioners or those interested in scaling Agile frameworks—could potentially overlap with those interested in SLE, the content itself does not address any SLE topics, and all discussion of process and delivery is generic or tied to other elements of Scrum. Thus, extremely low scores are assigned across all dimensions except for audience, which receives a correspondingly higher value since the topic may be of interest to practitioners in the SLE field.",
