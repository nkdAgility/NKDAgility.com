    As part of the Scrum.org webinar “Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer - Martin
    Hinshelwood - Answering Your Most Pressing Scrum Questions” I was asked a
    number of questions. Since not only was I on the spot and live, I thought
    that I should answer each question that was asked again here, as well as
    those questions I did not get to.


    In case you missed it, here is the recording of yesterday's Ask a
    Professional Scrum Trainer webinar with Martin Hinshelwood! Watch here: <a

    <blockquote><strong>&gt;&gt;I am interested to hear your perspective about
    collocation. There's a spectrum of opinions, it seems, from "Distributed
    teams and remote-only teams are the way of the future" to "The most
    effecient and effective method of communicating to and within the
    development team is face to face".

    My personal experiences and I suggest the vast majority of data indicate
    collocation is optimal. I'd go so far as to say that collocation is
    'empirically' best -- in particular if/when a team is suffering
    communication challenges. Yet The Scrum Guide(tm) doesn't take a definitive
    position on this issue.

    What's your position as a PST? What's your advice to
    teams?</strong></blockquote>

    Lets first define what collocation is:

    <blockquote>Collocation is a complimentary agile practice where all members
    of the same Scrum Team work on a daily basis in the same room, within visual
    sight of each other.

    -MrHinsh</blockquote>

    You may argue with my definition, but thats what I am going with and we
    should note that its a complimentary practice and not a core practice. That
    is, its not required to be agile or to do Scrum. However I believe that it
    is a very rare situation that would result in a distributed Scrum Team to
    become a high performing Scrum Team. I’m defiantly not saying that it cant
    happen, I have heard tell of highly efficient and value orientated Teams
    that were distributed. I just cant help but thing that is they were that
    awesome distributed, how much more amazing would their output have been if
    they had been collocated.


    While collocation is not required, it is highly recommended especially for
    new teams. The practice of sitting together, solving problems together, and
    supporting each other is something that humans need in their lives. Its
    important for our physiological and psychological wellbeing. We need to
    interact.


    You should <a

    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head over to Scott Hanselman blog
    and read about the plight of the remote worker</a> from someone whom has
    been able to leverage technology significantly. As you read I think you will
    see, as I did, that this is a lot of effort trying to mimic that personal
    interaction and physical presence. So while remote working is certainly a
    possibility, it requires the judicious use of right technology to make it
    work.


    Ultimately for small organisations with few developer's you may have no
    choice but to be remote, its not ideal, but we can make it work. I believe
    that ideally we should be collocated at least within the same Scrum Team. We
    can have a number of Scrum Teams that are not in the same location as long
    as the members of each Scrum Team are collocated.

    Microsoft has been studying the value of colocation and team rooms for quite
    some time and its interesting that they have been investing billions of
    dollars to remodel all of their engineering spaces into fully functional
    Team Rooms. Every team room is out of earshot of all the others, it has
    space for up to 12 team members, and has both a video conferencing room that
    can hold everyone, and two breakout rooms. These rooms are only for the team
    and are not bookable by anyone else.


    This type of space provides not only a level of Focus, but a level of self,
    of ownership, that is just not posible in a shared space. These teams fell
    like they are valued by the organisation, and feel empowered to take control
    of their own culture.


    Its clear from the data that collocation is best, but its just not always
    available based on company culture and how things are organised. If you are
    unable to be collocated then the role of the Scrum Master is to work to
    minimise the negative impact of the team while working on the organisational
    impediments that resulted in the problem in the first place. Hopefully we
    will all be working in team rooms in the future.


    While there are no right answers there are some answers that are better than
    others. For your given situation select the most right answer, and iteration
    to the best version of it.
