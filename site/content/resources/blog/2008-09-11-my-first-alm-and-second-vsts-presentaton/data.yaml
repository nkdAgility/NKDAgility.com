  - "<p>It seams as if they went well! The plan of under preparing and over delivering worked a treat... Because I know the topics the lack of a prepared script allowed me to concentrate more on emparting knowlage and less on keeping to a set of arbitrary notes the go to pot as soon as the first question is asked.<br /></p><p>Yes the presentations were a little disjointed, but the content was delivered without too much hesitation and none of the stage fright that mared my last presentation at MS... even with a laptop that had a mind of its own and kept backing through the slides as if it did not want me to go on...<br /></p><p>It helped that the Developer Platform guys are a lot less scary than the Application Developer Consultants ;)<br /></p><p> <strong>What's this \"Developer TS VSTS\" thing anyway?</strong><br /></p><p>Well, it has a lot more sales focus that I thought it did! This is not a bad thing, but I thought that there would be some development and problem solving in there, but it is more of a pre-sales technology consultancy role... I think that this could be a good move for me, and definatly suits my personality, but I would really miss the development...<br /></p><p>We will see, I should here by early next week...</p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/ALM\" rel=\"tag\">ALM</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"
