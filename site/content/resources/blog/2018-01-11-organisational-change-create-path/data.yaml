    <p>Other scaled agile frameworks employ a cookie-cutter approach to
    organisational agility. While I accept that they may have worked somewhere
    once, the likelihood that the same approach will work in your organisation
    is small. They were created to get a unique company from their existing
    state to their personal vision of where they wanted to be. To increase the
    likelihood of success you need a framework that guides you to change your
    organisation in an incremental and custom fashion towards your own vision.
    Cookie-cutter approaches will not work for you.</p>

    <h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If we accept that our path to agility is unique and will always differ
    from others we can leverage the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-agility-guide-to-evidence-based-change-using-scrum-to-transform-your-enterprise/">Agility
    Guide to Evidence-based Change</a> to help guide us to a greater degree of
    organisational and business agility. We can use the same ideas that have
    created so much product value with Scrum and leverage them to create
    organisational value as well.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Create your Organisational Change Backlog and Organisational Change Team
    and create your own path to agility. Then train everyone in your
    organisation and have them identify, as only those that do the work can, the
    impediments to value delivery that you have in your organisation.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <h2>Create your own path to Organisational Agility</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Every organisation, and indeed every department, is a little bit
    different and you need to tailor your approach to suit the culture that you
    have. A clear vision and an incremental drive is the starting point to enact
    improvements.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I have been working with a few companies in the last year to move them
    towards a greater realisation of their ALM and DevOps visions. In my world,
    DevOps is made up of your Processes, Practices, and Tools that you use to
    deliver on your products vision and achieve some amount of business agility.
    The greater degree of agility that your organisation can attain the larger
    the competitive advantage that you will have over your competitors. In
    today's marketplace, there is no room for inefficient and wasteful
    organisations that are slow to change. As long as you are building software
    that your business uses to make money this is indubitably true. It really
    does not matter if you are selling that software, or that software runs the
    warehouse that allows you to deliver goods to customers. You rely on the
    function and features of that software to do business.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The first step to creating a direction for improvement is to<a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-organisational-change-ghana-police-service/">
    create an organisational improvement vision</a>. Think about where you would
    like to be and write it down. And donâ€™t just think of the short or medium
    term, this will be a living vision of your end goal. Try to think of the
    'whats' and 'whys' that you want to achieve rather than the 'hows'. You want
    to set direction and not constrain the ingenuity of those working towards
    the vision. This vision then needs to be communicated to everyone in your
    organisation. Everyone needs to understand that you stand behind that vision
    and plan to enact it.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"The greatest resistance to moving
    towards the culture and process that you want is the culture and process
    that you have"</p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>You also need to communicate, and often accept, that it takes time to
    change. Especially in Enterprise where the greatest resistance to moving
    towards the culture and process that you want is the culture and process
    that you have. Indeed if you are being truly iterative in achieving your
    vision the route to get there will likely change many times as your
    organisational culture adapts to the changes. The time it takes to reach
    your vision is directly related to the amount of support that you get in
    pursuing it. Bottom-up support is not all that is required to enact the type
    of organisational change that reaching towards business agility needs. You
    need full executive buy-in for the initiative and not just the usual lip
    service. They need to act in the change process, after all, it's their
    company and if they are not interested in being more efficient and beating
    competitors then why should you?</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you get that top-down involvement you can often accelerate the move to
    a greater degree of business agility by short-circuiting some of the usual
    resistance. Public buy-in at every level removes a lot of the vision
    backchat that often accompanies chaotic change.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Scrum is proven to deliver twice the
    features in half the time"<br />-Jeff Sutherland, <a
    href="http://nkdalm.net/Scrum-TwiceTheWork" target="_blank" rel="noopener

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Now that we have our vision we need to be able to enact it. Time and
    again Scrum has proven, worldwide and consistently, to deliver on the 'twice
    the features in half the time', promise and it can be used not only for
    delivering a product but also for delivering change within your
    organisation.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image"><img

    alt="image" title="image"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In order to enact our vision, we need a continuous improvement cycle
    where we:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

    <ol><li>measure the organisational value that we are getting using common
    metrics that we may need to tailor to our organisation</li><li>diagnose our
    organisation's capability and determine areas for
    improvement</li><li>Improve based on the direct evidence combined with the
    organisational capability</li></ol>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This process allows us to create an organisational improvement backlog
    while leaving room to change dynamically as we create more organisational
    value. We can easily switch focus to other areas that will provide more
    value for less investment. You should focus only on your first few steps
    towards your vision to maintain your ability to change for as long as
    possible.</p>

    <h2>The Organisational Change Team - the guiding coalition</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:html -->

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">

    <p>At this point you should read the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-agility-guide-to-evidence-based-change-using-scrum-to-transform-your-enterprise/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agility Guide for Evidence-based
    Change&nbsp;</a>if you have not already as an understanding of the concepts
    in this document is necessary to understanding this approach. You need to
    understand that your engineering practices will need to keep pace with your
    cultural and process changes. You can't leave any of these three pillars to
    lag or your pace of change will slow and may stall.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- /wp:html -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Key to moving forward at a sustainable and consistent pace is a guiding
    coalition that comprises senior representatives of engineering,
    commercialisation, and portfolio groups. This guiding coalition is the
    Change Team that will work through the organisational change backlog. You
    organisational change backlog should reflect the difference between where
    you are now and the vision that you want to achieve and the guiding
    coalition would be responsible for working through that backlog and showing
    improvements within the organisation to the change owner. These roles and
    accountabilities, just like for a Scrum Team, are key to being
    successful.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:html -->

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">

    <p><strong>Guiding Coalition -&nbsp;</strong>The group of people that are
    going to take your organisation forward and enact the change.</p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Change Owner</strong>: The individual who is accountable and
    responsible for the Organisational Change Backlog. Might be the CEO or
    senior Product Owner.</li>

    <li><strong>Change Team</strong>: The Team responsible for delivering
    against the Organisational Change Backlog. This team should have everyone
    they need to activate the items that they take on.</li>

    <li><strong>Process Manager</strong>: The person responsible for making sure
    that everyone is effective within the bounds of the framework.</li>

    </ul>

    </div>

    <!-- /wp:html -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If your organisation is large then we may want to break our guiding
    coalition along the lines of the below Practice Domains and have a separate
    and relevant guiding collision that is accountable for that domain and for
    working together with the other domains to achieve the vision.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image1.png"
    alt="image" title="image"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>When you have a large enterprise or even just a large part of that
    enterprise, it is essential to make sure that you make progress in each of
    the practice domain identified above. Sometimes that will mean that you need
    to have a separate and focused guiding coalition for each of the diagnostic
    practice domains. This will enable progress, in parallel, across each of the
    disciplines.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><strong>Process</strong> - Process is typically owned by your Scrum
    Masters which may be part of your traditional PMO and should contain all of
    the key drivers for implementing the Scrum framework with your
    teams.</li><li><strong>Productivity</strong> - Your engineering teams would
    be the most relevant and effective members of this
    domain.</li><li><strong>Value</strong> - Value is a key factor of your
    Product Owners and as such their organisation should be the leading members
    of this guiding coalition.</li><li><strong>Quality</strong> - Your
    commercialisation teams may be a key participant here, and with engineering
    practices high on the list of activities involvement from engineering would
    also make sense.</li><li><strong>Enterprise</strong> - This domain should be
    owned by your leadership and sales teams. This is where you focus on the
    high-level organisational culture shifts that need to happen.</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The ideas above for membership and accountability of the domains is by no
    means strict and should just be taken as a suggestion. In this process, we
    are accepting that every organisation is different and we will need to adapt
    the way we implement this organisational change framework to suit.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Each of the organisational change teams would be accountable and
    responsible for the delivery of measurable improvements to your organisation
    on a monthly cadence. While it may seem insurmountable it's about scale and
    focus. Break those large changes down into things that are achievable and
    show valuable improvements. The change backlog will help us focus on, and
    monitor, the pace of improvements.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>As we move towards our vision, after each step, we may need to improve,
    refactor, or completely redo our organisational change backlog as necessary
    to maximise achievable organisational value. Another practice that helps
    with this is communities of practice. Having an organised group of engineers
    share their knowledge across your teams will help each team assimilate the
    changes and improve their engineering practices in step with the changes. If
    you give dedicated time to these communities you should see a marked
    improvement in everyone's knowledge and skills.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2>Avoid sabotage and train all your stakeholders</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>You should not underestimate the ability of the uneducated members of
    your organisation, at whatever level, to undermine and often derail the
    change process. All of your employees are your <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/stakeholders/">stakeholders</a>
    to any organisational change, and it's hard to do anything without the
    support of your <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/stakeholders/">stakeholders</a>.
    On top of this one of your greatest challenges will be making sure that your
    message, and the agile message, does not get diluted with every telling.
    While at the executive level there may be a keen understanding of agile and
    lean and how to implement them the reality is that the further away the
    message must pass the less likely the message is to remain intact. Think of
    something as simple as the telephone game; how easily can the message get
    distorted. Then think of how complex your message of change is.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you have a core message, like Scrum, that you can have told the same
    worldwide you can cut through the human need to change the message to one
    they want to hear. So instead of focusing on posters and booklets, it is far
    more valuable to spend time in workshops all learning the same thing.
    Especially if you can get a wide variety of people into those classes.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The most effective agile transformations I have encountered have all got
    consistent and broad-based training in common. Wither you train with an
    internally created course or through professional training there is value in
    everyone having the same understanding of the agile principals and the Scrum
    framework. When I have done this for organisations it has visibly empowered
    and exited the folks that work there and kick-started the move towards
    agility. That is why the Professional Scrum Foundations class was created,
    for brawed training at all levels throughout the organization. I have had
    everyone from the guy that drives the forklift in the warehouse, to the CEO
    of the company in the same room, working on teams to deliver working
    software. The understanding of empiricism and the complexity of software
    development that this provides is invaluable for getting folks moving in the
    right direction.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2>Get your stakeholders to create Organisational Change Backlog Items</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The other outcome of the Professional Scrum Foundations class is as a
    feeder into the organisational change backlog. Who better than the people
    that are actually doing the work, at all levels, and who have just learned
    about Scrum, to create Backlog Items? With the learnings of Scrum fresh in
    their mind, they are eminently perfect for identifying the Impediments in
    your current organisation to moving towards the new model. The last few
    hours of the class is dedicated to a workshop that gets all of your <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/stakeholders/">stakeholders</a>
    thinking about what needs to change to move to the new way.</p>

    <p>How do you create Backlog Items for your Organisational Change Backlog
    when every employee is a stakeholder?</p>
