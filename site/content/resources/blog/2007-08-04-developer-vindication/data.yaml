  - "<p>The biggest vindication of your .Net\_developer status would be if Microsoft wanted to employ you! And it happened to me...</p>\n<p>I recently blogged about maybe being <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx\">interested in a career change</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/sbhatia/default.aspx\">Siddharth Bhatia</a>, a Group Program Manager from Microsoft posted a <a title=\"Siddharth Bhatia comment\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blog.martin.hinshelwood.com/archive/2007/07/16/Its-that-time-again.aspx#138860\">comment</a> asking to get in touch.</p>\n<p>We had a lengthy conversation that ended in him asking if I would be interested in a position in Redmond. I should note that he did not at any time offer me a position as\_there is a lengthy process at Microsoft to get to that stage.</p>\n<p>Obviously I said yes and he got one of his development managers, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/04B/946\">Scot Gellock</a>, to email me and go through the preliminary's. This is where we ran into a problem...a Visa problem.</p>\n<p>As I understand it, I would require a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1B_visa\">H1B</a> vista to work in the US. These are in limited supply, start only on 1st September and it it too late to apply...</p>\n<p>I am not giving up on this, but there are few other options...</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"
