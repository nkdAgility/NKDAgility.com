There is a new release of the Power Tools for team system. As an MVP I was involved in the trial that started early this month, and I can tell you that a LOT of work has gone into these :)

[Willy-Peter Schaub's](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/default.aspx) has [posted](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/archive/2008/11/09/visual-studio-team-system-2008-team-foundation-server-power-tools-october-2008-release.aspx) about them and I don’t see as I need to add to his detailed [post](http://dotnet.org.za/willy/archive/2008/11/09/visual-studio-team-system-2008-team-foundation-server-power-tools-october-2008-release.aspx)…
