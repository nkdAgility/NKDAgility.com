Well we have been having a few problems with the [GDR](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/08/20/vstsdb-2008-gdr-ctp16-is-here.aspx). Essentially when we import our database it complains about dependencies.

We have many stored procedures that call stored procedures that call stored procedures! This seams to give the GDR fits. Maybe we are doing something that we are not supposed to, but SQL does not complain.

I tried uninstalling the GDR, but that left me with NO data dude :(

SO I have reinstalled and will try again....
