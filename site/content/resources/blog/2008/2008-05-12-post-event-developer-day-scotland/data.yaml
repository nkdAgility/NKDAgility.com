  - "<p>What a fantastic day... Thanks to <a href=\"http://blog.colinmackay.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Mackay</a> for the fantastic job he did organising this event and I hope that there will be more events like this in Glasgow in the future...</p>  <p>I can only comment on the speakers that I attended, but they were all very impressive...</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.guysmithferrier.com/details.aspx?Entry=221\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Smith-Ferrier</a> did an excellent presentation on <a href=\"http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Speakers/tabid/56/Default.aspx#Guy_Smith_Ferrier\" target=\"_blank\">ADO.NET Data Services</a> which I now understand and see the benefits and applications of, thanks Guy. And <a href=\"http://www.benlamb.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Lamb</a> did an interesting session on \"Anti-Patterns\" that left me thinking a lot about code I had written in the past, you can find his presentation on his <a href=\"http://www.benlamb.com\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a>...</p>  <p>After lunch when you normally start to fall asleep we got a session on Continuous integration from <a href=\"http://blogs.blackmarble.co.uk/blogs/rfennell/archive/2008/05/11/developer-day-scotland.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Fennell</a> that sparked my interest (more on team system Richard). Then came the speaker that probably had the most impact for me. The talk was entitled \"Red, Green, Refactor!\" and was all about \"Test Driven Development\" from a guy that seams to know much about the subject, <a href=\"http://blog.benhall.me.uk/2008/05/developer-day-scotland-post-conference.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Hall</a>.</p>  <p>If I took anything away from this day, it was that although I know a lot, I know very little....</p>  <p>\_</p>  <p>\_</p>  <div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      Your last line is very true. No matter how much new stuff I learn each
      year, I always find that I know less. Technology is moving along so fast
      that it is very difficult to keep up.<br /><br />I'm glad you had a good
      day. I'm still recovering. :)
