In my recent troubles with [branching and merging](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/10/22/branch-madness.aspx) I found (it was not lost, I just did not know about it) a fantastic tool, that has actually been part of the [power tools for about two years](http://www.bdharry.members.winisp.net/BlogImages/NewTFSPowerToysAvailable_8214/treediff3.jpg), for comparing two branches. Cool…
