I currently have the task of setting up SharePoint Portal for my company. But here is the kicker, they have users in almost every country in the world, so how to structure the deployment.

I knew roughly how to do this, but a post by [Jose Barreto](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/) entitled "[The Legend of the Single, Multi-Terabyte, Replicating SharePoint Database](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2007/10/25/the-legend-of-the-single-multi-terabyte-replicating-sharepoint-database.aspx)" that really caught my eye. I knew that this was how it worked, but I did not actually know! if you take my meaning. This post spreads light on the Architecture of a SharePoint deployment across multiple continents.

I have found many of his [posts](http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/tags/sharepoint/default.aspx) to be invaluable in my SharePoint planning and you should have a look if you are doing the same...
