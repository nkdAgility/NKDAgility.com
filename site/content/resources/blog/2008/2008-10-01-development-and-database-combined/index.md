[Microsoft has just announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/09/29/team-developer-team-data-team-developer.aspx) that the two products, Visual Studio Team Edition for Database Developers and Visual Studio Team Edition for Developers as been combined.

From today if you Own either version in 2005 or 2008 flavours you will also have access to the other.

Good stuff :)
