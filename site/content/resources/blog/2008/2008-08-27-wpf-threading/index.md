I was having a problem getting multi threading working with the ObservableCollection, and struggled to find a solution. So I asked my friend Google and after a while it directed me to [Kevin's](http://blog.quantumbitdesigns.com/) blog and specifically to his post on [WPF Cross-Thread Collection Binding - Part 4 - The Grand Solution](http://blog.quantumbitdesigns.com/2008/07/22/wpf-cross-thread-collection-binding-part-4-the-grand-solution/).

This is a fantastic article, that provided me with the exact solution I was looking for, so I perused his other articles and found many tips on Multi-Threading....

One to watch...
