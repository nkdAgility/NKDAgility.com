    I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of interest in the <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/02/05/tfs-sticky-buddy-codeplex-project.aspx"
    target="_blank">Sticky Buddy project</a>. I was particularly exited when
    Siddharth Bhatia contacted me, but disappointed that he could not get the
    proof of concept versions to work.


    Well, hopefully that is about to change with the addition of <a
    href="http://manicprogrammer.com/cs/blogs/willeke/default.aspx"
    target="_blank">Eric Willeke</a> to the development team. if you have been
    following the project you will see that he has been a avid tester from the
    beginning and I would like to welcome him fully on board for the next leg of
    the project...


    Eric, I hope you are good a deciphering convoluted and complicated code that
    at times borders on the nasty!
