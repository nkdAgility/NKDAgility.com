I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of interest in the [Sticky Buddy project](http://blog.hinshelwood.com/archive/2008/02/05/tfs-sticky-buddy-codeplex-project.aspx). I was particularly exited when Siddharth Bhatia contacted me, but disappointed that he could not get the proof of concept versions to work.

Well, hopefully that is about to change with the addition of [Eric Willeke](http://manicprogrammer.com/cs/blogs/willeke/default.aspx) to the development team. if you have been following the project you will see that he has been a avid tester from the beginning and I would like to welcome him fully on board for the next leg of the project...

Eric, I hope you are good a deciphering convoluted and complicated code that at times borders on the nasty!
