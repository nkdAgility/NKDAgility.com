If you are wanting to developer solutions for SharePoint in Visual Studio 2008 then you need a couple of things to get started:

- **You will need to install VSeWSS 1.1.
  **[http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/sharepoint/archive/2008/02/11/announcing-the-final-release-of-vsewss-1-1-and-the-upcoming-version-1-2.aspx")
- Then follow the instructions on [Martin Vollmer\`s Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/default.aspx)  in his post on getting it installed without Sharepoint.  
   [http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/03/19/new-registry-file-for-developing-moss2007-projects-in-a-workstation-xp-or-vista.aspx")
- And to get workflow working you need to again follow the instructions on [Martin Vollmer\`s Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/default.aspx)  in his post on getting the workflow dll's out of the server.  
   [http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx "http://blogs.msdn.com/martinv/archive/2008/01/21/developing-custom-moss-2007-sharepoint-workflows-on-a-remote-workstation.aspx")

Although this is convoluted it does work...

If you are developing for either of my MOSS Codeplex Projects ([MOSS Time Off Management](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSTOM) or [MOSS Designer Workflow Activities](http://www.codeplex.com/MOSSActivities)) then you will need this up and running if you do not want to have to install everything on a SharePoint server...

**UPDATE: If you can get this to work, you must be a SharePoint developer guru**
