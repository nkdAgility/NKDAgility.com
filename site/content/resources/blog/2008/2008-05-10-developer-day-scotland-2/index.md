**[Developer Day Scotland - 10th May 2008](http://developerdayscotland.com)**

If you have not already signed up, well, its probably too late...but if you are still up and you are in Glasgow tomorrow get yourself down to [Glasgow Caledonian University](http://www.gcal.ac.uk/) (I went to University there) and drop in. Don't forget to sign up tonight...

If you are up for it there is a [Developer Day Scotland Geek Dinner](http://www.zimakki.com/wiki/DeveloperDayScotlandGeekDinner.ashx) on afterwards and some drinking before that.
