As I now have a [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") server in the office and we have  Go-Live on 1st February I will be revisiting the TFS Event Handler prototype. I think there is too much work in the main code to get it working, but I should be able to rework the Prototype for Visual Studio 2008 and Team Foundation Server 2008.

Hopefully this will not be much work...

Well, I was wrong... Looks like some language compatibility problems...
