Over the next few weeks I will be blogging my escapades in developing an application solution for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. I have entitled the application "_MOSS Time Off Management_" and it will be up on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") for all to follow @ [http://www.codeplex.com/mosstom](http://www.codeplex.com/mosstom) (coming soon).

The idea behind this application is twofold:

First to give me a project that I can get my teeth into to learn all of the ins and outs of the SharePoint model, including how one debugs and developers for it. And second to give my company a working system at the end... There is nothing like dogfooding and everyone should eat what they make.

It will be build in .NET 3.5 and use a combination of WebParts, Workflow, InfoPath, SQL Server and a few other assorted munchies. I will be trying to include Test Driven Devolvement (but that will be determined by SharePoint) and I will be building the installer first.

Although this application will not stand alone (although I may have to build a skeleton if SharePoint becomes a pain), it will be able to be deployed globaly on many servers (SharePoint farms) around the world with a single point of truth...

Now I am scared....
