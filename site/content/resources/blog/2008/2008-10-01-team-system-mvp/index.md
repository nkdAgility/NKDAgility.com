Well, I have just joined the auspicious ranks of [Team System MVP’s](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/communities/mvp.aspx?product=1&competency=Team+System), now numbering 73 worldwide. You can see [my profile](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Martin.Hinshelwood) on the MVP site. My name will now appear along side [Mitch Denny](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=2975269C-7D9E-46AE-A9DF-3E410887F30E) and [Tiago Pascoal](https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile=1874DC2D-2365-499A-8BD5-BF2D4702F340). Wow… I have a lot to aspire to…

I should really thank Tiago Pascoal as I have a sneaky suspicion that he was the one that nominated me :) Thanks Tiago…

This Award needs to be renewed yearly, so there is much work to do…
