I have been having a lot of Kerberos double hop problems on the network at work, and although I have not yet managed to fix them... I did find these useful pages:

[What Is Kerberos Authentication?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/792ed95d-6f13-4181-a218-e4eaab361c1b1033.mspx?mfr=true) - Good high level overview...

[Troubleshooting Kerberos Delegation](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/security/tkerbdel.mspx) - which I think I may find the most useful...

I will keep you updated on my progress...
