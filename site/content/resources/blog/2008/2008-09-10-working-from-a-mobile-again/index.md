As I am traveling today and I am not taking a laptop, I want to be able to do a little personal work from my mobile..

What I would realy like is to be able to monitor and edit my [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com "CodePlex") (Team Foundation Server) work items from my phone! And I am not talking about some crappy web based solution, I hate not being able to work offline, but a Smart Client application like the one I am using now (Diarist 2) that can let me work away with cached work items and then sync later!

If only the [TFS](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/teamsystem/aa718934.aspx "Team Foundation Server") API, excellent though it is, could be used without the need for Team Explorer to be installed.
