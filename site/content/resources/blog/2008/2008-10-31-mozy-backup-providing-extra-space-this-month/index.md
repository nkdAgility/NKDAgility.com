Until the 30th of November 2008 [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) are increasing the amount of space you get for referring a friend from 256mb to 512mb!

This is excellent and everyone should have some sort of [backup](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) :) as long as you click my [referral link](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) and use [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG)…

Really, [Mozy](http://mozy.com/?ref=8R96AG) is a good backup solution and I have been using it for my family and me for a good wee while. In fact, with 2gb for free, if anyone asks me to setup their computer (“No I will not fix yours!”) then I always add it as it makes it way easier to reload from a crash…
