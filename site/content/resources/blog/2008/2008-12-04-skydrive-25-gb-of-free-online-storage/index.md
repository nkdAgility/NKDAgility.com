Some of the new Windows Live Wave 3 services have gone live over the last couple of days. One of the best IMO is the [SkyDrive services](http://skydrive.live.com), updated to 25GB and with complete integration with other services like [Photo Share](http://photos.live.com), [Connect to people](http://profile.live.com/connect)…

A nice feature is the ability to link your live accounts so you can easily switch from your clever \[yourname\]@\[yourdomain\].com to your nasty \[yourname\]@live.com address.

As you can see from the menu structure, all of your services are all in one place, although some of those other services, OneCare for example, have not yet been updated as you can’t get back into the same bits… I am sure it will come…

The SkyDrive service has had a major overall and has a nice new home page as well as the integration with Live Photo and a whopping 25gb of space…
