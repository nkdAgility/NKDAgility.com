  - "<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com\">Community Credit</a> is getting a face lift and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/default.aspx\">David Silverlight</a> (yes a man so great that an entire platform was named after him) is asking for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx\">contributions</a> to this... So head on over to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx\">community credit forum</a> and get suggesting...</p>\n<p>My Suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4315/ShowThread.aspx#4315\">The ability to have blog posts submitted into a specific category, or moved to that category.</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>You should be able to change the category from an automatically submitted contribution. </p>\n        <p>This should be possible in two ways... </p>\n        <p>1. manually: users should be able to login and change the status of an automatically submitted entry. If they change it, it would require moderation... </p>\n        <p>2. tagging: users can add tags to their posts that could automate the above process. CC would parse the page and extract the tag and change the category. </p>\n        <p>I think that the first option is required, but the second is optional....</p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4316/ShowThread.aspx#4316\">Profile page uses username and not email address...</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>We don't want spammers getting to our email addresses... </p>\n        <p>Username should be used whenever displaying user data, that way our email addresses will not be visible...</p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4318/ShowThread.aspx#4318\">All profiles should be listed.</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>It is not possible to Google for your profile and this should be possible. My profile does come up, but I created a mapped URL and put it on my blog. </p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4319/ShowThread.aspx#4319\">Search engine optimisation / Faster load times for pages.</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>I think these two go hand in hand. They pages for the site should be lighter on graphics and that should make them load quicker. If a little though was put towards SEO then more people would find the pages, especially the profiles within the site.. Any page that comes up would push traffic to the site... </p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4320/ShowThread.aspx#4320\">Points for moderating Credits</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>If, like me, you are a moderator for credits (not the discussion boards) then there should be a points system for it. it should be based on how much work is involved in moderating the submission. </p>\n        <p>Maybe a good way would be to give the moderator 10% of the points awarded to the user <img alt=\"Smile\" src=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-1.gif\" />. This would certainly make me happy. </p>\n        <p>Articles are especially difficult to moderate as you need to search the web for similar titles and correlate dates.</p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4321/ShowThread.aspx#4321\">Guest developers</a>\n    <ul>\n        <p>It should be possible to drive traffic to the forums and encourage users to use them if you have guest developers for topics. </p>\n        <p>This would have a specific person with a specific skills moderating and answering forum posts on a specific topic. That developer would get extra points for being a Guest Developer and all his/her posts marked as \"Expert answers\". </p>\n        <p>This will provide developers with a sense of Ownership of the forums without having to have everyone as a moderator all of the time. the \"Guest Developer\" feature should be limited to a specific forum for a specific time.</p>\n    </ul>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>That's all I can think of just now, but I may be back <img alt=\"smile_regular\" src=\"http://spaces.live.com/rte/emoticons/smile_regular.gif\" />\_</p>\n<p><font color=\"#ff0000\"><strong>If you have any comments on these topics can you please use the title links to get to the forum and post them there...</strong></font></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Silverlight\" rel=\"tag\">Silverlight</a>\_</div>"
