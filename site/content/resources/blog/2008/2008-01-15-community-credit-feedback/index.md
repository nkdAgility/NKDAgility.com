[Community Credit](http://www.community-credit.com) is getting a face lift and [David Silverlight](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/blogs/default.aspx) (yes a man so great that an entire platform was named after him) is asking for [contributions](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) to this... So head on over to the [community credit forum](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/107/ShowForum.aspx) and get suggesting...

My Suggestions:

- [The ability to have blog posts submitted into a specific category, or moved to that category.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4315/ShowThread.aspx#4315)
  You should be able to change the category from an automatically submitted contribution.
  This should be possible in two ways...
  1\. manually: users should be able to login and change the status of an automatically submitted entry. If they change it, it would require moderation...
  2\. tagging: users can add tags to their posts that could automate the above process. CC would parse the page and extract the tag and change the category.
  I think that the first option is required, but the second is optional....
- [Profile page uses username and not email address...](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4316/ShowThread.aspx#4316)
  We don't want spammers getting to our email addresses...
  Username should be used whenever displaying user data, that way our email addresses will not be visible...
- [All profiles should be listed.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4318/ShowThread.aspx#4318)
  It is not possible to Google for your profile and this should be possible. My profile does come up, but I created a mapped URL and put it on my blog.
- [Search engine optimisation / Faster load times for pages.](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4319/ShowThread.aspx#4319)
  I think these two go hand in hand. They pages for the site should be lighter on graphics and that should make them load quicker. If a little though was put towards SEO then more people would find the pages, especially the profiles within the site.. Any page that comes up would push traffic to the site...
- [Points for moderating Credits](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4320/ShowThread.aspx#4320)
      If, like me, you are a moderator for credits (not the discussion boards) then there should be a points system for it. it should be based on how much work is involved in moderating the submission.

      Maybe a good way would be to give the moderator 10% of the points awarded to the user ![Smile](images/emotion-1.gif). This would certainly make me happy.

      Articles are especially difficult to moderate as you need to search the web for similar titles and correlate dates.
- [Guest developers](http://www.community-credit.com/cs/forums/4321/ShowThread.aspx#4321)
  It should be possible to drive traffic to the forums and encourage users to use them if you have guest developers for topics.
  This would have a specific person with a specific skills moderating and answering forum posts on a specific topic. That developer would get extra points for being a Guest Developer and all his/her posts marked as "Expert answers".
  This will provide developers with a sense of Ownership of the forums without having to have everyone as a moderator all of the time. the "Guest Developer" feature should be limited to a specific forum for a specific time.

That's all I can think of just now, but I may be back ![smile_regular](images/smile_regular-2-2.gif)
