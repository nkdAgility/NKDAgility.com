Or anywhere you can put some HTML. This is really easy and allows you to have something like:

[![Martin Hinshelwood's Twitter](images/Hinshelm.1-1-1.gif)](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Twitter/Hinshelm/~6/1)
{ .post-img }

As Twitter publish your twit list as an RSS feed you can just add it to FeedBurner and use one of its tools to create the above image.

So easy it hurts...
