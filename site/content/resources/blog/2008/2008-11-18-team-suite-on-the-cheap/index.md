Ok, so I lied a little. It is not that cheap, but 30% off an upgrade from a team edition to full Team Suit is nothing to be sniffed at, it could be as much as £1000 off!

> If your team is using any component edition of Visual Studio Team System 2008 (Development Edition, Test Edition, Architecture Edition, or Database Edition), now’s the time to get more out of your development solution. Step up to the complete Visual Studio Team System 2008 Team Suite, and save 30%. That’s a huge savings to give your development team the full suite of tools - and help them collaborate better than ever during the entire application lifecycle.
