I have used the source code from the Family.Show project to create functionality and a look that is appealing.

You can download it from the [Codeplex site](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy) and you can raise bugs with the [issue tracker](http://www.codeplex.com/TFSStickyBuddy/WorkItem/List.aspx)...

Please remember that this is a CTP and is not fully functional. With this version you can see how your Areas and Iterations tree diagrammatically. I intend to display the work items within the body of the node and display a different view depending on the zoom level...

I have yet to skin the whole application so you will see some bitts that look exactly like the [Family.Show](http://www.vertigo.com/familyshow.aspx) application from [Vertigo](http://www.vertigo.com)... yes I know.. I am a lazy developer...
