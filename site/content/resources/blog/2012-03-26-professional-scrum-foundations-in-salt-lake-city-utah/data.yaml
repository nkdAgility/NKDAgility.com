    <p>This week I have been filling in for <a
    href="http://elegantcode.com/author/dstarr/">David Starr </a>at a customer
    and it has been an experience. David had a family emergency and tapped me of
    all people to take the gig from him. So not only did <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com">Northwest Cadence </a>have to rearrange
    my schedule to make sure that I could do this, but I had to brave Salt Lake
    City and Utah…</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image14.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:

    alt="image" width="640" height="330" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    Warm sunny Park City, Utah</strong></p>

    <p>Little did I realise that the Big Yin (Mr Starr) had a few surprises for
    me. The first surprise was that this was a team of Java developers and that
    I would be leading an <a title="Agile Engineering Practices Workshop"
    href="http://elegantcode.com/author/dstarr/">Agile Engineering Practices
    Workshop</a> as part of the engagement. But that was not all…no, David left
    the best one until I was well and truly committed…</p>

    <p>I knew that I would have to spin up on the <a title="Professional Scrum
    Foundations (PSF)" href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/">Professional
    Scrum Foundations course</a> but that was just a mater of course, but the
    real sledge hammer came in the form of 68 students… um…no, that is not a
    type, it was 68 students over two runs of the two day course. Phew, but this
    is going to be fun…</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image15.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:
    inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="image"
    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image_thumb15.png"
    alt="image" width="640" height="327" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    32 people make a crowded room</strong></p>

    <p>I had not taught the <a title="Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF)"
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/">Professional Scrum Foundations
    (PSF)</a> course from Scrum.org before but David did a walkthrough at the
    last Face-2-Face and I had spun up on the course before. I was really
    excited as I think that this is a fantastic course. I had only the
    beginnings of an understanding of how good this course is before I taught
    it, but now this is the <a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/training/"
    target="_blank">one course I would recommend</a> for any agile or Scrum
    adoption.</p>

    <p>It is by far the most well thought out course that it has been my
    pleasure to teach. It may just have been the awesome students, but I think
    that David has excelled himself here and whomever gets custodianship of the
    course next has large boots to fill.</p>

    <p>On of the main goals of this course is to give teams practical knowledge
    of what they can achieve when they work as a team using Scrum. Thus there is
    a backlog of work that we actually ask students to work though and produce
    product by the end.</p>

    <p>They initially don’t think that they can build anything in 30 minutes,
    but as they go through the sprints they suddenly find that not only can they
    build something in 30 minutes, but that if they work together they can do
    anything. I don’t tell them anything about “how” I want them to complete the
    backlog and I leave them to figure it out.</p>

    <p><a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/SNAGHTMLdb0235.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:
    inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="SNAGHTMLdb0235"

    /><strong>Figure: What can you build in four 30 minute Sprints?</strong></p>

    <p>At first all but one team was building a home grown solution and finding
    difficulty in dealing with the bottleneck of having one or two programmers
    to a team. By the end of the second Sprint all but one team were using
    Wordpress… Why?</p>

    <p><strong>The power of the Review &amp; Retrospective!</strong></p>

    <p>Some of the power in these events is the understanding and cross
    pollination of good ideas. If you hear about a good experience that another
    team has encountered then you are likely to at least consider replicating
    it. Conversely, if you hear about a Sprint peppered by pain and suffering
    you are likely to want to know what not to try and do!</p>

    /><strong>Figure: Don’t be a Jackass</strong></p>

    <p>So, don’t be a jackass and learn not just from your own mistakes, but the
    shared mistakes of your organisation.</p>

    <p>All in I think I had 13 teams so you can imagine the differences of
    skills and knowledge that were involved. Some teams has Scrum boards.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image16.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image_thumb16.png"
    alt="image" width="640" height="352" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    The wonderful board of Team Jack@$$</strong></p>

    <p>Some teams stood up during their Daily Scrum.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image17.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:

    alt="image" width="640" height="344" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    One team decided to Stand up during the Daily Scrum</strong></p>

    <p>Other teams were always asking the Product Owner for more information and
    some Product Owners spent all of their time grooming the backlog. Only one
    team had both.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image18.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image_thumb18.png"
    alt="image" width="640" height="347" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    Ask the Oracle…ehm… Product Owner</strong></p>

    <p>At the end of the course, for the last sprint I had two curve balls to
    throw. The first was an integration exercise that really makes them sweat,
    the other was to introduce some common team dysfunctions. During Lunch I
    solicited a few moles to play the roll of the “hero” or the “absentee
    product owner” among other. All of these dysfunctions were not only noticed,
    but we spent some time looking at how this impacted the teams and what they
    did about it. All of them self-organised around it and non of them failed to
    deliver.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image19.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin:

    src="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image_thumb19.png"
    alt="image" width="640" height="310" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    Working together to achieve the goals</strong></p>

    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Utah and I look forward to going back and
    helping these fine folks out again. It was an eye-opening experience
    teaching so many, and I cheated a little for the TDD demonstration of the
    Engineering practices workshop and I did all of the demos in c#. While it
    felt a little bit like cheating, I did have 7 or 8 people following along,
    even one in Perl.</p>

    <p><a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/files/2012/03/image20.png"><img
    style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display:

    alt="image" width="640" height="313" border="0" /></a><br /><strong>Figure:
    Utah was nice, but it is good to be home</strong></p>

    <p>Well it is so long to Utah, another state ticked of my list, and I hope
    to be back soon…</p>
