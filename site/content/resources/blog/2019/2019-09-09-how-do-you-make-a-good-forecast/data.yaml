    As part of the Scrum.org webinar “Ask a Professional Scrum Trainer - Martin
    Hinshelwood - Answering Your Most Pressing Scrum Questions” I was asked a
    number of questions. Since not only was I on the spot and live, I thought
    that I should answer each question that was asked again here, as well as
    those questions I did not get to.


    In case you missed it, here is the recording of yesterday's Ask a
    Professional Scrum Trainer webinar with Martin Hinshelwood! Watch here: <a

    <h3>[Question] Within an agile Project you have a Product Vision, Smart
    Goals, Sprint Goals and a Roadmap. How do you make a good Forecast? Burnup
    chart is to vague and not accepted, even you have 6-month experience and
    velocity tracking. You need that forecast to get 4 more million of budget
    you know you will need. On top, you need to staff another team. What kind of
    forecast you offer and how do consider the thrid team in your forecast?</h3>

    <em>The metrics that you are currently using will decrease predictability
    and increase overall dissatisfaction with the process from teams to
    management. </em>


    Metrics like Story Points, Burnups, and Velocity do not help predictability
    and indeed may allow your teams to continue delivering chunky features that
    are difficult to predict. The enemy of predictability is size; large
    [batches] PBI have a negative impact on predictability. I find Velocity and
    Story Points are perfectly valid for teams new to Scrum that are fairly
    immature. Once your team is getting in the swing of things I try to very
    quickly introduce flow metrics of Cycle Time, Throughput, Work Item Aging,
    and Work In Process. Not only do these metrics encourage backlog items to be
    smaller, which increases predictability, they also don’t really care about
    the size. You can use your Throughput, Cycle time, and WIP to provide
    evidence for estimates with a far greater degree of statistical certainty.


    I highly recommend that you read Actionable Agile Metrics for Predictability
    from Daniel Vacanti. This book will show you the basis by which you can get
    the data you desire to increase predictability within your organisation.


    The Budget cycle is a holdover from the Tayloristic ideas of the Industrial
    Revolution when we were dealing with more defined work that can be
    predicted. However, in our new world of undefined work where we need to
    iterate to the most right solution, there is no up-front knowledge of how
    long things are going to take. In the Tayloristic world, we know how long
    each widget is going to take to make, so we focus on the delivery of the 10k
    widgets and we can know very predictably when it will be done. Over the
    years this evolved into the budget cycle that we know today. As we moved
    into the knowledge working world applying those tayloristic techniques to
    this new form of work creates huge complexity, that then resulted in huge
    numbers of Project Managers, Accountants, and HR to manage it all.


    However, we can predict to the dollar how much our teams are going to cost!
    Every year; easily!


    If you have 5 people on a Scrum Team then the cost of running that team is
    known by your business, just ask. Take your Sprint length, usually 2 weeks,
    and figure out how much each Sprint costs per team; this may be different
    between teams. You can then be extrapolated across the number of Sprints you
    run in a year, for a yearly cost of each team. Let's say that you figure out
    that you have the people to be able to run 10 teams for 23 Sprints per year,
    and all your teams cost $50k per sprint. You need a budget of $11.5 million
    to run those teams. Each Product gets assigned one or more teams, and voila!
    Moving from a Team-based budget from a Project-based budget is part of that
    transition from a focus on Project to a focus on Product that needs to
    happen as your organisations move towards agility &amp; DevOps.


    The pushback you get from this transition is generally due to those
    deep-seated tayloristic ideas and fear of what your company is going to do
    with all of those Project Managers, Accountants, and HR, as well as those
    Managers that have to justify their headcount. Don’t surprise them, involve
    them. Help them understand what the new world will eventually look like, a
    rough transition timeline, and what other options are open to the folks that
    you no longer need in their current role. Have them join and form Scrum
    Teams to solve complex problems and some folks will embrace change and
    others will not; That's OK.


    While there are no right answers there are some answers that are better than
    others. For your given situation select the most right answer and iteration
    to the best version of it.
