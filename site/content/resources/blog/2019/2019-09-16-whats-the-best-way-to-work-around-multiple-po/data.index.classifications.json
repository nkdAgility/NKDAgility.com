    "reasoning": "The content is focused on clarifying the Product Owner's role in Scrum and addressing practical issues caused by multiple POs. While it emphasizes accountability, value delivery, and backlog ownership, it does so specifically within Scrum's established roles and does not discuss engineering practices, system observability, or maximizing the agency of humans and AI. Key concepts like decentralised decision-making or engineering for agency are not explored; automation, ethical AI, and DevOps ethos are absent. The primary audience alignment is high, as the piece is directed toward Scrum practitioners facing organizational and process challenges, but actual Agentic Engineering themes are not present beyond superficial overlap on value delivery, so confidence is low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses Scrum role clarity, particularly the Product Owner's responsibilities and implications for value delivery. While relevant to practitioners focused on workflow and accountability, it lacks any substantive discussion or design related to Agentic Engineering concepts.",

    "reasoning": "The content is focused entirely on Scrum roles, specifically Product Owner challenges, backlog accountability, and value delivery in a traditional Scrum context. There are no direct or indirect references to agentic software delivery, AI agents, or context-aware automation. The issues discussedâ€”ownership, team responsibilities, stakeholder engagementâ€”are conventional Agile/Scrum topics without any mention of autonomous agents, synergy between humans and AI, governance of agency, or evolution towards agentic delivery. The intent, target audience, and depth remain squarely within legacy Agile delivery, excluding any agentic perspective. No penalties applied as content is not outdated or satirical.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content concerns traditional Scrum Product Owner issues and backlog management, with no reference to agentic software delivery, AI agents, or contextual intelligence. It does not align with the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category.",
