    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses the role of the Scrum Master in addressing impediments, focusing on specific responsibilities rather than the broader topic of capability development within teams. While it touches upon empowering the team and promoting self-sufficiency, which aligns with the notion of capabilities, the emphasis is on a role and accountabilities rather than cultivating an enduring capability. The discussion on skills and learning is relevant but remains secondary to the focus on impediments and the Scrum Master's responsibilities.",
