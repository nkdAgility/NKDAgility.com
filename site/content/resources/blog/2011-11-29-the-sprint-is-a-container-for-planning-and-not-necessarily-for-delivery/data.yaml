    <p>I have been told time and again in the office that Scrum is an inflexible
    platform for developing software as it is way too prescriptive. This is far
    from reality and represents an invalid interpretation in the rules of the
    game. This fault lies not with those that have been turned away from the
    light, but with the fanatics that have brandished the burning torch and
    pitchfork at your door chanting "that is not Scrum because...".</p> <p><a

    height="530"/></a><br /><strong>Figure: Please ignore these
    guys</strong></p> <p>Many of us in the community have a vision of making
    Scrum more accessible to all and to that end, one of the goals of the entire
    Scrum community should be to help the misguided back to the light and
    re-educate the Scrum Coaches ( read Inquisitors here ) that have corrupted
    them.</p> <p>Let me ask you a question;</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>If the
    Scrum Guide is the rules by which the game of Scrum is played, then where is
    it written that your delivery schedule must match up with your planning
    schedule?</strong></p></blockquote> <p>It does say that you should be
    meeting your definition of done for each PBI and at least each Sprint. As
    your definition of done is the quality bar set by the Development Team and
    negotiated with the Product Owner, what is to stop you having the following
    DoD:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Acceptance Tests have been turned into Test Cases</p>
    </li><li> <p>Functional Tests have been turned into Test Cases</p> </li><li>
    <p>Code coverage percentage is the same or better than the last build</p>
    </li><li> <p>All Tests Cases pass</p> </li><li> <p>All Test Cases have been
    turned into Coded UI Tests</p> </li><li> <p>Deployed to QA and full
    automated test suit run</p> </li><li> <p><b>Deployed to
    Production</b></p></li></ul> <p>If you are deploying to production every
    Sprint and even for every PBI then you are one step away from doing it for
    every build, which is Continuous Deployment. Does Scrum say that you can't
    do this? Hell no, it encourages it without mandating it. As long as you meet
    a <a href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/are-you-doing-scrum-really/">simple
    measurable checklist</a>, you can say that you are doing Scrum.</p>
    <blockquote> <p>"Businesses rely on getting valuable new software into the
    hands of users as fast as possible, while making sure that they keep their
    production environments stable. Continuous Delivery is a revolutionary and
    scalable agile methodology that enables any team, including teams within
    enterprise IT organizations, to achieve rapid, reliable releases through
    better collaboration between developers, testers, DBAs and operations, and
    automation of the build, deploy, test and release process."<br />-Jez
    Humble</p></blockquote> <p>Even if you are not practicing Continuous
    Delivery, I would encourage you to deploy more regularly than just once a
    Sprint. I am not saying that it is easy, because it is not.</p> <p>You can't
    do this with immature software either. I see customers fail time and again
    with institutional technical debt and software teams that are highly tuned
    to create it. In order to achieve Continuous Delivery your organisation must
    be committed to minimizing technical debt and to maximizing the value
    delivered to your business. Apart from technical debt there are a quandary
    of things that need to be in place in order to achieve Continuous Delivery.
    Think about the ability to have different versions of the same code running
    in production at the same time while maintaining the contracts and
    separation of concerns that go to make that possible.</p> <p>There are only
    a few organisations that have mastered Continuous Delivery, but the benefit
    that they achieve in being able to get features into production almost as
    fast as the business can think of it.</p> <p>But if you do want to get
    there, or at least take a journey down that road and see how far you want to
    go then there are things that must happen. There are waypoints along the
    road and provide a simple guide to your maturity in this area:</p> <ul> <li>
    <p>Automated Build </p> </li><li> <p>Build Verification Tests </p> </li><li>
    <p>Automated Acceptance Tests </p> </li><li> <p>Automated Functional Tests
    </p> </li><li> <p>Automated Unit Tests </p> </li><li> <p>Automated
    Deployment</p></li></ul> <p>Only once you have all of these thing should you
    then be thinking of what more do you need for your software in your
    environment to be able to successfully deploy your software to production
    and be happy that you have met the correct quality level to achieve
    this.</p> <p>I never tell teams that you MUST do a thing but instead
    encourage them to do the right thing for their organisation in a journey to
    build better software.</p> <p>Now, that is something that we can all aspire
    to.</p>
