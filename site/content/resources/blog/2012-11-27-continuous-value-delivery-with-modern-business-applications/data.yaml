    <p class="lead">I have talked before on the <a
    href="http://blog.hinshelwood.com/the-new-normal-of-the-modern-application-lifecycle/"
    target="_blank">new normal for software development</a> as part of the
    Visual Studio 2012 launch events and Microsoft in itself is not immune to
    this change.</p>

    <p>We as consumers will no longer stand for applications that make us wait
    for 6 months for a new version let alone 2 years. New features need to be
    delivered much more frequently to the consumer and the biggest blocker to
    this is the culture of both the organisation releasing the software and
    their customers.</p>

    <p>The tradition of delivering software every two years so as to minimise
    disruption to our customer is a fallacy that fear and poor quality have
    driven us to. It is time to recant on these old poor practices and fix the
    underlying issues that we have been papering over tissue paper.</p>

    <p>This, by the way, is one of the underlying reasons that the Scrum
    Framework asks us to create working deployable software at least every 30
    days.</p>

    <p>Most companies however don’t believe this and in my experience I hear one
    of the following:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>“We are not a software company”</li>

    <li>“That does not work with our software”</li>

    <li>“not even Microsoft can do this, so how can we”</li>

    </ul>

    <p>These are all just a “cop out” for organisations that do not want, or
    think that they do not need to suck it up and fix the underlying problems
    with their software. Well, Microsoft has decided to not just join the party,
    but lead the way very publically.</p>

    <p>So, you know how big Visual Studio is? Well there is Visual Studio IDE,
    then there is Team Foundation Server and Office integration and… well you
    get the picture.</p>

    <p><img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px;

    height="451" border="0" /><br /><strong>Figure: Visual Studio 2012
    Platform</strong></p>

    <p>Microsoft is now leading the way with Visual Studio and Visual Studio is
    on of the most complex applications I can think of.</p>

    <p>They have moved both the <a
    href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/08/28/tfs-shipping-cadence.aspx"
    target="_blank">Visual Studio IDE and Team Foundation Server to continuous
    delivery</a> with a 3 monthly cadence. Yes, that means that you should now
    be upgrading your Team Foundation Server every Quarter and that your
    developers should be updating their client. But you know what… they don’t
    have to.</p>

    <p>With the move to continuous delivery comes many problems that need
    solving that you just have to fix. We have always know that we had these
    problem but rather than fix them, we implemented dysfunctional behaviour
    around them to reduce their impact.</p>

    <ul>

    <li>How to deploy with minimal production impact?</li>

    <li>How to update the database without hours of down time?</li>

    <li>How to update different components of our application on different
    cadences?</li>

    <li>What if I update one and not the other?</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If you solve these problems not only will you be able to deliver more
    frequently, but what you will deliver will be in smaller chucks and thus of
    less risk. Not only that, in solving your deployment problems and
    essentially continuously practicing them you minimise the risk of delivering
    to production. The result is happy consumers…</p>

    <p>And guess what…</p>

    <p>Just 3 months after RTM and barely 6 weeks after the Visual Studio 2012
    launch the first quarterly update, <a
    href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2012/11/26/visual-studio-2012-update-1-is-available.aspx"
    target="_blank">Visual Studio 2012 Update 1</a>, became available and
    planning for Visual Studio 2012 Update 2 started.</p>

    <p>And that is not even the end of the story, with the launch of <a
    href="http://tfs.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Team
    Foundation Service</a> the Team Foundation Server team, arguably responsible
    for the most complex component of Visual Studio are delivering even more
    frequently. They are effectively on a 3 week Sprint cycle and are delivering
    new features to production to goodness knows how many instances in the cloud
    every three weeks as well as hotfixes every Monday if needed. This is the
    new normal…</p>

    <p>And not only is this a Visual Studio thing; <a
    href="http://www.zdnet.com/apollo-plus-is-this-microsofts-first-windows-phone-8-update-7000007926/"
    target="_blank">Apollo Plus</a> (Windows Phone 8 Update 1) is due almost
    exactly 3 months after the RTM of Windows Phone 8.</p>

    <p>I for one have high hopes of new features for all of Microsoft's products
    every quarter but some products have more technical debt to pay of than
    others…</p>

      This seems like Microsoft's excuse to ship lower quality products and fix
      them fast. It's like when you buy call of duty for the xbox 360 and as
      soon as you start the game for the first time you have to install a
      'update' which is really just a patch for all the things that were left
      broken. If Microsoft moved to the chrome model I'd be happily just keep
      updating silently in the background and I never have to think twice about
      which update is being pushed from google to me.

      Do you really believe that? I think they are moving to the Chrome model,
      but if you are taking existing software you need baby steps to get there.
      I for one am very happy that we are now getting new features for both
      Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server on a more regular cadence and I
      am happy that I do not need hotfixes or service packs!


      p.s. The Update you are talking about on the Xbox come from the game
      developer and not Microsoft! So in the case of Call of Duty that might
      well be Activision!

      p.p.s Would you rather that they released and did not fix anything?
