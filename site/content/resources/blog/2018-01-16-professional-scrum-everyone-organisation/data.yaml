    Recently I worked with a new customer in Denver to help them move towards a
    greater degree of Scrum in their software development. The idea that Scrum
    is for everyone in your organisation is kind of new, but it reflects the
    modern understanding of the way people work, and the rejection of Taylorism
    and command and control. You <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/organisational-change-create-path/">cant use
    someone else approaches to get to agility</a>, but you can learn from it.


    Healthgrades have been doing Scrum for about 8 years but has recognised that
    they are struggling to <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-scrum-teams-build-software-works/">organise
    around the delivery of working software</a>. Like every other company, once
    you have something as complex as software to work on, and knowledge workers
    to do it,<a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-organisational-change-ghana-police-service/">
    the old management styles of the 20th century</a> are just like pouring
    water on a fat fire…

    alt="image" width="1024" height="510" border="0"/>


    This is a common problem that I train Scrum Masters to respond to in the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-foundations/">Professional
    Scrum Master (PSM)</a> class, but the fundamental understanding of why this
    is wrong takes both practical and theoretical knowledge grounded in actual
    experience. This is why the Professional Scrum Foundation (PSF) class <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-scrum-training-ghana-police-service/">requires
    that students work in teams to build working software</a>.


    The real struggle of implementing agile is that of the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-organisational-change-ghana-police-service/">old
    ways, Taylorism, the illusion of command and control, and the belief in
    magic</a>.

    <h2>Professional Scrum is for everyone in your organisation</h2>

    Armed with previous experience with Scrum.org, the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-foundations/">PSF</a>
    class, and me; the CIO, CJ Singh, asked me to come along and train as many
    people as we could in the time that we had available. Turns out that looked
    like 147 people from the engineering department, and my did we had a lot of
    fun. While they have been constantly moving towards a greater degree of
    value delivery there were a lot of misconceptions built up about Scrum over
    the last 8 years… those misconceptions were creating a glass ceiling and
    inhibiting the flow of value to the business.


    https://youtu.be/Fm24oKNN--w


    This is the second time that I have worked with CJ, and again he excelled at
    helping his team understand that it is the makers that are the ones that get
    things done. They are the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/backlog-not-refined-wrong/">ingenuity that
    delivers the value that is needed by the business</a> and they are the ones
    that need to be nurtured. Without the makers coming up with ideas there
    would be no company, and there would be no ideas; no backlog.


    I previously worked with CJ at Backcountry in Utah where I trained everyone
    in the company. I still get emails from folks from Backcountry, even 5 years
    later, and many folks considered the experience of going through the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-foundations/">PSF</a>
    class as "a game changer" for them.


    The purpose of the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-foundations/">PSF</a>
    class is to not only to level set everyone on Scrum but to give them a very
    real understanding of what is required to get significant value from it. If,
    like at Backcountry (Utah), Healthgrades (Colorado), Fraedom (England),
    Teleplan (Norway), and HESA, I can get everyone in the organisation to
    participate something then interesting happens. There is enough of a
    catalyst, a tipping point, that starts the snowball of change rolling.

    <h2>Conversations and discussion is the point</h2>

    The conversations that take place over the 2-day class are ones that don’t
    normally take place and all of the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/scrum-training/">Professional
    Scrum</a> classes are designed to get people talking about their issues and
    what experiments might be useful to find the right way.


    At Backcountry I had everyone from the CTO to the guy that drove the
    forklift in the warehouse. That’s right, everyone… including the CEO's
    assistant… Because everyone in your organisation has good ideas, many are
    direct stakeholders. Getting them to feel that they are empowered to make
    suggestions and to have ideas is part of Agility. Getting the CEO to hear
    all of the questions, and discussion, around why things are not running as
    smoothly as they could be, and what would need to change to make that happen
    is invaluable. Getting the Stakeholders to understand what it takes to build
    software opens their eyes to the involvement they need to have in the
    process. Getting the developers to hear the business realities that create
    the pressures again changes the conversation.&nbsp; How can you possibly
    hope to change your organisation unless everyone is on board and going in
    the same direction?

    As with all courses where one trains everyone there are usually many
    dissenters. Folks that don’t want to be there because they think that they
    know everything or they just don’t think it will be valuable. David was in
    the "were doing Scrum already so why bother" category, but it only took 4
    hours of the class for him to realise how much his understanding had
    deviated from core Scrum. The fundamental understanding of how Scrum
    implements empiricism is something that not only do we need to know, but
    it's nice to have a reset every so often so that we remember the reasons
    why.

    <h2>Creating a bounded environment for change</h2>

    So many teams I work with across the world forget, or never knew in the
    first place, why we have things in Scrum. They forget that we need the
    transparency of the past provided by the Increment of Working Software. They
    forget that without the Product Backlog we get no transparency on what we
    are doing next, and without the Sprint Backlog, we have no visibility into
    what we are doing now. They forget that without that transparency there can
    be no meaningful inspection of what is going on at each of the Events and no
    meaningful change to the way that things happen.


    https://youtu.be/XMLdLH6f4N8


    Many attendees of the Professional Scrum Foundations at all of the companies
    I have done it for, regardless of their existing knowledge level, come away
    with a new appreciation for Scrum, its Artefacts, its Events, and its Rolls.
    Even experienced Scrum Masters like Katherine has something to learn and
    find value in the reset. Its easy to become complacent with the
    organisational dysfunctions that are the "way that things are done here". I
    worked closely with Katherine to make sure each of the 6 class that we ran
    went smoothly and facilitated the right discussions.


    Just as Scrum creates a bounded environment so that we can all be going in
    the same direction in our work, so the Professional Scrum classes create a
    guided environment for discussion and revelation.

    <h2>Iteratively tailored training not content</h2>

    Each instance of the PSF class I learned new things about the organisation,
    its employees, and how it operated that helped me guide the classes to a
    better understanding of Scrum. I use the same material as every other
    accredited Scrum.org trainer worldwide, and I tailored the path. I learned
    which things we can skip over, and which we need to dive headlong into. Some
    of the experiences were traumatic, and the discussions heated, and by the
    end, there was not a single detractor from agility or Scrum in those that
    went through the classes.


    <strong>Healthgrades now has 147 people are the pioneers, evangelists, and
    change agents that now feel empowered to make meaningful change.</strong>


    One of the outcomes of the Professional Scrum Foundations, along with the
    new knowledge and excitement, is an organisational change backlog. One that
    has been created by those that are doing the work and understand the
    constraints and challenges of the work. The hope is that management then
    uses the <a
    href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/agility-guide-evidence-based-change">Agility
    Guide for Evidence-based Management</a> to facilitate changes in the
    organisation to get rid of those pesky impediments to value delivery that
    are out with the control of the teams.


    <strong>Healthgrades now has a Backlog of things that need to change in
    order to facilitate meaningful change.</strong>


    With these two things, agile torchbearers who feel empowered and a list of
    changes, I am hoping that Healthgrades can change their organisation and
    increase their ability to take advantage of market opportunities as they
    arise, and out-manoeuvre their competitors with ease. Refine backlog
    facilitate meaningful change.
