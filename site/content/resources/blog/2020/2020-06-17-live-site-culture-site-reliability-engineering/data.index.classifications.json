The closest related topics (cycle time, deployment frequency) are discussed only in broad DevOps/continuous delivery terms and not within the SLE conceptual framework. The audience (engineering/DevOps practitioners) is somewhat adjacent to the SLE audience, but the match is tenuous since SLE is not referenced and the main purpose is to showcase a specific team's model for agility rather than explain or analyze SLE. A penalty is applied for referencing a 2018 organizational snapshot in a field where best practices develop quickly, reinforcing that the discussion is point-in-time and possibly outdated.
