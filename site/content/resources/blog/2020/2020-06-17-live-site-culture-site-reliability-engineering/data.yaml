    <p>As more and more organisations move towards a higher degree of agility,
    they inevitably also move towards DevOps practices like Continuous Delivery
    to facilitate shortening the feedback loops. </p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Firms today experience a
    much&nbsp;higher velocity of business change. Market opportunities appear or
    dissolve in months or weeks instead of years.</strong></p><cite>Diego Lo
    Giudice and Dave West, Forrester<br />February 2011<br />Transforming
    Application Delivery</cite></blockquote>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Shortening the feedback loop is imperative to remaining competitive in
    this new world of customer-centric realities and that in turn requires a
    radical shift in practices. This shift towards getting things in front of
    your customers as quickly as possible to find out if you are even doing the
    right thing means that we are no longer deploying our products every 2
    years. We are doing it every day. Microsoft, for example, has gone from one
    or two major releases a year to over a hundred-sixty-thousand deployment a
    day. Thats more than the number of engineers that they have. The same
    practices that worked before will not work today. We need to be faster,
    better, and more secure than ever before. Everything must be done within the
    sprint loop and all responsibility needs to lie with those doing the
    work.</p>

    animal-kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most
    effectively have prevailed. ”</p><cite>-Charles Darwin</cite></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In order to sustain this new way we must be able to maintian the
    resonsabilities of high quality with the operational needs of the busienss
    while continiously delivering awesome features that delight our
    customers.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The Combined Engineering model adopted by the Azure DevOps Product Team
    at Microsoft is an example of how one group of about 650 engineers in 3 main
    locations around the world has evolved to be able to cope with these new
    realities. </p>

    <p>The following presentation represents mearly a point in time of their
    evolution that may serve to give you some ideas of where to start, and maybe
    an intial goal to achieve. This infortmation reflects this teams structure
    and thought in 2018 and they have continued to evolve since this content was
    created.</p>
