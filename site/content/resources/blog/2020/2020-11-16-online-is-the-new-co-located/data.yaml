    <p><strong>TLDR; If you are participating in an online event you should be
    transparent and commit to being open &amp; respectful by having
    </strong><em><strong>your camera on</strong></em><strong> and engaging the
    topics and outcomes at hand as best as you are able</strong>. <strong>While
    we show commitment to our fellow participants by keeping our camera on, we
    should in turn respect a participants need to sometimes turn their cameras
    off. </strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p><strong>Just as you would not take a phone call in a meeting and disrupt
    everyone, the same social conventions for meetings should be respected. Let
    folks know in the chat, turn your camera and mic off, return when you can
    focus again.</strong> <strong>If you are unable to use the camera due to
    bandwidth it may be better to attend an in-person event</strong>.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>The idea behind co-location is that with 80% of communication being
    non-verbal we need to be able to be in the same room, space, to be able to
    read each others body language and facial expressions. </p>

    <p>Have you ever been able to tell exactly what the car in front of you will

    <p>When I was a teenager I was in the car with my grandfather and he said:
    "You need to keep your eyes on all of the cars so that you know what they
    are going to do". I scoffed at that idea, but then he said: "See that car,
    it's going to change lane". I scoffed again, but then looked on in
    incredulous wonder as the car moved. I could not understand how my
    grandfather knew, but now that I am a drive I do the same all of the
    time.</p>

    <p>When we are driving we have a learned understanding of driver intent that
    is built over years of driving experience so that we know when the car in
    front is going to change lane even before the signal, and especially when
    they don't. </p>

    <p>We look for micro-changes in the driver's seated position, the road
    position of their car, and the other cars around them. Maybe we also get
    some official and standard notifications thorough the brake lights and
    indicators; if they work. You unconsciously take no account the apparent age
    of the driver and the age and condition of the car. We process all of this
    together and as individual drivers, we partake in an intricate non-verbal
    dance of lanes, signals, and speed that take us safely to our destination.

    <p>Another example is my wife's family is in Cancun, Mexico City, and Puerto
    Rico, as well as elsewhere. Every Sunday they have a family video conference
    with between 20 and 35 people participating all with video and chatting
    away. Technology is awesome.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>This is like a physical team room, except we can also add the other 20%
    with verbal communication as we engage in our activities. Awesome!
    Right.</p>

    <p>Well, it would be if many agile practitioners were not suffering from
    cognitive bias and stuck in the thinking that co-location means in-person.
    Yes, the Irony is not lost on me!  This definition of co-location is over 20
    years old and technology has changed a lot in that time.  </p>

    <p>Its been 25 (1995) years since the first Scrum project and the average
    internet speed was 56kbps! Here is a list of the important dates since then
    and the average internet speed in brackets:</p>

    <p>Today I, along with most folks in the technology industry, have internet
    speed in excess of 200Mbs. Today it is generally no problem to have both
    kids on Netflix/Xbox, and both parents in full HD video conferencing at the
    same time. What a world we live in.</p>

    room, within visual sight of each other.</p>

    <p>This definition encompasses both in-person and virtual events as long as
    we can see everyone. We need to see folks express and posture in order to
    gain a greater degree of transparency over what they are thinking, how they
    are absorbing the information and how we need to adapt the material to
    increase understanding. How do you expect the facilitator to understand what
    you as a participant get or don't without being able to see you? </p>

    <p>For any online event, you should be just as present as you would be in
    person, and to do that you should have your camera on as much as possible. 
    This provides feedback for both other participants and the speaker.</p>

    <p>Do you believe that this group is focused? How would you know? As a

    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>These are all questions that can be easily answered by enabling the
    visual presence that is your camera. If you are uncomfortable with your
    camera then there are options available. I have used FaceRig which gives at
    least some of the 80% that is non-verbal while hiding your bad hair.</p>

    <p>If you are going to be participating in an organized event that will be
    held online then you should consider being somewhere with good bandwidth,
    with a usable background.</p>

    <h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion </h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>With the advancement in video-conferencing, camera quality, and internet
    speed over the last 20 years since agility became a named thing, there is
    very little excuse for not having video-enabled, and to participate with
    your team, or any other group.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>Having your camera on enables as much as 80% more knowledge transfer
    between you and the other participants. Having it off inhibits high
    bandwidth communication. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>So if you are participating in a video conference:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Be respectful, and open with other participants, and use your camera.
    </li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Give the event your full focus and commitment and pay attention or
    leave.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item -->


    <!-- wp:list-item -->

    <li>Have the courage to participate and speak up.</li>

    <!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>All of this together will create the transparency required by your host
    and co-participants to see your participation, how you are reacting, and
    modify the event to make it better. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph {"dynamicAttributes":{"toolsetDSVersion":"240000"}} -->

    <p>If you don't want or can't have your camera on it would be better for you
    and the facilitator that you attend an in-person event.</p>

      In light of the new normal and the last 20 years of technological
      progress, we need to re-define co-location as we no longer need to be in
      the same room as each other to get the 80% of communication that is
      non-verbal. If we are participating in an online event, we must keep our
      cameras on so that we can all read those non-verbal queues.

      <p>To learn and adapt together it is important that all relevant levels of
      the organisation participate in the same training, as the realisations are
      profound. All organisations are different in terms of which ways of
      working are effective for them. Our training will help your people explore
