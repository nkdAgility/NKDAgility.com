    <p> These Sirens&nbsp;take advantage of the lack of understanding of what
    business agility is trying to change and lures unsuspecting C-suite
    executives into parting with their cash for what is effectively someone
    else's business process. They are changing their entire organisation, not
    because of a business challenge, but because they are told to. </p>

    <p>The lure is strong! They can spend a few million dollars and pow, their
    organisation is agile, and our business is saved. They make sweeping changes
    to their lexicon and organisations of their business. We have installed
    agility!</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I'm not saying that SAFe did not work, or that some organisations don't
    get value from it. Just like traditional tayloristic practices, many
    organisations were able to thrive in spite of the choices that they
    made.</p>

    <p>Many <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/live-webcast-the-tyranny-of-taylorism-and-how-to-detect-agile-bs/">large
    organisations are waking up to this reality and are evolving</a> instead of
    transforming. Transformation implies an end, a final stage, and the reality
    of today's businesses is that nothing stays still for long. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Organisations have a lot in common with the animal kingdom. Animals
    evolve to fill a niche and thrive until that niche changes and they can
    either evolve again or die. In the past evolution of companies and the
    changing ecosystem of niches were slow, giving even the largest
    organisations time to adapt. However, those days are gone now. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The world is changing faster and faster and your organisation needs to
    embrace evolution. You need to be able to change to take advantage of new
    business opportunities as they arise and to do that you need a level of
    business agility that may astound you. </p>

    <p>I talk often of the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/live-webcast-the-tyranny-of-taylorism-and-how-to-detect-agile-bs/">tyranny
    of Taylorism</a> and the rigidity that it has instilled over many
    generations and constant bombardment of this is the way this should be done.
    This rigidity of the "best practice" or "we always do it that way", or "we
    can't do that here" is a symptom of that old thinking that was designed to
    manage disengaged factory workers. </p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>SAFe does not change the thinking in the organisation, in fact, it
    solidifies rigidity by saying "this is how you do agile". Thats the very
    antithesis of the intent behind the agile movement. You cant take someone
    else's framework that worked in their organisation, like SAFe or Spotify,
    and install it in your organisation. You end up with fake agile, false
    security that you are embracing change while enshrining in the bureaucracy
    of the "way that we do things here".</p>

    <p><strong>Scaled Agile Framework is just replacing one bureaucracy with
    another. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.</strong></p>

      So what about the Nexus framework? How is that different from LeSS or
      Scrum Scale or SAFe? Patterns can be followed and best practices can be
      adopted like the Toyota Production System. C-Suite executives just have to
      think really hard about what will work for their organizations..and that’s
      why they are paid the big bucks. 


      You can’t pay someone else to do your thinking for you.

      This post was only about SAFe, since it is a prescriptive and un-agile
      framework.


      I consider Nexus, LeSS, and Scrum at Scale to all be a valid part of that
      journey towards agility. The all provide the minimum framework required to
      maintain an empirical process control system at scale and are not
      prescriptive. 


      Indeed in the Scaled Professional Scrum with Nexus training we don't
      really spend that long on Nexus as it has do little prescription. The vast
      majority of the time in the 2 day class is talking about the complimentary
      practices that are just as applicable to LeSS, and Scrum at Scale.

      Well said Martin. Implementing SAFe may not be a right thing to do
      especially for those organizations where the culture is not set in the
      direction towards innovate and create.
