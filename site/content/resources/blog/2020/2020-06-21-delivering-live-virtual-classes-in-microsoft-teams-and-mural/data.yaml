    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/scrum-training/"
    target="_blank">Professional Scrum classes</a> and consulting online. I have
    tried many tools from Zoom and Webex to Miro and Word. The combination that
    I have found gives the most security, flexibility, and features are
    Microsoft Teams with Mural.</p>

    training events in Team with Mural and 3 in Zoom with Mural</a>. Something
    that I, and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/trainers/">other trainers that I work
    with</a>, have found is that to grease the facilitation wheels it is a good
    idea to make sure that the start of the class is not the first time the
    students have seen the technology within which you are running the course.
    To that end, I always now run a Tech Check the week before the class. This
    services several purposes:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><strong>Connection Issues</strong> - If you have 20 students, you
    can lose a lot of time to these issues and frustrate the other students.<br
    /></li><li><strong>General familiarisation </strong>- It surprising up much
    time is lost to fumbling on the first day when students can find the most
    basic of options.<br /></li><li><strong>Setting expectations</strong> - We
    can use a little bit of time to set the expectations that we, as trainers
    have of the students—pre-Reading, Engagement, &amp; participation. 
    </li></ul>

    <p>I recently live-streamed and example <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/_bjNHN4PI9s">Tech Check</a> that I
    use to give students the information that they need to have an excellent
    class, it's a little out of date as I have made my processes much slicker
    since then, but its an example. I'll do another one soon :) make sure that
    you subscribe on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"

    we want to create a safe space for individuals to collaborate, discuss and

    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create that safe space</a>, I
    create a new Team in Microsoft Teams for each class that I am running. This
    allows me to have Scheduled Meetings, Announcements, Storage, and Chat that
    is all secured to the participants of the class.  Microsoft Teams can be
    used to amplify the Scrum Values: </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><strong>Focus </strong>- In the Team for this class there are no
    other distractions. There is Focus on the task at hand which is learning. 
    For real work, I would expect each Product Team to have a Team in Teams with
    each Scrum Team having their own Channel.</li><li><strong>Openness
    </strong>- Within the Team, in Microsoft Teams, we have visibility across
    all of the Channels (self-organizing groups). We can all see the murals and
    we share our experiences in the different
    exercises.</li><li><strong>Commitment </strong>- Teams facilitates the
    students taking accountability for their own time and attention. It allows
    them to use the breakout rooms or not, return or not.
    </li><li><strong>Respect </strong>- Teams, but not using technology to tell
    people what to do created respect for the trainer, and our fellow
    students.</li></ul>

    <p>Scrum thrives on self-organising teams and our job as facilitators of a

    That statement for me precludes any sort of coddling by the trainer and
    using a tool that pushes the students into breakout rooms and forces them
    back after the timebox is the antithesis of the values that we

    <ul><li><strong>Communications </strong>- They can create a Teams meeting
    with "Meet now" or use any of the other video integrations. While I show
    them the "Meet Now" option in the Tech Check I don't force them down that
    route. They could just as easily use Zoom, WebEx, or GoToMeeting as their
    video conferencing tool. All of those are available as apps, and I allow
    students to use whatever they want. <br /><img alt=""

    have always used the "Meet Now" option as it is the easiest to find and use.

    <p>For self-organisation to thrive within agile teams, we need to create
    bounded environments for action, rather than tell people what to do. A
    bounded climate is a critical difference from <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/live-webcast-the-tyranny-of-taylorism-and-how-to-detect-agile-bs/"
    target="_blank">traditional tayloristic practices</a> and as part of
    exploring that we need to demonstrate how it works within our classes.
    Instead of telling people what to do, we give them a Goal, some constraints,
    and some questions to answer, and we accept that there are many right
    answers.</p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If we continuously manage the student's breakout exercises for them, they
    will never learn the value of the timebox nor how to manage that timebox
    themselves. When we instead create a bounded environment and let them get on
    with it, this is where the magic happens. This is what we have always done
    for in-person classes, and it can be even more powerful for virtual as, just
    in the real world of work, there is no indication of the end of the timebox
    for participants. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In one of the classes, we had a group forget to come back from a 5-minute
    timebox, and they kept talking for another 10 minutes. When they eventually
    realised and came back to the main room, they realised their mistake and
    were very sheepish. For the rest of the class, they actively managed their
    timebox and were never late again. That is the sort of learning and
    resultant modification of our own behaviours that we want to encourage. </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In an in-person class, we provide tools; Whiteboard/easel, Pens, Postits,
    Card, etc. We then provide a goal, and constraints, with some questions and
    let students find their own way.</p>

    <p>While Microsoft Teams allows users to self-organize around about
    breakouts and conversations, we need some way to simulate the effect of
    giving students in-person a set of tools and a bounded environment. In the
    virtual world, we need to facilitate the same interaction to promote
    communication and learning. </p>

    <ul><li><strong>Do I require an Account to join a Meeting in
    Teams?</strong><br /><br /><strong>NO. </strong>To <a rel="noreferrer

    href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/join-a-teams-meeting-078e9868-f1aa-4414-8bb9-ee88e9236ee4">join
    a meeting, </a>your students do not need to authenticate and can join
    anonymously, just like Zoom. However, Anonymous users do not get to see
    Channels, Teams, Files, or Apps. They only get to participate in a meeting.
    I use this as a backup link for students that are having difficulty so that
    they can always join, and then I sort out whatever issue with them in the
    first break or activity.<br /></li><li><strong>Do I require a Microsoft
    Account to Authenticate</strong>?<br /><br /><strong>NO.</strong> Previously
    there was some resistance from the trainer community for Microsoft Teams
    that mostly revolved around authentication. In the past, someone entering a
    Team (not a meeting) has to authenticate with either a Microsoft Account or
    an Azure AD account. If they did not have one, they had to create a
    Microsoft Account from their invited email. This is no longer the case; as
    well as adding <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/b2b/google-federation">Google
    identity federation</a>, Microsoft has also added <a rel="noreferrer
    noopener" target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/b2b/one-time-passcode">One-Time
    passcode authentication</a> for signing in. <br /><br />When you try to
    sign-in to a Team with an email that is not Azure AD, MSA, or Google, then
    you are emailed a code to enter without one. Simple, Secure, and alleviates
    that need to create a Microsoft Account.<br /></li><li><strong>Do I need to
    wait 48h when setting up Teams?</strong><br /><br />For now,
    <strong>yes</strong>. When you first set up your Azure AD and your Office
    365 account it has Guests (how students join) disabled by default. This is
    for your security and safety. When you <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-as-team?view=o365-worldwide">enable
    Guest access</a>, it can take up to 48h for it to be active. This is a COVID
    load issue and was not present before. In any case, I do not recommend
    trying to set up Teams for Scrum Training the day before your class. There
    is some amount of work in getting all of the things lined up so that it is a
    smooth and seamless experience for your students. Take your time, and send
    me an email if you need help! Once it is set up, it rocks.<br /></li></ul>

    <h2 id="h-conclusion-microsoft-teams-mural">Conclusion: Microsoft Teams
    &amp; Mural</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I firmly believe that Microsoft Teams, or another similar platform,
    provides the highest level of interaction and allows for self-organisation
    that may other platforms do not.  </p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>With the ability to provide many different services on the same platform
    and have students maintain that access over time, I think it wins out over
    one-time single-shot platforms like Zoom or Webex. In addition, I have a <a

    access to each other as well as some extra goodies. This collaboration and
    access is the icing on the cake. I have seen other trainers do the same with
    Slack as an after-class collaboration, but I have not heard of anyone using
    it to facilitate a class, although I am sure it is possible.</p>
