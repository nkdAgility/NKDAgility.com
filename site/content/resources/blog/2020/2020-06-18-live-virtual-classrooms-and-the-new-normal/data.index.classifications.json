    "reasoning": "The content exclusively discusses the shift from in-person to live virtual classroom training, using modern videoconferencing tools for remote learning. There are no mentions or allusions to AI agents, contextual intelligence, integration of agentic practices in software delivery, or any of the key themes of 'Agentic Software Delivery.' The intent is centered on educational adaptation due to remote work, not software delivery enhancement via autonomous agents or agentic practices. Audience focus is on trainers and students, not software delivery teams. Thus, alignment, depth, and mentions scores are extremely low, with a small audience score reflecting remote knowledge workers as a tangential overlap. No penalty is necessary, as the tone is neutral and the content is not outdated.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about moving training online and remote learning. It does not reference agentic software delivery, autonomous agents, or related practices, and has almost no conceptual overlap with the category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
