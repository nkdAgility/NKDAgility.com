    <p>With the change in business model in the current crisis, many training
    organizations have had to do the unthinkable and move to Live Virtual
    training options. Existing wisdom was that training online, just as running
    teams virtually would be a disaster and reduce the student's experience.</p>

    <p>When Scrum and Agile were first conceptualized the idea of colocation
    meant that we had to have everyone in the same place in order to get that
    extra 80% of communication that is non-verbal.</p>

    <p>However today this limitation does not exist for much of the world. With
    modern and secure video conferencing systems like Microsoft Teams, Google
    Meet, &amp; Webex we can create an almost perfect approximation of
    co-location while being distributed. </p>

    <p>I, along with almost all of my collogues at Scrum.org, have been running
    all of our classes as Live Virtual Classrooms using a verity of technologies
    and we have found that the experience for students is as good as, if not
    better than an in-person class. The trick is that we judiciously use
    breakout rooms and structured exercises with only a small amount of lecture
    to facilitate the greatest amount of learning. </p>

    <p>I for one have found that it is much easier to create interactive
    experiences in the virtual world, and have found that participation is just
    as high as in in-person classes. In a physical room, it is hard to get 20
    people to participate in a big-wall exercise without jostling, crowding, and
    taking turns. In the virtual space, we can make the wall as big as we
    like.</p>

    <p><strong>The New World of Virtual Delivery</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Wow, it is now so much easier to run a class. I don't have to worry about
    flying, hotels, and transport, and neither do my students. It is better for
    the environment and its better for our sanity and family life. While it will
    take a little time for folks to spin up their home office this seems to be
    the new normal. I'm not sure many folks want to go back to many hours of
    commuting, and seasonal sickness, among other issues. </p>

    <p>I think this especially makes sense for the world of product delivery.
    Why go to the same place just to all work at a desk, in a cube, while all
    participating in the virtual world of our computer. </p>

    <p><strong>Welcome the New Normal</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I am sure that an extrovert might have a different opinion initially,
    however, once we are out of lockdown and able to socialize in-person again I
    am sure that they can find their fix. For those of us in the knowledge
    industry, this is a new era. Embrace it, adapt to it, or it may just leave
    you behind!</p>
