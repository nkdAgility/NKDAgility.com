    <p>I am always surprised at the number of teams that release undone work to
    production. I understand that one may need a few sprints, or many if you
    inherited something nasty, to pay back that debt, but if it's more then you
    are not a <a
    href="/blog/scrum-tapas-importance-professionalism/">Professional Scrum
    Team</a>. The sheer amount of software that I have that is buggy, slow, or
    just not finished makes me think that there are few professional <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Teams</a> out there!</p>

    <h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Every organisation has the right to hold their <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers </a>accountable for the
    quality, but never quantity, of the software that they build. Every <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/"></a><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developer</a>
    should pursue engineering excellence through DevOps practices, automation,
    and rigorous attention to detail for every release. Working software builds
    trust with your users and promotes your brand, faulty software encourages
    distrust and hurts your reputation. Defective software and technical debt
    are the causes of the current death grip that organisations have to
    traditional Taylorism based management techniques.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Ultimately if your organisation will
    not let you build software any way you please its because of the shit that
    you have been trying to get away with delivering in the past. You have work
    to do to build trust again.</p></blockquote>

    <h2 id="h-scrum-teams-build-quality-software-that-works">Scrum teams build
    quality software that works</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Working software is software that is free from fault or defect.
    Developers are primarily accountable for the quality and delivering a usable
    increment. While they are also responsible for value delivery, the
    accountability for that lies with the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a>. That means
    that if there is a choice between delivering value that lacks quality or
    providing less value that is of higher quality, <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/"></a><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>
    should always choose quality.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Since "rules are for the guidance of wise people, and the obedience of
    fools" I am going to caveat that statement for those that like to latch onto
    absolutes. Since any software that you build is an organisational asset, and
    all assets are attributed to the value of your company then that software
    must exist on a balance sheet somewhere. If you as the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>
    decide to cut quality to make a delivery do you immediately speak to the CFO
    so that they can accurately reflect that loss of value on the companies
    balance sheet? Because if you don't, then knowing or not there is a danger
    that your organisation is committing fraud by inaccurately reflecting the
    value of your software! Ultimately the decision to cut quality should only
    be taken with the full consent and understanding of your executive
    leadership team.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The decision to cut quality is not one

    not about expectations!</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Working software is software that is free from fault or defect, but it
    does not necessarily meet the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner's</a> or stakeholders expectations.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>It is just not possible for everyone's expectations to be understood let
    alone met, and thus it is unrealistic to expect the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/"></a><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>
    to deliver on them. At the end of every <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#the-sprint">Sprint</a> we have a <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#sprint-review">Sprint Review</a> where we
    invite stakeholders, and the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Team</a>, to pause and
    reflect on the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-backlog">Product
    Backlog</a> based on that which was delivered. There you can explore the
    difference between expectation and delivery and then update the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-backlog">Product Backlog</a> to reflect
    that difference. The <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum
    Team</a> should continuously be investigating the difference between what
    they delivered and stakeholders expectations so that they can close that gap
    as much as possible, so while they are responsible for meeting expectations,
    they can't be held accountable.</p>

    does not tell you how to build working software. It only states that its

    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/developers/">Developers</a>
    If you don't have working software, then you are not yet doing Scrum,
    although you might be working towards it.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>So, to define working software we have to look at what working software
    is not:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

    <ol><li><strong>Known errors or exceptions</strong> - if you find a bug then
    fix it. If it's too big, then raise it with the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a>, and get it on the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-backlog">Product Backlog</a>. To much
    time is spent managing rather than fixing bugs. Just fix
    them.</li><li>Manual Tests - if you have manual tests then you are already
    working towards software that does not work, or that you struggle to
    deliver. It is unsustainable to have any manual testing, so get
    automating.</li><li>Manual pipelines - in 2017 no-one should be building
    production code on their local computer, never mind shipping it to
    production from there. Even if all your build does is package up some files,
    and push them to an FTP location. Automate your build process... If you have
    a person that has to do something more than approving between code and
    production, then you should look to automate that process away. Humans make
    mistakes, and humans miss stuff. At least with an automated process if not
    continuous delivery, you get consistency, and you can increase the
    complexity over time for consistency. Make sure that you automate both your
    build and release pipelines.</li><li>No Source Control – Yes, I still meat
    organisation with no Source Control, or no control over it. I wrote Getting
    started with modern source control and DevOps for just that reason. If you
    don't even have source control, whatever you are developing, then you need
    to get help and quick. The business risks that are exposed by not having it
    are just too big.</li><li>Lack of feature flags – It is a fundamental
    fallacy of the rejected backlog item, and your engineering team is going to
    have to figure out how to release at the end of every sprint (or every
    commit) regardless of the quality of the PBI’s being worked on. Hide
    features that are not completed behind feature flags so that they are not
    visible to end-users, but your code can still be shipped.</li></ol>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The other name for the things that make it difficult to get to working
    software; Technical Debt. All of the things listed above are forms of
    Technical Debt, but the biggest form is just poor quality code. Code that is
    not tested or would not meet even a cursory code review by another software
    engineer.</p>

    happens if Developers are not accountable for Quality?</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>
    are not held accountable for quality why do you believe that you have it?
    Quality is one of those hidden measures in software that can be there or
    not, and you would not know unless you were using that product in anger. If
    you put pressure to deliver on a <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/"></a><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/developers/">Developers</a>,
    they will consistently and increasingly cut quality to meet whatever
    ridiculous deadline you give them.</p>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Every organisation needs to focus on delivering quality working software
    that is of use to its customers. The entire <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Team</a> is accountable and
    then works together over many iterations, experimenting and continuously
    improving, to deliver the best possible outcome in the circumstances. So
    instead of being an amateur team, be a team of Professionals that deliver
    working software because that is what your organisation and your customers
    deserve. If you are having a hard time delivering then discuss your options
    anytime, but especially at your Sprint Retrospective, and figure out what
    actionable improvement you can make that will help you pay back some of your
    technical debt and move forward. Once such step could be making sure that
    your <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/"></a><a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/training/audiences/developers/">Developers</a>
    at least understand this with a <a

    Scrum Developer</a> course.</p>

      Key to this topic is really determining what "Free from fault or defect"
      really means for a given situation. Lets look at performance - something
      that rarely has a set of specifications defined.


      What about a "slow web page"?  What is meant by "Slow" (I am sure someone
      would not be happing if a shipping cart displayed "please wait" for 24
      hours!)


      What about a low level function in a real-time application? Is an
      implementation that takes 1uS "defective" when there is an implementation
      that can take 800nS?  [this is from a real case, were that difference
      caused a failure in the field!]


      Establishing these boundaries and having them communicated is a key
      component. Perfection can never be achieved - appropriate quality must be
      the practical goal.

      "Definition of Done" is the top level. Typically I see things like "test
      pass", etc. All of these are good things.


      From a pragmatic (i.e. empirical, experienced based) perspective I find
      that having a distinct "Definition of Quality" which can be highly
      technical as a distinct artifact (with different ones appropriate under
      different conditions) has value.


      When this implementation is used, the DoD contains "Software has met the
      requirements of the (Appropriate) Definition of Quality.


      In effect, just a refactoring from a single artifact.

      I have some further information at:
      http://www.dynconcepts.com/quality-software-know-want/


      I agree about the "mirror" part, but have repeatedly found that if the top
      level DoD artifact gets too deep then it is less consumable by the
      necessary people. Additionally, by encapsulating and referencing it is
      possible (and I believe a good thing) to have a consistent (top level) DoD
      with the details as appropriate.


      I can just imagine something along the lines of "For method with a
      cyclomatic complexity exceeding X, the number of statements within a
      partition should not exceed Y" [probably with a chart of X, Y values and a
      third column with impact/risk analysis." being *directly* in the DoD.

      Absolutely nothing. In fact the "[link]" approach is exactly what I was
      trying to communicates - as opposed to having all of the details directly
      in one document.

      [&#8230;] Just to be clear, this is not about Done. I expect every team to
      produce work that meets whatever definition of done that they have agreed
      with the Product Owner. If the Development Team calls Done when they are
      not then that is a wholly separate problem… because Professional Scrum
      Teams build software that works. [&#8230;]

      [&#8230;] You can call the activity that results from dropping out of the
      while loop of working software to be a Scrumble; You need to stop piling
      more features on top of the features that don’t work and fix things so
      that you can make new things. Ultimately professional teams build software
      that works. [&#8230;]
