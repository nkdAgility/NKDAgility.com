    Strategic Goal</a> that is needed to evaluate and adapt your progress
    towards your intended visions of your product.</p>

    <p>The key to realising an agile mindset within the business is the idea of
    experimentation and that we don't know where we want to get to, largely
    because the future of our business is clouded in the fog of war. There is
    always a high degree of uncertainty of the future and nothing has
    illustrated that more in recent times than the COVID-19 pandemic. Every
    business had to reassess its Strategic objectives more than normal, and
    normal is often a lot. </p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The&nbsp;<strong>fog of
    war</strong>&nbsp;(German:&nbsp;<em>Nebel des Krieges</em>) is
    the&nbsp;uncertainty&nbsp;in&nbsp;situational awareness&nbsp;experienced by
    participants in&nbsp;military operations.&nbsp;The term seeks to capture the
    uncertainty regarding one's own capability, adversary capability, and
    adversary&nbsp;intent&nbsp;during an engagement, operation, or campaign.
    Military forces try to reduce the fog of war through&nbsp;military
    intelligence&nbsp;and friendly force tracking
    systems.</p><cite>Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>

    <p>Since presenting <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/evolution-not-transformation-this-is-the-inevitability-of-change/">Evolution
    not Transformation: This is the Inevitability of change</a> I have come to
    realise more and more that it is the Business and Executive leadership that
    is holding back the <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/live-webcast-the-tyranny-of-taylorism-and-how-to-detect-agile-bs/">retirement
    of the traditional practices that were developed to manage factory
    workers</a> in favour of those needed to manage cognitive work. Even a
    cursory look at many of the modern organisations that are able to adapt to
    business changes shows a far greater success than other more traditionally
    run businesses. Think Spotify, Zappos, Microsoft, Apple, Google.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We need to adopt the key practices of <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/blog/product-goal-is-an-intermediate-strategic-goal/">Product
    Discovery</a> that is adapted for the modern world. These are:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><strong>Outcome over Output </strong>- In order to reassess our
    existing management practices we need to ask the question "<em>Does the
    practice increate our output or outcome?</em>". Don't be trapped into
    delivering lots of poorly made, poorly targets deliverables. You want your
    smart creative people spending time on the valuable outcomes that change
    your customer's behaviour to benefit the organization. Some examples of
    traditional practices that were developed to maximise output rather than
    outcome are; Task and Bonus, Departments (Sales, Marketing, HR, Engineering,
    Test), Work Breakdown Structure, progression through salary and job title.
    if you are not running a factory during the industrial revolution then you
    may need to reevaluate the impact of these practices on your desired
    outcomes. The Standish Group in Boston has an annual report that
    consistently shows, through data analysis, that traditional project
    management practices (Prince2/PMI/other) have a negative impact on your
    organisation's ability to deliver value in cognitive work like Software,
    Sales, and Marketing.</li><li><strong>Investment Opportunities</strong> - We
    still need to budget but instead of traditional project-based that falls
    into the trap of output over the outcome, we need a new model that reflects
    Outcomes and Opportunities for discovery that will make our business more
    successful. This new Budgetary model can revolve around Delivery Teams that
    represent our investment. <em>As yourself how many teams are we willing to
    invest in discovery for any given opportunity?</em> Over the course of a
    year, you may readjust where the Delivery Teams spend their time based on
    what you learn. Stop investing Delivery Teams time in areas that it is clear
    that you are not getting an adequate return on investment. Each year we can
    assess how many teams, in each of our value streams, we are willing to fund.
    </li><li><strong>Experimentation </strong>- There are no failures only
    learnings and our goal needs to be to minimise the cost of these learnings
    and maximizing the success. Short iterative experiments in any investment
    opportunity. A good example is the Azure DevOps teams at Microsoft where
    they have ~42 teams that they can invest in Azure Pipelines, Azure Boards,
    Azure Repos, and other verticals in the product. Each vertical will have its
    Intermediate Strategic Goal (Product Goal) and a budget of "headcount" (read
    teams) that they can use to invest in moving towards that Intermediate
    Strategic Goal, one experiment at a time. If leadership believes that they
    are not making enough progress in a particular vertical they are free to
    relocate teams to address this based on market
    analysis.</li><li><strong>Hypothesis Driven</strong> - To understand the
    outcome of the experiment we need some sort of hypothesis. This is like an
    assumption, but with one important distinction; We have a measure that will
    tell us if our assumption is true. It is the accountability of Product
    Management (likely as a Product Owner) to validate their assumptions using
    data and minimise the spend to get there. Running many small experiments
    where the Delivery Teams create small valuable outcomes that you can test
    with real users and validate is imperative.</li></ul>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We need to reassess the use of the terms Scope &amp; Failure in light of
    this new reality and evolve into a lean data-driven organisation based on
    experimentation and discovery that allows us to adapt to business changes as
    they arise!</p>
