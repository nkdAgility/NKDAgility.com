    <p>Most <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Teams</a> that I
    encounter don’t do refinement of their <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-backlog">Product Backlog</a> and try to
    work on things that they don’t understand correctly. However, if you get to
    the Sprint Planning event and your backlog is not ready, then you are doing
    it wrong. If what you build is not of good quality then you should <a

    Done</a>.</p>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you get to the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#sprint-planning">Sprint
    Planning</a> event and your Product Backlog Items for the next Sprint are
    not already of a size that can fit into the Sprint and fully understood by
    the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>, then you are
    doing it wrong. You are heading for the rocks from the start, and you have
    no map of the shallows to prevent it.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Although the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Scrum Guide</a> does not
    define Refinement as an event, you should be doing it. You can come up with
    your Refinement event(s), or refine ad-hoc. Whatever you chose there is a
    simple measure of success. If your <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> looks at something
    within the next 2 Sprints on the backlog and they don’t understand it, then
    you have work to do.</p>

    <p>If you find that you can't quite get things to fit and <a
    href="/blog/a-better-way-than-staggered-iterations-for-delivery/">have to
    stagger iterations</a>, or you are just not able to deliver at all, then a
    lack of refinement is usually at fault.</p>

    <h2 id="h-what-does-ready-mean-for-a-product-backlog">What does ready mean
    for a Product Backlog?</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> does
    not understand the things that they are being asked to do how could they
    possibly agree that the items can fit in a Sprint? You will often find teams
    that don’t do refinement confused as to why they can't get everything done
    in a Sprint. While we accept that in an empirical process like Scrum that
    we, know less upfront than we discover as we go, merely taking a guess and
    hoping for the best is decidedly unprofessional.</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Selecting how much can be completed
    within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the&nbsp;<a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>&nbsp;know about
    their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of
    Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts."<br
    />-ScrumGuides.org</p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>While we don’t need a definition of ready, we do need a working agreement
    between the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a>
    and the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>. In
    Scrum, the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> are
    the ones selecting work for the Sprint, and they are the only ones that can
    decide what they can do. <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> should be empowered
    to refuse to take items from the backlog that either they do not understand,
    or are too big to be completed in a single sprint. In general, I would
    expect that a <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">team</a> take many
    items into their Sprint, so they need to be sized appropriately.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Ready Backlog just means that the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> can select it with
    confidence.</p>

    <h2 id="h-how-do-you-refine-your-backlog">How do you refine your
    backlog?</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Refinement is not an explicit event in the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/">Scrum Guide</a> because it is something that
    can be different depending on the Product, Domain, or Technology. If you
    were to ask how much refinement you should do then the answer is "as much as
    you need and no more". Too much refinement is waste, as it too little.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Product Backlog refinement is the act
    of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller
    more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a
    description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of
    work."</p><cite>-<a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/">The 2020 Scrum
    Guide</a></cite></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The amount of time that <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> spend on refinement
    is based on the need. However, this need for refinement will vary over the
    life of the product and you should be spending as much time as your need
    while maximizing focus on the realisation of value. I have found that many
    teams that were not doing refinement in the past may need considerably more
    time to get their backlog into some semblance of order. Once it is in order,
    you are generally only maintaining a rolling Sprint projection, based on
    your effective planning horizon, of what you might achieve.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I usually run at least the first refinement as a guided workshop. By
    running one before a Sprint Planning most teams will see the value of it by
    the end of the next Sprint. For the workshop, I get the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-team">Scrum Team</a> (<a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a>, <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a>, &amp; <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#scrum-master">Scrum Master</a>) into a room
    with any necessary subject matter experts and we merely open the existing
    backlog and review it. Start at the top and ask the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> if this is the
    next most important thing? If not, find something that is. Then have the <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product Owner</a> read and
    explain it, then discuss and add details.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Any time the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-owner">Product
    Owner</a> deviates from the text that is in the Backlog Item, or adds more
    information, stop and have someone add that info to the Backlog Item. Ask
    the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> to estimate
    the item, "Does this look like it can fit with many other friends into a
    single Sprint?". If the answer is no, then you get to work breaking it down,
    reordering in the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#product-backlog">Product
    Backlog</a>, and start refining again. You continue this process until the
    <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> agrees that there
    is enough backlog refined for the next 2 Sprints.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This enables your<a
    href="/blog/release-planning-and-predictable-delivery/"> Product Owner to be
    able to plan future releases</a> and your <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> to create an
    implementation plan for the current one.</p>

    <h2 id="h-how-do-you-monitor-your-refinement-effectiveness">How do you
    monitor your refinement effectiveness?</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>During the <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#sprint-planning">Sprint
    Planning</a> event, your <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> should be able to
    quickly select many Product Backlog Items that go towards the chosen <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#commitment-sprint-goal">Sprint Goal</a> and
    agree that they fit. If you can do this, and most of the time you get most
    (not all) of the Items delivered, then you are probably doing enough
    refinement. If you can't, then you need to focus a little more on Refinement
    and making your Product Backlog ready.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If at your <a href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#sprint-review">Sprint
    Review</a> the <a
    href="/blog/the-fallacy-of-the-rejected-backlog-item/">Product Owner is
    always wanting to reject that Backlog Items are complete</a> then there is
    unlikely to be enough refinement for the Development Team to understand what
    they are expected to do.</p>

      100% agreement. In addition to sessions that focus on backlog refinement,
      there can be much more. For teams that choose rich/robust backlogs [as
      compared to minimal], backlog refinement can actually happen at every
      point of activity. Continuous Refinement initially takes discipline, but
      experience has shown that for many it provides large value from minuscule
      elements of work.
