    "reasoning": "This content focuses strictly on Scrum backlog refinement, team practices, and process mechanics. There is no discussion or mention of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or modern agent-human integration. The entire article is about classic human-driven Scrum routines; no topics related to agentic principles (AI-powered refinement, agent support, governance for agents, feedback loops with agents, etc.) appear. The relevance is almost non-existent except that backlog refinement is mentioned, which, in agentic systems, could be a use case for agents. However, none of the text relates it to AI, agency, or emerging delivery models, so the overall confidence must be extremely low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses solely on human-centric Scrum backlog refinement with no mention or implication of agentic software delivery or agent integration. Does not fit the assigned category except for a generic delivery process reference.",
