    <p>Many teams are struggling with delivering modern software because they
    are not building with Test First Principals. Test First gives us the
    assurance that we have built the correct thing, that what we built is what
    the customer asked for and that when we change things we don’t break
    anything inadvertently.</p>

    <h2 id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR;</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>While it takes time, effort, dedication and discipline to achieve Test
    First the return on investment is enormous. A common form of Test First is
    Test Driven Development (TDD) and we can use it to meet more of our
    customer's expectations, minimise our maintenance costs, and get fewer
    regressions and bugs in production. Ultimately without working in a
    test-first culture, you will be <a
    href="/blog/continuous-deliver-sprint/">unable to do continuous delivery</a>
    with any confidence.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The only question for professional <a
    href="/the-2020-scrum-guide/#developers">Developers</a> is how to get
    started.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2>You are doing it wrong if you are not using test first</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>If you look up Test First on Wikipedia you will be redirected to the Test
    Driven Development (TDD) page and I believe this to be incorrect. While TDD
    is one, arguably the most effective, form of Test First it is by no means
    the whole thing. Can I achieve Test First with no automation at all: Yes.
    Can I do TDD with no automation at all: No. Do you see my conflict…</p>

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>If you are building
    applications without writing your tests first then you are doing it wrong.
    Your process will result in significant rework, be less maintainable and be
    less likely to meet the customers
    needs.</em></strong><small><strong>Scottish Software Proverb</strong> (just
    made it up, and I am Scottish)</small></p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Unfortunately, while the proverb above is absolutely true there are many
    fanatics that will not accept that you can do test-first without automation.
    Just like the <strong>Process Wars</strong>, the <strong>Practice
    Wars</strong> are being waged around us, and while we want to endeavour to
    be agnostic it is not possible to be an atheist.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>You will hear a lot of different terms banded about in relations to test
    first:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list -->

    <ul><li><strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong> – Automated tests
    created before the code is written to validate that we need that
    code.</li><li><strong>Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)</strong> –
    Tests, either automated or manual, that validate business
    functionality</li><li><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong> –
    An automated test that validates a particular behaviour that you want your
    application to have.</li><li>etc…</li></ul>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>All of these topics, and more, are
    covered in the <a
    href="/training/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training/">Professional
    Scrum Developer (PSD) training</a> that was build in combination with
    Scrum.org and Microsoft as the only official team training for Scrum &amp;
    DevOps.</p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>These terms all fulfil a specific niche and the evolution of modern
    software development will sprout many more. Find that which solves your
    specific problem and adapt until you have something that works for you, your
    team and your organisation.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading -->

    <h2>The essence of test first</h2>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Test First has two main goals, both of which are as important as each
    other.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The first is about professionally validating that which you have built.
    Software Development is complicated and one can easily create unintended
    results when that code is executed. This is not a quotient of poor
    programming but of the complexity of the task. In the eighteen hundreds,
    plumbers pumped smoke through the pipes to make sure that there were no
    leaks on the grounds that if it is good enough for the smoke it is good
    enough for water. This mentality has resulted in what we now call the ‘smoke
    test’ in software development and the result of its implementation is bugs
    in production. When compared to software development plumbing is simple;
    modern software is many times more complex than Software was even 10 years
    ago. We have accepted poor quality deliverables and expensive maintenance
    for far too long.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The second goal is to shorten your feedback loops. The closer our
    engineers are to when the problem was created the quicker they can find it
    and the cheaper it is to fix. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell in
    most software what ‘right’ looks like and developers just take a guess. The
    attitude that a problem, if it exists, will be caught by Quality Assurance
    (QA) or User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is unprofessional at best and
    incompetence at worst. We want to <strong>know</strong> that what we have
    just written not only meets our customer's expectations but also does
    exactly what we intended for it to do under as many circumstances as we can
    think of.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>Test First allows us to
    mature from simply testing quality in towards building that quality in from
    the start</em></strong><small><strong>Jeff Levinson</strong>, Architect at
    Boeing</small></p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Fundamentally it is far cheaper to fix an issue closest to its source.
    The longer we leave the finding of that defect the more expensive it
    becomes. A bug found in production is <a
    href="http://www.scrum.org/About/All-Articles/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/644/Agile-Economics-The-Dollars-and-Sense-of-Scrum"
    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 times more costly</a> to fix
    than the same bug found in development.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>The three virtues of Test First:</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

    <ol><li>Validation of building what was asked for</li><li>Validation that
    what we have built works as we intended</li><li>Validation that changes have
    not broken original intent</li></ol>

    <!-- /wp:list -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Ideally, we want our tests to be as close to the code as possible, but
    also as easily understood by the customer as possible. Ideally, all of our
    code is automated and we have an executable specification. It's a balancing
    act…</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3>Business Validation – We have built what was asked for</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Getting validation that we are building the right thing is key to
    actually being able to build the right thing. This sounds like a no-brainer
    but what do we usually do?</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Well, we usually take our requirements, in whatever form we generally
    make them, and give them to our coders to turn into working software. Quite
    separately we give the same requirements to our testers and they create a
    bunch of tests to validate what we have built.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Did you notice the problem with this workflow?</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>The worst that can happen
    is that we built exactly what the customer asked
    for!</em></strong></p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>How can we ever build to meet the measure if we don’t build to what is to
    be measured? We need to flip that on its head and instead have the tests
    created first (the measure) and then Code to make the tests pass. Now that
    we have removed the inevitable time-consuming rework we can take that time
    and use it to create even more value for our customers.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In addition, we are far more likely to be able to meet our customers
    expectations now we have an additional level of focus provided by those
    tests.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3>Developer Validation – What we have built works as we intended</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>It's now 2020 and gone are the cowboy days of the late nineties and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naughties" target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener">early naughties</a>. Along with <a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/getting-started-with-modern-source-control-system-and-devops/">using
    modern source control</a>, software engineers can no longer hide behind
    their management as "not giving the approval to do Unit Testing", or
    changing what "unit testing" means to allow them to bypass the requirement.
    This is <a href="/blog/scrum-tapas-importance-professionalism/">about
    professionalism</a> and all developers, no matter what they are working on,
    should be validating the work that they do.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>You are not a professional
    if you do not do the due diligence necessary to validate what you have
    created works as intended and continuous to do so.<br />-<a
    href="https://nkdagility.com/professional-scrum-teams-build-software-works/">Professional
    Scrum teams build software that works</a></em></strong></p></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>There are two main value-adds here. The first is that when a coder
    creates functionality it does exactly what he intended and we have a record,
    and executable specification, of what that intent was. The second comes
    later. When we go to add functionality later we know when we have broken
    existing functionality and that is one of the most valuable parts of this
    endeavour.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Can you imagine how amazing it would be if you could use this
    executable specification to validate all future changes don’t break your
    application?</strong></p>

      Well thought out blog post. You missed one key reason it's wrong to not
      develop software test first. There is no way to deliver software faster
      than test first, other than to never execute the code you write. Once you
      accept you need to execute the code you write, this means every usage
      interaction, every form submission that is done manually is effort that
      has become lost the moment it's over. With test first, all work that is
      spent in arranging and validating test scenarios is continuously carried
      forward instead of lost with every push of F5.

      Along the same lines, once you develop a solution in code you have a
      natural bias to accept it as correct (even if there are differences or
      omissions in the solution vs. requirement). By writing tests first you
      clarify the understanding of the requirements before you invest any effort
      or ego into the solution.

      In general, I agree with your posts.   And I am certainly glad to see
      another vocal champion of executable specifications.


      "Validation that what we have built works as we intended.... Developer
      Validation – What we have built works as we intended"... Etc


      Nitpick (orthogonal to Test First):   For that, I use "verification" to
      distinguish from "validation".  Verification is "building things right";
      validation is "building right things".   To me, verification is to
      validation as precision is to accuracy.

      I did an update of this post and I included the distinction that you
      mentioned. I just missed that on the original pass :) thanks.

    comment_content: "[&#8230;] Test first – Test first is about not doing any work unless there is a measurable test that elicits that work. Creating tests from acceptance criteria will make sure that your team is working on and understands the next most relevant thing to be worked on and that you have built what the customer wants. Additionally, creating unit tests before code will make sure that your coders are working on the most relevant problem, and that each line of code that they complete does exactly what they intended. The long term benefit of this is that we now have an executable specification that will result in an error if a future change breaks existing functionality.\_You are doing it wrong if you are not using test first.

      [&#8230;] changes that now need to make it that which the Product Owner
      envisaged. So it meets “done”, it meets the acceptance criteria, and it is
      still not what the Product Owner wanted. Is this the Development Teams
      fault? Of course [&#8230;]
