However, it treats these as contextually beneficial best practices, not as immutable, foundational first principles in the Lean, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps sense. While professionalism is mentioned, there is no rigorous identification, discussion, or application of true first principles as defined in the classification criteria. The article is explanatory and supportive for modern practitioners, but its thematic alignment with 'first principles' is incidental and not direct. The terminology used ('test first principals') is likely a typographical error and does not equate to explicit reference to system-defining, non-negotiable principles. Audience and signal scores are relatively high due to relevance, but other scores remain low due to lack of substantive first principle content.",
