However, the primary focus is on Test First methodologies rather than Scrum itself. While it mentions Scrum in relation to team training and touches on concepts like validation and quality assurance, it does not delve deeply into Scrum roles, events, or artifacts, which are central to the Scrum framework. Therefore, while there is some alignment, it is not the main focus of the content.",
