    "reasoning": "The content briefly mentions the need for the right people in an organization and discusses cultural constraints in transitioning to an agile model. However, it primarily focuses on the concept of 'Luddites' and resistance to change, rather than delving deeply into capabilities as enduring competencies. The discussion is superficial in terms of capability development methods and lacks in-depth examples or strategies specifically related to enhancing organizational capabilities. Consequently, while capability is acknowledged, it is not the primary focus, resulting in a low confidence score.",
