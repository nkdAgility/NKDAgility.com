There is no exploration of backlog management, prioritisation, or any key topics related to Product Backlog. The main audience—Scrum practitioners—matches the target for Product Backlog discussions, but substantial content focus and intent do not fit the category. Depth, alignment, intent, and mentions are all low due to lack of thorough Product Backlog discourse. No penalties apply.",

    "reasoning": "The content is entirely focused on the Definition of Done (DoD) in Scrum: what it is, how to create it, and its role in ensuring working software and quality increments. There is no mention—direct or indirect—of the 'Definition of Workflow,' nor does the content address workflow policies, WIP limits, entry/exit criteria, or the governing flow of work as described in Kanban/agile theory. It consistently discusses checklists and quality commitments for completed increments (DoD), not dynamic workflow agreements. The concepts, vocabulary, and practical advice are all exclusive to DoD, excluding all the core principles and distinctions for the Definition of Workflow category. Audience alignment is weak as it targets Scrum practitioners focused on quality and DoD, not teams concerned with defining and visualizing workflow.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content solely discusses the Definition of Done in Scrum—its purpose, checklist items, and team adoption. It does not mention or align with the Definition of Workflow, dynamic flow policies, or Kanban practices, making it a poor fit for this category.",
