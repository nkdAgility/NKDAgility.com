There is no direct mention of 'Service Level Expectation (SLE),' nor are any synonymous terms or definitions used. No components of SLE such as elapsed time range, probability, or the calculation/application of SLE in Agile or Kanban contexts are discussed. The main intent is to clarify misconceptions in Scrum processes, not to inform about, define, or improve SLEs. The target audience (Scrum practitioners, Product Owners, team members) slightly overlaps with the SLE’s audience, but the message is strictly on Sprint Review, Done/Not Done, team accountability, and feature delivery mechanics (e.g., feature flags), not flow metrics or forecast reliability. The discussion is substantial for its own topic but entirely ignores SLE, making the signal for the SLE category almost absent. No penalties are applied as the content is not outdated or contradictory; it simply is off-topic for SLE. The final low confidence score reflects the lack of direct or indirect connection to Service Level Expectation.",
