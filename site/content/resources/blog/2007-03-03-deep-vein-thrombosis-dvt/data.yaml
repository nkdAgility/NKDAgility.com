  - "<div style=\"float: left\">\_</div>\n<p style=\"float: left\">As most of my friends know a very good friend of mine, Katie McPherson died 4 years ago of DVT. I would like to share a letter I received from her brother, another very good friend of mine, and I would ask you to sign the petition.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As you\_will be aware in the light of my sisters death some four years ago from a DVT,\_my family and I have been battling for changes to be made regarding the awareness and treatment of DVT throughout Scotland.</p>\n<p>Over the past years we have found there is a gene which has been shown to increase susceptibility to DVT. This is called \"Factor V Liden\". I am one of the lucky people carrying this gene:-).</p>\n<p>We as a family are pushing for this test to be given to all new born babies as well as young women\_prior to them\_being given either\_the contraceptive pill or HRT. The said medication combined with the Factor V gene unfortunately\_increases the likelihood of developing a DVT.</p>\n<p>If an individual\_is aware\_of this increased susceptibility they\_should also\_be made aware of the symptoms of a DVT and how to combat them.\_</p>\n<p>DVT is not uncommon (\"more people die from a dvt every year than that of\_breast cancer,\_road accidents and MRSA combined\")\_but it\_can be treatable if caught\_early enough.\_</p>\n<p>As part of our ongoing 'battle' we have raised an\_epetition for this matter\_to be raised\_as a discussion at the Scottish Parliament.</p>\n<p>I would ask\_for your support in this matter by following the link below and signing the online petition.\_</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=155\">http://epetitions.scottish.parliament.uk/view_petition.asp?PetitionID=155</a>\"</p>\n<p>Stephen McPherson</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that many of you will sign this petition...</p>\n<p>If you are not familiar with this story you can read more at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=633&amp;id=252612005\">Could 30,000 deaths a year be prevented?<br />\nTragedy of Katie McPherson</a><span class=\"pubdate\"><br />\n<a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=633&amp;id=959892004\">The student who predicted she would die</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=633&amp;id=1180472004\">Family blame medics' error for DVT death <br />\n'Don't let mistakes kill another patient'<br />\nInvestagation into DVT death reveals case of 'bad luck'<br />\n<br />\n</a></span>Technorati tags: <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/DVT\"><font color=\"#0000cc\">DVT</font></a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Katie%20McPherson\"><font color=\"#0000cc\">Katie%20McPherson</font></a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Deep%20vein%20thrombosis\"><font color=\"#0000cc\">Deep vein thrombosis</font></a></p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Personal\" rel=\"tag\">Personal</a>\_</div>"

      Hi Stephen,

      <br>You're doing a great job sharing this information. My girlfriend, 26
      years old almost died because of DVT. Doctors are doing a bad job, they
      think DVT is something older people suffer from.

      Cheers for your comments Jaap.

      <br>

      <br>Very sorry to hear about your girlfriend. Glad she is ok now. I would
      be keen to know which hospital she was seen at? the RAH got slated for the
      way in which they treated my sister (they chose to totally ignore their
      own dvt protocol), while the Edinburgh Royal was advised to change
      procedures within the Ombusmans report re my sister.

      <br>

      <br>The problem is, there are no definative tests to determin if a dvt is
      present. therefore, it can NEVER be excluded/ruled out. 

      <br>

      <br>There have been many studies carried out to see if there is a
      relationship between dvt and long haul flights, people are under the
      ellussion a dvt can only form on flights. It would be very interesting to
      know if any of these studied involved looking at if the Factor V gene was
      present. Katies problem was she was taking the Contraceptive pill- this is
      what caused her dvt- not a flight. The most upsetting thing for us is she
      knew exactly what was happening. but no one would listen to her!

      <br>

      <br>We are currently working with NHS24, Scottish Executive and the
      consumer council to arrange for tv,radio and billboards to highlight dvt.
      Unfortunately, the Scot exec are refusing to publish a recent stocktake
      into dvt provisions until after the elections in May! This sort of
      attitude does not help.

      <br>

      <br>Once again thanks for your comments and your support. It is all very
      much appreciated.

      <br>

      I recieved this from Kirsty Miller who's brother who died in hospital as a
      result of DVT

      <br>

      <br>“Didn’t realise that is what they were testing me for.  I got tested
      because Stephen died of a pulmonary embolism which started as a DVT in his
      leg.  Turns out I am high risk too and now cannot be prescribed certain
      medication which I was given previous to his death. So it turns out that
      if Stephen and I had been given this test at birth, he would not have been
      given a clotting agent at hospital and may still be with us and I would
      not have been at extra risk having been given an unsuitable contraceptive
      pill for many years.”

      Kirsty,

      <br>

      <br>I am so sorry to hear about your brother. When I read cases like this
      or hear about them I become very angry. We have been told changes have
      been made after Katies death, however this just proves the point that not
      enough is still being done!

      <br>Your case and others, supports our views that these tests MUST be
      carried out at birth. As you will be aware, the test is a very simple
      blood test, which could be carried out at the same time as all the other
      tests a new born goes through.

      <br>A further point to keep in mind, if a young woman has the Factor V she
      is also at a higher risk of developing a mis-carraige.

      <br>

      <br>Thank you for your support Kirsty by signing the petition. Once again,
      all the support is very much appreciated by my family and I.

      <br>

      <br>Steven

      Just a short update on this. The Glasgow Herald are running the story on
      front page and page 7
      http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1240063.0.0.php

      <br />Will also be on STV news at 6pm tonight. My father and I have just
      been interviewed for it. Doubt it will be very long, but it all helps.

      <br />

      <br />Thanks again

      <br />

      <br />Steven

      Cheers Stuart.

      <br>

      <br>We have been in contact with prof Beasley in NZ and have discussed if
      his research included looking at gene influences. His answer was yes, and
      he will forward his findings once published:-).

      <br>

      <br>Cheers for bringing it to our attention..
