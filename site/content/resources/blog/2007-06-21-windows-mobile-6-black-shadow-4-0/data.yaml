  - "<p>I know that you are not supposed to do it, but I updated my phone to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wmblack.info/\">Windows Mobile 6 Black</a>, specifically Black 4 (Shadow). This is a fantastic ROM and, if you are not that technical, much better than trying to cook your own! It is described as\_a Hybrid OEM of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctytn.html\">HTC Hermes</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.htctouch.com/\">Touch</a> designed specifically for the Hermes. This is good as the current <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.europe.htc.com/products/htctouch.html\">HTC Touch</a> phone does not have 3G or a keyboard, it looks fantastic though. I knew the iPhone would be good for something, pushing HTC to advance the interface!</p>\n<p>I have to say that I enjoy updating my phone. I enjoy cooking my own ROM, I just don't always have the time, so this is a grate option. You still need to know some background to be able to do this, but there is an excellent tutorial from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mrvanx.org\">Mr Vanx</a> called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mrvanx.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=26\">Windows Mobile 6 Black Shadow (4.0)</a>, which gives you step by step advice on what to do, which as this is only the sixth or seventh update I have done, I still needed to read every line thoroughly.</p>\n<p>I can confirm that this OS update worked perfectly (for me) and I even updated my Radio to the latest version( which if you have a\_<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly\">SPV M3100</a> from Orange\_you will know that it needs it). For those that don't know what I am talking about; this is the stage in the update process where you are most likely to \"brick\" you phone, this is a commonly used team for turning your phone into a paperweight. Which would\_suck...</p>\n<p>Having performed a successful update I am happy with the result and will probably keep it at least until some other ROM catches my eye!</p>\n<p><strong>How have your updates gone?</strong></p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/WM6\" rel=\"tag\">WM6</a>\_</div>"
