  - "<p>If, like me you are a fan of Pocked PC mobile phones you will have something like the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_m3100/detail/pay_monthly\">Orange SPV 3100</a>. Like me you will probably not really rate these devices as phones, but it beats carrying multiple technobits in your pocket. You can use it for pictures, email, mp3 (until the <a title=\"Zune MP3 player\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.zune.net\">Zune</a> is released in the UK), reading books (using MS Reader), browsing the web (its not a bad as you would think), and many other things that you require extra software for. What many users of these devices do not know is that Orange does not actually make these phones, it is a company called HTC and they make around 90% of the Smartphones and Pocket PC mobiles. Everyone will have seen the new iPhone that Mac are producing, and although nice to look at, it has a horrendous price tag and you cant get any software for it. Does that remind you of anything, hmmm, any Mac product maybe?</p>\n<p>Well HTC has come up with a first step competitor for the iPhone, and they call it the\_<a title=\"HTC Touch\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.htctouch.com/\">HTC Touch</a>. After viewing the promo website I will definitely be looking for that in my next phone.</p>\n<p>My only question is: <strong>When will this be available on orange?</strong></p><div style=\"padding-bottom: 0px;margin: 0px;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;float: none;padding-top: 0px\" class=\"wlWriterEditableSmartContent\">Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/WM6\" rel=\"tag\">WM6</a>\_<a href=\"http://technorati.com/tags/Answers\" rel=\"tag\">Answers</a>\_</div>"
