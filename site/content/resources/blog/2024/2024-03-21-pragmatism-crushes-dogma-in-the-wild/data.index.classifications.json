However, there is no direct mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor discussion or calculation of SLE, use of historical cycle times, probability-based forecasting, or any explicit alignment with SLE definitions, applications, improvement, or transparency. The audience is practitioners, but not specifically SLE-focused.
