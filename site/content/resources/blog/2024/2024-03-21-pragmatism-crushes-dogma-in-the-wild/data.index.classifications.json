    "reasoning": "The content focuses on practical Scrum use for team adaptability and resilience, emphasizing empiricism, flexibility, and core Scrum elements. Nowhere does it discuss autonomous AI agents, agentic integration, contextual AI, or delivery assisted by AI agency. No mention of modern engineering practices like CI/CD, governance for agents, feedback loops involving agentic learning, or any topics directly tied to 'Agentic Software Delivery.' While the target audience could overlap with practitioners interested in software delivery improvement, there is no conceptual or explicit alignment with agentic delivery as described in the definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content explores pragmatic Scrum usage for adaptability and resilience with no discussion of autonomous agents, contextual AI, or agentic delivery principles. There is no substantive or conceptual fit with Agentic Software Delivery.",
