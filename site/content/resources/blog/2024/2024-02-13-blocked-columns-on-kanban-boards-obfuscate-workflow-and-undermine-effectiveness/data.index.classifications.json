The direct mention of capabilities is weak, and the overall discussion, while insightful on workflow management, does not provide a comprehensive view on developing or embedding enduring competencies that empower teams. The content lacks depth in establishing connections between these practices and the overarching themes of organizational capability, which diminishes alignment with the Capability category.",

    "reasoning": "The content directly addresses the use of Blocked columns on Kanban boards, providing a clear critique about how they can hinder workflow efficiency. This aligns with the principles of Continuous Improvement and Value Delivery, focusing on optimizing processes. The discussion is detailed, explaining the negative implications of using Blocked columns and offering alternative strategies to enhance workflow transparency and accountability. However, while it discusses principles, it mainly circles around practical implications rather than explicitly stating the guiding principles themselves. Hence, it ranks lower in mentions but fairly high in depth and alignment with core principles.",

    "reasoning": "The content centers on the challenges and pitfalls of using Blocked columns on Kanban boards, advocating for alternative strategies such as tagging work items as 'Blocked' instead. While it references reputable Kanban sources and indirectly touches on themes of transparency and workflow efficiency, there is no direct mention or substantive discussion of Service Level Expectation (SLE). SLE-related terms such as cycle time, probability ranges, or explicit ties to forecasting delivery timelines are entirely absent. There is a remote conceptual connection in that better handling of blockers can improve flow and potentially support better predictability (which is SLE-adjacent), but this remains implicit and not the article's main focus. The audience aligns with Agile/Kanban practitioners, but the depth, mentions, and topical focus on SLE are minimal. Therefore, the confidence that this content fits within the category 'Service Level Expectation' is very low.",
