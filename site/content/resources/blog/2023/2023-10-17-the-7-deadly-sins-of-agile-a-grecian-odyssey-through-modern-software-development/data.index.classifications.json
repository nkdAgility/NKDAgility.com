At no point does the content mention, define, or reference Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it discuss any subtopic specific or unique to SLE such as probability-based delivery forecasting, SLE calculation, or its operational role within Kanban or Scrum. While the audience (agile practitioners, coaches, and leaders) slightly overlaps with that for SLE discussions, none of the main ideas, examples, or depth offer anything closely aligned. The minor positive scores in alignment, depth, audience, intent, and signal reflect weak, tangential overlaps in that the post is about Agile team practices and improvement. However, there is zero mention—direct or indirect—of SLE concepts or artifacts. All scores are quite low, with zero for mentions. The confidence score appropriately reflects that this content is fundamentally not about Service Level Expectation at all.",

Analysis discusses accountability, transparency, blame culture, adaptation, resistance to ritual costume, and the necessity of internalising values as system evidence.
