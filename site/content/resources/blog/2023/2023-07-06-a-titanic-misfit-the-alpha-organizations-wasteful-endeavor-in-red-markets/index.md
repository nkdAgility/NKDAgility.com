Under the ruthless canopy of the red market, I find myself staring at the bloated behemoth of an Alpha organisation, huffing and puffing in a vain attempt to keep up with the frenzied pace of the modern world. The Alpha model, once a paragon of order and efficiency in the leisurely blue market era, has now morphed into a lumbering dinosaur, with its hierarchical structures and rigid command and control systems looking out of place in the high-speed, unpredictable red markets.

> Alpha Organizations: Born in the Industrial Age, they are hierarchical and less adaptable.

> Blue Markets: Blue markets refer to the historically stable and slow-paced markets rooted in the Industrial Age.

From where I stand, I see an excessive trail of waste trailing behind these giants – a by-product of their misguided foray into the red markets. Each wasted opportunity, each missed trend, each delayed product launch, heaps more on the pile of squandered resources. Their attempts to rein in the chaotic, whirlwind pace of red markets with their outmoded command and control policies is like trying to tame a wild river with a teaspoon.

The bulk of the waste I observe can be traced back to the speed, or rather lack thereof, at which these Alpha organisations operate. Red markets are volatile; they shift and morph at a breathtaking pace. Yet, Alpha organisations move with the grace of a steam train, heavy and cumbersome. The time they waste in bureaucratic decision-making, pushing papers from one department to another, and getting approval from higher-ups who are far removed from the realities of the market is a luxurious indulgence they cannot afford.

> Beta Organizations: Agile and decentralised, they excel in fast-paced markets.

> Red Markets: Red markets are modern, fast-moving, and complex, driven by constant innovation and fluctuating consumer demands.

Not to mention the innovation wasteland they create, full of ideas and ambitions, bright minds find themselves shackled by the Alpha's obsession with command and control. Creativity is stifled; innovation is snuffed out. The organisation considers their ideas too extreme, uncertain, and untested. And so, they are left untapped and unexplored, wasted.

Then there is the waste of human potential. In an Alpha organisation, most power rests with the top tier. The middle and lower rungs are left to follow orders, their insights and expertise largely overlooked. This has created a vast reservoir of untapped potential that has yet to be utilised. So many workers, so much talent, left on the sidelines, their abilities wasted.

Finally, there's the customer disconnect, perhaps the most egregious form of waste. Alpha organisations, ensconced in their ivory towers, struggle to keep their finger on the market’s pulse. They are often slow to respond to changing customer needs, and their offerings often miss the mark, wasting effort, resources, and lost customers.

Watching the Alpha organisation struggle in red markets feels akin to watching a fish attempt to climb a tree. It is a spectacle of monumental waste – a waste of time, resources, talent, and opportunities. However, all is not lost. I see a ray of hope in the form of Beta organisations, nimble and responsive, perfectly suited to thrive in the complex red markets. They are the future; they are the answer. The sooner we realise this, the better we'll be in reducing the colossal waste we are currently witnessing.
