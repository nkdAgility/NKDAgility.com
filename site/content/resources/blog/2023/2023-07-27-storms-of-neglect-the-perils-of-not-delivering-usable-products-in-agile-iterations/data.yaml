    <p>In light of the importance professional teams place on delivering usable,
    working products, I find myself compelled to address the woes that befall
    teams that need to adhere to this crucial tenet. We understand the need for
    working products; now, let us dissect the perils of straying from this
    righteous path.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tl-dr">TL;DR;</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Neglecting to deliver a usable product at the end of each iteration
    breeds an ecosystem of compounding issues. From eroding trust to technical
    debt and from sluggish adaptability to misaligned expectations, the outcomes
    go from bad to worse. Inspection and adaption should be our guide, helping
    us navigate towards professionalism and quality.</p>

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"
    id="h-what-happens-when-we-ignore-usable-working-product"><strong>What
    happens when we ignore usable working product?</strong></h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Erosion of Trust with Stakeholders:&nbsp;</strong>Imagine walking
    into a store to purchase a laptop, only to be handed the bits and pieces
    with a pat on the back for your ‘future’ computer. The retailer can’t fathom
    why your faith dwindles. Similarly, with each iteration bereft of a usable
    product, the trust vested in you by stakeholders wears thin. Like sand
    slipping through fingers, trust is painfully hard to regain once lost.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Tsunami of Technical Debt:&nbsp;</strong>With each iteration that
    lacks a tangible product, you’re essentially signing IOUs against your
    future. This accrues as Technical Debt – a mammoth wave looming on the
    horizon. The resources required to address this increase exponentially as
    the interest piles on. Continuing down this road with abandon results in
    nothing but pain and suffering for everyone involved.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Sluggish Adaptability – The Quicksand:&nbsp;</strong>In the
    ever-changing landscape of customer needs, adaptability is key. Delivering
    usable increments is akin to the agile footing on uncertain terrain. When
    teams neglect this, it is like walking in quicksand – the more they struggle
    without clear direction, the deeper they sink. The lethargy in adaptation
    will drag them down as the world moves on; without them.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Misaligned Expectations – A Compass Gone Haywire:&nbsp;</strong>A
    usable product at the end of iterations acts as the compass, keeping
    stakeholders and the team aligned. Without this neither you nor your
    stakeholders have any transparency of what is going on and where we have
    arrived. The stakeholders expected one thing but got another, and the chasm
    between them widens with every iteration that the expectations are not
    validated. &nbsp;We often get so far apart that we can’t see how we bridge
    that gap!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Decreased Morale – The Fading Flame:&nbsp;</strong>Morale is the
    lifeblood of creativity and productivity. Delivering a working product is
    the kindling that keeps this fire alive in the team. Being able to see how
    the stakeholders use the product, are engaged by what we are creating, and
    care about the outcomes are the foundation of team morale. If we can’t see
    the stakeholders care about what we are creating, Im not sure why we would
    care…</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Feedback Drought – direction-lessness:</strong>&nbsp;How do we
    know that we are heading in the right direction without feedback. When we
    encounter an obstacle and have to go around, how to we reorientate on the
    direction to go? Our usable working product is like our compass, allowing us
    to orienteer as effectively as we can towards our destination. &nbsp;Without
    it, you’re navigating blind, guessing the direction based on our
    assumptions.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Usable working product, every iteration, including the first, is the
    bedrock upon which we build the pillars of trust, alignment, adaptability,
    and quality. It is the very foundation of inspection and adaptation. Without
    it, we have no transparency, inspection, or adaptation!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Without it, we are not agile.</p>
