The main ideas focus on trust, technical debt, morale, adaptability, stakeholder alignment, and feedback—all central to Agile philosophy, but unrelated to SLE as defined in the scope. The depth reflects a thorough exploration of the chosen topics (e.g., trust, technical debt), but none of these relate to SLE. The intended audience aligns partially with practitioners in Agile contexts, but since it does not address SLE or any teams working specifically with its concept, that score remains low. Most of the content is focused, but the signal-to-noise score is likewise low as none of the focus overlaps the defined category. No penalties for outdated practices or counter-category tone were needed. Overall, this content is irrelevant to the 'Service Level Expectation' category and receives a very low confidence score.",
