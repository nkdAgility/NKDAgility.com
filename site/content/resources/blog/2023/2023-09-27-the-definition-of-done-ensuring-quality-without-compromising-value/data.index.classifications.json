    "reasoning": "The content discusses the Definition of Done (DoD) in the context of Agile practices, placing emphasis on quality, transparency, and adaptability, which align with core Agile principles. It elaborates on how maintaining the sanctity of the DoD ensures value delivery and supports empirical decision-making. The content reflects on the risks of integrating acceptance criteria with the DoD, showcasing an understanding of decision-making in team contexts. However, while it mentions important principles, it does not fully explore each principle's implications or actionable guidance in detail, leading to a moderately high score with room for improvement in depth.",

    "reasoning": "The content mainly discusses the Definition of Done within agile practices, focusing on quality standards and transparency. It briefly mentions concepts related to agile methodology; however, it lacks a deeper exploration of discipline as a structured field of study, which includes shared principles and methodologies that guide professional conduct. While the topic of the Definition of Done is relevant to agile practices, the discussion does not address broader themes of governance, continuous learning, or evolution of disciplines, which are central to the definition of 'Discipline'. Thus, it has low confidence in alignment with the Discipline category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is entirely focused on the Definition of Done (DoD) in agile contexts, exploring issues of quality, transparency, and the relationship with acceptance criteria. There is no mention, direct or indirect, of Service Level Expectation (SLE). Key SLE aspects such as forecasting delivery timelines, probability-based elapsed time ranges, or references to Kanban/Scrum SLE guidance are absent. The audience is agile practitioners, similar to SLE’s target, but since SLE is never broached and the discussion is anchored solely in DoD-related processes, all scoring dimensions are very low. No penalties are applied since there is no criticism, obsolete material, or conflicting tone, just lack of category relevance.",
