    "reasoning": "The content focuses on Product Backlog management in Agile, examining hierarchy, complexity, and the value-centric mindset, but never mentions OKRs, their components, or foundational theory. No objectives, key results, outcome measurement, or explicit tie-ins to John Doerr's 'Measure What Matters' or the OKR framework are present. The audience (Agile practitioners and product managers) overlaps, but the piece remains highly focused on backlog structuring, not on setting or measuring outcomes, strategic alignment, or OKRs. Only tangential and very generic themes (e.g., strategic alignment, value) slightly touch on concepts important to OKRs, but without any explicit connection or application.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of 'Agentic Engineering' are absent. However, there is strong conceptual alignment: the article is centered on maximizing team autonomy, minimizing hierarchical rigidity, fostering cognitive diversity, and emphasizing adaptive, feedback-driven approaches—key tenets of Agentic Engineering. The discussion is deep for Agile agency and autonomy, but AI aspects, DevOps craft, observability, and explicit decision-making frameworks are not present. The content’s intent, audience, and focus are a solid match for practitioners interested in empowerment, self-organization, and complexity within software development, even though explicit agentic terminology is missing.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article aligns conceptually with Agentic Engineering by advocating for team autonomy, adaptability, and empowerment in product backlog management. While it doesn’t explicitly discuss Agentic Engineering or AI agency, its practical focus on decentralisation and human agency in complex environments makes it a relevant—though not complete—fit.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses backlog structure, complexity, team autonomy, and adaptive product development—areas peripherally relevant to Agentic Software Delivery. However, it does not mention AI agents, contextual intelligence, agentic practices, or integration of autonomous systems. The focus is exclusively on human and procedural aspects, without coverage of software agents or proactive intelligence. As such, conceptual alignment and depth are low; the audience (agile practitioners) aligns partially. No relevant signals about agentic systems, agent support, or governance. No penalties: the tone is contemporary, not critical of the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on backlog hierarchy and complexity management in human teams—it never addresses AI agents or agentic delivery concepts. Alignment is weak and fit is partial at best.",
