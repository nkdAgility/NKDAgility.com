    "reasoning": "The content discusses the superficial versus genuine adoption of agile, using a gym membership metaphor. It refers to philosophical and cultural shifts necessary for successful implementation, touching on concepts like collaboration, team diversity, and continuous adaptation. However, it does not directly mention agentic engineering, developer/AI agency, or systemic observability, and it primarily stays within the boundaries of agile transformation. The themes of empowerment and meaningful change overlap with agentic engineering, but references are indirect, with little focus on decentralised decision-making, ethical AI, or DevOps ethos.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article offers a metaphor for genuine agile adoption but lacks direct discussion of agentic engineering, agency, or AI augmentation. Its relevance lies in the themes of real commitment and cultural shift, not in exploring agency-driven engineering practices.",

    "reasoning": "The content draws parallels between superficial agile adoption and unused gym memberships, focusing on genuine commitment in methodology adoption. There are no direct or indirect mentions of agentic principles (no reference to AI agents, agentic delivery, autonomous systems, human-in-the-loop, or contextual intelligence). The main ideas revolve around agile methodology pitfalls and effective implementation, not integration of AI or agentic software delivery. The depth, intent, and topical alignment with the required category are therefore minimal. Audience alignment is somewhat higher since both topics target software delivery professionals, but the specific focus on agentic software delivery is absent. No penalties applied, as there are no outdated or contradictory practices.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on the pitfalls of superficial agile adoption, not agentic software delivery. It lacks discussion of AI agents, autonomy, or contextual integration, so fit with the Agentic Software Delivery category is minimal and mostly tangential.",
