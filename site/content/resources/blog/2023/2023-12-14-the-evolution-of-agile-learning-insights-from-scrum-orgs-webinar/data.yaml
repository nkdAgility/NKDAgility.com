    <p>This week, I participated in a <a href="http://scrum.org/">Scrum.org</a>
    Webinar hosted by Sabrina Love (Scrum.org Product Owner) as well as my
    colleagues, <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/article/edit/7140678898370928640/?author=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAUzPABQyVbo7yoAY7fK8HpaEwXfTa5iCY#"

    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Ballarin</a> to discuss the
    state of learning and how immersive learning is the future of training.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>You can watch the video below to hear what we say, but it's also worth
    framing the problem and the need for change here. I welcome all
    feedback!</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-traditional-training">What is
    Traditional Training?</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Traditional learning is typically delivered over a short period of time,
    mostly with consecutive sessions, sometimes with a little more space. The
    idea in the traditional format is to get the participants to a level of
    understanding/knowledge as quickly as possible.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This typically takes the form of 2 full days of training for your PSM/CSM
    or other agile class.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image {"align":"center","width":"554px","height":"auto"} -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img

    alt="" style="width:554px;height:auto"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>We have "Learn a new Concept" that enables participants to remember the
    content and then follow that up with "Practice with Examples" to enable
    understanding.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image {"id":50989,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img

    alt="" class="wp-image-50989"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This would fulfil the first two stages of Bloom's Taxonomy for Teaching,
    Learning, and Assessment. For some participants, this is enough for them to
    infer greater learnings, but for most, it is not.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Without a substantive change to the participant's mental models, it is
    unlikely that the ideas will stick or the seeds germinate into real
    change.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-immersive-learning">What is
    Immersive Learning?</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Immersive learning is typically delivered over a much longer period and
    may look like a combination of consulting, coaching, and teaching. For
    example, our immersive programs are delivered one half-day weekly for 8-12
    weeks.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Like traditional training, we have "Learn a new Concept" that enables
    participants to remember the content and then follow that up with "Practice
    with Examples" to enable understanding. However, we follow up with an
    "Outcome-based Assignement" that enables the application of things we have
    taught to their real world of work and a "Facilitated Reflection" where they
    can Analyse the outcome.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image
    {"align":"center","id":50988,"width":"480px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"}
    -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-7-720x720.png"
    alt="" class="wp-image-50988" style="width:480px;height:auto"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In effect, we close the learning loop with empiricism. A feedback loop is
    created.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image {"id":50990,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-9-1280x585.png"
    alt="" class="wp-image-50990"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This would then fulfil an additional two stages of Bloom's Taxonomy and
    enable, over time, the last two.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-traditional-not-working">Why is
    traditional not working?</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>While traditional learning has been used for many years in many
    industries, it has a significant and known downside. Most folks only
    remember a fraction of the content presented to them.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This can be augmented with additional homework to enable more connections
    with the content but it has little to no additional value and can at times
    have a negative impact. Every participant is different, and we have
    experimented with providing watching, reading, and writing content... but
    there is little apatite for it with participants and very few partake.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Ultimately very little is remembered in the weeks and months that follow
    a traditional classroom session.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I've been delivering traditional training for over ~13 years, and even
    with augmentations to the format, I've seen limited value for companies.
    There needs to be more than training to enable organisations to get the
    perceived value for most people. This results in an expectations gap where
    they have trained hundreds of people and have not seen things improve or
    change.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>In the 13 years of traditional training, where I would travel onsite, I
    have seen it have a palpable impact only twice... both times, it was
    combined with consulting, coaching... and a little ass-kicking to get things
    moving.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>However, it's only sometimes possible for most trainers to follow up to
    the depth the customer needs. Perhaps you have another training in another
    country next week... but this customer needs more help... (pre-pandemic I
    was travelling 300 days a year with customers. This took little time to
    follow up).</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>As we all moved into the pandemic and things moved online, I got
    breathing space between engagements where I was not in an airport. I was
    able and willing to engage, collaborate, and coach at my desk. But folks
    needed more time. The had their day job, their issues, and the mandatory
    training course from last week or last month needed to be more
    interesting.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>I even offered additional consulting for every student, cumulative for
    companies with private classes, and still, I am still waiting for something
    to happen. Less than 5% used it, and I could not get above 6% even with
    follow-up.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p><strong>Queue immersive formats.</strong></p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"
    id="h-why-is-immersive-always-a-better-option">Why is Immersive Always a
    Better option?</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>By bringing the classroom content into the workplace and having
    participants try or do things from the learning in that environment we have
    a chance to close the feedback loop and have participants not just gain
    knowledge and understanding, but also be able to apply, and analyse the
    outcomes.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image
    {"align":"center","id":50987,"width":"448px","height":"auto","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"}
    -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-6-720x720.png"
    alt="" class="wp-image-50987" style="width:448px;height:auto"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This would enable double-loop learning, where participants can apply the
    ideas learned in their own environment and then come back around and make
    real, lasting changes to their mental model and the mental model of those
    around them in their environment.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Even this is a rather simplistic linear view, and you could imagine
    multiple instances of the image above stacked on top of each other and the
    feedback from the "Outcome -based assignment" that is applied in the
    workplace not only goes from the previous session to the next, but also to
    traverse the instances of the sessions to reinforce and continuously update
    the learning loops.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>For example, a participant may try something after session one and then
    ask to participate in exploratory learning of the outcomes, as they
    continuously happen in sessions 2, 3, 4, etc.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:quote -->

    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>My attraction to immersive classes stems from contrasting experiences:
    the lasting impact of a detailed MongoDB course, complete with weekly
    homework and a final exam, versus the fleeting memory of a two-day crash
    course in team management, which left me overwhelmed and fatigued. These
    experiences have shaped my preference for immersive learning.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>

    <!-- /wp:quote -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>This continuous reinforcement and engagement, both from the qualified
    expert instructor and the other participant peers engaged in similar
    outcomes, multiplies the effect of the training and embeds new mental models
    in all of the participants.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:image {"id":50986,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->

    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img
    src="https://nkdagility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-5-912x720.png"
    alt="" class="wp-image-50986"/></figure>

    <!-- /wp:image -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>For double-loop learning to be effective, participants need to be able to
    make a substantive change to their mental models as they progress through
    the content. This deeper change and learning is enabled by the application
    in the workplace and the analysis of what happened and why that comes from
    the "facilitated reflection".</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Double-loop learning is not guaranteed by participating in immersive
    learning, but it does enable it.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

    <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-so-is-traditional-learning-dead">So, is
    traditional learning dead?</h3>

    <!-- /wp:heading -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Traditional two-day classes are of the past, and immersive multi-week
    classes are of the future. That is not to say that tradition is dead; it
    will be around for a long time as we transition, but we must transition.</p>

    <!-- /wp:paragraph -->


    <!-- wp:paragraph -->

    <p>Immersive takes what we learned teaching traditional classes, in
    Scrumorg's case, for 13 years, and adds more value, learning, and
    opportunities for change.</p>
