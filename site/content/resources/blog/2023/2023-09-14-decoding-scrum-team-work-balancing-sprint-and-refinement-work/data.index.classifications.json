There is no direct mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor any reference to its calculation, use, or purpose as defined in Agile, Scrum, or Kanban. Key SLE conceptsâ€”such as elapsed time ranges, probability, or its role in predictability and continuous improvementâ€”are entirely absent. The content aligns only weakly in audience (Scrum practitioners) but is otherwise misaligned with the strict scope: it's not about forecasting delivery timelines, SLE analysis, or SLE-driven adaptation.
