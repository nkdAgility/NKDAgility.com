# OKR Guide

A Social Discipline for Shared Focus, Measurable Contribution, and Strategic Learning
**June 2025 Edition**

---

## Purpose of the OKR Guide

**The purpose of this guide is to enable organisations to use OKRs as a discipline for managing by contribution.*- It offers a practical, outcome-oriented approach to focusing effort, aligning intent, and learning from results. This guide supports teams and leaders in shaping shared direction, measuring progress meaningfully, and using OKRs not as a formality, but as a living system for navigating complexity and improving performance.

## Definition of OKRs

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)*- are a lightweight discipline for defining and testing what matters most. Objectives express strategic intent. Key Results make that intent observable and falsifiable. Together, they enable individuals and teams to align around purpose, focus their efforts, and evaluate whether their work leads to meaningful outcomes.&#x20;

OKRs consist of:

- **Objectives**: Qualitative, inspiring, directional goals that articulate where we want to go.
- **Key Results**: Quantitative, time-bound measures that define how we know we are making progress.

They are not project plans. They are a lightweight mechanism for aligning strategic intention with measurable progress.

## Principles Behind OKRs

The OKR framework rests on four irreducible first principles shaped by Peter Drucker, Andy Grove, and John Doerr: **Clarity of Purpose**, **Alignment**, **Measurement**, and **Accountability**.

- **Clarity of Purpose** - OKRs distil focus. Drucker advocated for shared and public objectives to unify effort. Grove operationalised this by insisting on fewer, well-scoped goals with clear metrics. Doerr reinforced the idea that inspiration must be grounded in execution; objectives must be motivational but paired with measurable key results.

- **Alignment** - OKRs promote shared direction. Drucker’s early MBO stressed aligning individual contributions with enterprise-wide goals. Grove extended this with cascading OKRs and bottom-up participation. Doerr championed organisational transparency, making every OKR visible to foster unity across teams.

- **Measurement** - OKRs insist on observable outcomes. Drucker warned against managing by intuition. Grove introduced Key Results as measurable indicators of progress. Doerr summarised this as "measure what matters"—metrics aren’t optional, they define what success looks like.

- **Accountability**  - OKRs build a system of ownership and follow-through. Drucker envisioned self-management through mutually agreed-upon goals. Grove made OKRs a recurring practice of review and adjustment, decoupled from compensation. Doerr extended this with tools for tracking and public scoring, reinforcing commitment through visibility.

These principles enable OKRs to become a management tool for aligning purposeful effort with measurable performance. They shift the organisation away from static reporting and toward active contribution, feedback, and course correction, making objectives a means for directing energy and learning, not documenting activity. 

## OKRs and Strategic Planning

**OKRs do not replace strategic plans or roadmaps—they connect intent to action.*- They express strategic priorities as working hypotheses, helping teams focus their energy on what matters now and test whether it produces the outcomes the organisation needs.

In practice, OKRs give form to strategy by:

- Expressing enterprise priorities as shared, quarterly Objectives.
- Using KPIs as reference points, not destinations.
- Distilling roadmaps into outcomes rather than outputs.

In mature organisations, OKRs become a disciplined way to manage by contribution. They help teams navigate ambiguity, inspect performance, and adjust course without losing sight of the goal..

## Structural Enablers for Managing by Objectives

For OKRs to function as a management tool rather than a procedural formality, the organisation must first establish the conditions that allow teams to contribute meaningfully to enterprise performance. These are not merely technical prerequisites, but structural commitments to clarity, responsibility, and decentralised control. Each condition below supports the ability of individuals and teams to manage by objectives and act on shared purpose.

1. **Clear Organisational Vision and Goals*- – A shared vision is the starting point for managing by objectives. Teams cannot align around outcomes without knowing what matters most. Strategic clarity enables teams to focus their contributions on what drives enterprise performance.

2. **Strong Leadership Support and Sponsorship*- – Leadership must do more than approve OKRs; they must model their use. When leaders set and reflect on OKRs themselves, they legitimise the system as a tool for direction, performance, and learning.

3. **Hypothesis-Driven Thinking*- – Objectives should not be treated as certainties. They are assumptions about what actions will create meaningful outcomes. OKRs function best when each one is seen as a strategic hypothesis to be tested and refined based on evidence.

4. **Lean Thinking and Flow Awareness*- – OKRs depend on a system that delivers value without waste or overburden. OKRs help surface where strategic assumptions about value delivery break down, by making it clear when intended outcomes fail to materialise. This enables ongoing inspection of system performance and supports adaptation where needed.

5. **Agile and Adaptable Work Culture*- – To manage by objectives, teams must be trusted to self-correct. OKRs require short feedback loops, freedom to pivot, and decentralised ownership of outcomes. Rigidity undermines initiative; adaptability sustains it.

These conditions are not optional. They form the structural foundation that determines whether OKRs serve as a tool for purposeful contribution and feedback, or collapse into ritualised compliance. Without them, OKRs lose their capacity to guide informed action and measurable performance.

## Areas of Responsibility and Contribution

Every function that supports OKRs must be understood not merely by title or process responsibility, but by the contribution it makes to organisational performance. The roles defined here are not hierarchical positions or checklists, but expressions of functional responsibility. Each exists to help the organisation translate strategy into meaningful outcomes, guided by shared direction, measurable progress, and continuous learning. These are not job titles but areas of responsibility that shape how OKRs are defined, tracked, and adapted over time.

### OKR Coach

The OKR Coach supports the adoption and evolution of OKRs across the organisation. They mentor OKR Leads and Champions, ensure consistency in implementation, and promote discipline in writing and evaluating OKRs. While not involved in the day-to-day management of OKRs, the coach stewards coherence and learning across teams. They help surface and navigate constraints, challenge unexamined assumptions, and encourage the organisation to treat OKRs as an evolving social system, not a fixed method to be applied uniformly. Their role is to provoke reflective practice, not enforce standardisation.

**What OKR Coaches enable:**

- Mentoring OKR Leads and Champions in sense-making and adaptive OKR use
- Helping teams improve their ability to define meaningful, measurable, and strategically aligned OKRs
- Enabling teams to reflect across cycles to improve outcome focus and adaptive capacity
- Provoking thoughtful challenge to rigid patterns that inhibit learning or ownership
- Cultivating feedback loops that promote organisational learning
- Making invisible blockers and organisational constraints visible
- Mentoring OKR Leads and Champions in sense-making and adaptive OKR use
- Supporting teams in writing, reviewing, and evolving effective OKRs
- Facilitating systemic reflection across cycles and domains
- Challenging rigid or compliance-driven OKR behaviours
- Cultivating feedback loops that promote organisational learning
- Making invisible blockers and organisational constraints visible

### OKR Lead

The OKR Lead drives implementation of OKRs as a shared tool for strategic clarity and adaptive alignment. Their role is to support the use of OKRs as a lightweight, evidence-oriented way of expressing intent, uncovering systemic barriers, and enabling outcome-oriented decision-making. They maintain the rhythm and discipline of the OKR cycle, help teams interpret learning across domains, and support leadership in connecting strategic planning to actionable, measurable outcomes.

**What OKR Leads make happen:**

- Supporting cross-team and executive alignment of strategic themes
- Maintaining predictable rhythm to support clarity, accountability, and feedback
- Enabling OKR Champions through training, guidance, tools, and coaching
- Ensuring visibility into whether OKRs align with strategy and expose system-level gaps
- Identifying systemic misalignments and constraints using OKRs as signals
- Turning OKR results into strategy-shaping insight through deliberate feedback mechanisms
- Supporting cross-team and executive alignment of strategic themes
- Coordinating the OKR planning and review cadence
- Enabling OKR Champions through training, guidance, tools, and coaching
- Monitoring organisational OKR coherence and health
- Identifying systemic misalignments and constraints using OKRs as signals
- Facilitating learning loops that connect outcomes to strategy

### OKR Champion

The OKR Champion owns the OKR process at the team or department level. They facilitate workshops, check-ins, reviews, and retrospectives. Champions promote transparency, enable teams to be engaged in their OKRs, and escalate blockers. They serve as operational anchors for the OKR cadence, ensuring the process remains lightweight, disciplined, and adaptable. They coach the team on applying OKR principles without adding ceremony.

**How OKR Champions create impact:**

- Enabling consistent inspection of progress, learning, and alignment through regular cadence
- Supporting teams in writing and refining OKRs
- Helping the team continuously use OKRs to guide decisions and focus
- Escalating unresolved impediments or misalignments
- Supporting the team in interpreting OKRs as shared direction, not assigned targets
- Facilitating the team’s OKR cadence, including workshops and reviews
- Supporting teams in writing and refining OKRs
- Keeping OKRs visible and relevant throughout the cycle
- Escalating unresolved impediments or misalignments
- Reinforcing alignment and ownership across the team

### Team Leader

Team Leaders provide the strategic direction for their teams. They ensure that team OKRs reflect organisational goals and that OKRs become part of day-to-day conversations. Leaders coach team members, remove impediments, and model accountability by sharing and tracking their own OKRs. They reinforce focus and discipline in execution.

**Team Leaders are responsible for:**

- Ensuring team-level OKRs align with organisational intent
- Making OKRs the basis for team planning, prioritisation, and evidence-based adjustments
- Coaching team members in goal definition and alignment
- Removing blockers that inhibit OKR delivery
- Demonstrating use of OKRs as a personal and team accountability tool
- Ensuring team-level OKRs align with organisational intent
- Integrating OKRs into regular planning, delivery, and learning rhythms
- Coaching team members in goal definition and alignment
- Removing blockers that inhibit OKR delivery
- Modelling transparency and discipline by maintaining their own OKRs

### Team Member

Team Members contribute actively to defining and delivering OKRs. They participate in workshops, provide updates during check-ins, and assist in evaluating outcomes during reviews. Each team member owns their role in achieving shared goals and contributes insights during retrospectives to improve the system.

**Team Members contribute by:**

- Contributing to the creation of meaningful and measurable OKRs
- Proactively communicating OKR progress to support shared visibility and adaptation
- Taking initiative to surface issues that affect team outcomes
- Using reviews to understand impact and improve personal and team contribution
- Taking ownership of individual and shared OKR outcomes
- Contributing to the creation of meaningful and measurable OKRs
- Providing regular and honest updates on key result progress
- Identifying and raising blockers or risks to delivery
- Participating in reviews and retrospectives with insight and feedback
- Taking ownership of individual and shared OKR outcomes

## Events in the OKR Cycle

The OKR cycle typically follows a quarterly cadence, although other cadences may be more optimal in some circumstances, and is built around four recurring events. Each event serves a distinct purpose in enabling alignment, focus, adaptation, and improvement throughout the cycle.

| Event         | Timing          | Purpose                             | Facilitated By         |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Definition    | Start of cycle  | Set direction and shared commitment | OKR Lead + Champion    |
| Check-ins     | Weekly/Biweekly | Monitor progress, adapt execution   | OKR Champion           |
| Review        | End of cycle    | Evaluate achievement and learn      | Team Leader + Champion |
| Retrospective | End of cycle    | Inspect and improve the OKR system  | OKR Champion + Team    |

### **Definition**

This event marks the beginning of the cycle. It brings teams together to define a small number of clear, strategic objectives aligned with organisational priorities. Each objective is paired with 2–4 measurable key results. The OKR Lead ensures strategic alignment, while the OKR Champion facilitates the session, and all team members actively participate in shaping their commitments.

The Definition event should follow a structured format similar to:

1. **Contextualise*- – Set the strategic context.
2. **Reflect*- – Assess the current state.
3. **Envision*- – Explore aspirational futures.
4. **Focus*- – Select 1–3 objectives.
5. **Quantify*- – Define Key Results using the standard format.
6. **Commit*- – Agree as a team and publish transparently.

A successful Definition event produces a coherent set of OKRs with clarity of purpose, strategic alignment, and strong ownership across the team. An example workshop is available in the appendix.

### **Check-ins**

Check-ins occur on a weekly or biweekly basis to monitor progress against key results. These events enable teams to adapt execution, surface blockers early, and maintain accountability. The OKR Champion leads the cadence, encouraging honest status updates and evidence-backed reporting. Team Leaders use check-ins to coach, re-focus priorities, and reinforce alignment. These are not reporting meetings; they are tactical forums for learning, problem-solving, and maintaining momentum.

OKRs are a living system. Use frequent check-ins to:

- Inspect progress.
- Celebrate learning.
- Adapt expectations based on evidence.
- Re-align if strategic intent shifts.

### **Review**

Held at the end of each cycle, the Review evaluates the actual outcomes against each objective and its key results. It answers: What was achieved? What wasn’t? And what can we learn from the results? The OKR Champion and Team Leader co-facilitate this session. The team scores each key result and reflects on performance. The Review event informs strategic planning, influences future objectives, and drives organisational learning. Accountability here is about honesty and clarity, not blame.

**OKR Scoring and Reflection**

Scoring Key Results at the end of each cycle is essential for generating insight and driving learning. Common scoring systems include:

- **0.0 to 1.0 scale*- – Google’s standard: 1.0 = fully achieved; 0.7 = strong progress; below 0.4 = off-track.
- **Traffic light*- – Green (on track), Yellow (at risk), Red (off-track).
- **Binary*- – Done / Not Done (suitable for binary results only).

Each team should select a consistent scoring model, apply it objectively, and use it as input for retrospective learning, rather than performance management. Teams should also document lessons learned during scoring to inform future cycles.

### **Retrospective**

This final event inspects the OKR process itself. It focuses on how well the team defined, tracked, and executed their OKRs. Were the objectives focused? Were the key results measurable? Did the cadence support delivery? Everyone participates in evaluating the system, and improvements are captured for the next cycle. The OKR Champion ensures a safe, constructive discussion, and the Team Leader supports adoption of agreed-upon improvements. This event reinforces continuous improvement and prevents stagnation.

Retrospectives help refine the OKR process over time, improving clarity, engagement, and outcomes.

## Writing Effective OKRs

OKRs are hypothesis-driven. Each Objective is a strategic bet, and each Key Result is a measurable test of whether that bet is paying off. Writing strong OKRs means making those bets explicit, verifiable, and time-bound.

Writing effective OKRs requires rigour, intent, and a shared understanding of purpose. Poorly formed OKRs undermine alignment and dilute impact. This section outlines how to write Objectives and Key Results that are both inspirational and measurable.

### Objectives

Objectives articulate direction. They are concise, qualitative, and designed to inspire commitment. A well-written objective provides clarity of purpose and drives focus.

- They describe a desired state or strategic outcome, not a task or activity.
- Each objective should align with higher-level organisational goals and reflect team accountability.
- Objectives must be limited in number (typically no more than three per team) to maintain focus and coherence.
- The language used should be action-oriented, grounded in relevance to the team, and specific to the quarter.

### Key Results

Key Results define evidence of success. They are objective, time-bound, and measurable.

- Each key result should quantify progress toward the objective. If it cannot be measured, it should not be a key result.
- The preferred structure is: `Verb + Metric from X to Y by [Date]`. This format makes both baseline and target explicit.
- Key results must reflect outcomes, not outputs or activities. Delivery of a feature is not a result; the value it enables is.
- Use 2–4 key results per objective. Fewer may lack clarity; more risks fragmentation and loss of meaning.

Well-formed OKRs are simple, clear, and directional. They provide a shared contract for value delivery and a baseline for meaningful review. Rewriting, challenging, and refining OKRs is expected and encouraged. The goal is not to generate volume, but precision.

## Sub-Optimal OKR Practices to Avoid

Avoiding common pitfalls is essential for maintaining the integrity and impact of OKRs. Below are frequent sub-optimal practices that undermine alignment, weaken accountability, and reduce the effectiveness of OKRs:

- **Task Lists Disguised as Key Results*- – Key Results should reflect measurable outcomes, not a to-do list. Replace vague activities with quantifiable evidence of change.

- **Too Many OKRs*- – Attempting to cover everything undermines focus. Limit objectives to the vital few and resist the urge to track every possible metric.

- **Top-Down Mandates*- – Imposing OKRs without team involvement leads to resistance and low ownership. A collaborative definition builds clarity and commitment.

- **Misalignment*- – OKRs that don’t connect to broader strategy create confusion. Ensure vertical and horizontal alignment across the organisation.

- **No Regular Check-ins*- – OKRs set and forgotten are ineffective. Frequent inspection and adaptation are critical for learning and progress.

- **Vague or Unmeasurable KRs*- – Ambiguity erodes accountability. If a key result can’t be objectively scored, it needs rework.

- **Tying OKRs to Compensation*- – Linking OKRs to pay or performance ratings discourages ambition and honesty. Keep OKRs aspirational, not evaluative.

- **Binary Thinking*- – All-or-nothing key results miss nuance. Use scaled outcomes or multiple indicators where appropriate to better reflect reality.

## Final Words

OKRs are not a silver bullet. They are a collaborative discipline. When used with rigour, transparency, and commitment, they become a social and quantitative system for aligning intent with action. Start with clarity. Stay with it through learning.

## Appendix A: Open Space Technology for OKR Collaboration

Open Space Technology (OST) is a facilitation approach that supports self-organisation, emergent priorities, and rapid group learning, making it well-suited for use alongside OKRs. Introduced by Harrison Owen and applied widely through OpenSpace Agility, OST enables cross-functional collaboration in complex and time-sensitive environments.

OST is particularly powerful when the following conditions are present:

- A topic of urgent strategic importance
- A diverse group of stakeholders with differing views
- High complexity, potential for conflict, or interdependence

### Core Characteristics

Open Space requires very little upfront structure. Instead of imposing a pre-defined agenda, participants co-create their own. The result is high engagement and personal ownership over outcomes. The format typically includes:

- A clear and compelling theme
- A voluntary, committed group
- A large, open space with movable chairs and breakout areas
- A blank agenda wall and a flexible process structure

### The Event Structure

Open Space events typically unfold across the following stages:

- **Opening*- – Participants gather in a circle. The facilitator introduces the theme and invites anyone to propose topics for discussion.
- **Agenda Setting*- – Individuals write their proposed sessions on paper, announce them to the group, and post them on the agenda wall.
- **Marketplace*- – Attendees choose which sessions to attend based on interest and relevance.
- **Sessions*- – Multiple parallel conversations happen, each self-managed by participants.
- **Evening News*- – Informal summaries of learning and outcomes are shared.
- **Closing*- – A reflection circle where participants share takeaways and proposed next steps.

### Key Principles

Open Space runs on four principles and one law:

1. **Whoever comes are the right person**
2. **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have**
3. **Whenever it starts is the right time**
4. **When it’s over, it’s over**

**The Law of Two Feet**: If you find yourself in a situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet to go somewhere else where you can.

### Open Space + OKRs

OST is an ideal companion to OKR Definition or Reset events, especially in organisations:

- Beginning a major transformation
- Dealing with fragmentation or poor engagement
- Seeking to decentralise strategic ownership

You can use Open Space:

- To generate themes and strategic topics for future OKRs
- As a mid-cycle alignment and issue-surfacing mechanism
- For large-scale retrospectives at the end of OKR cycles
- To build a sense of shared ownership across boundaries

Because participants choose the conversations that matter to them, Open Space surfaces hidden tensions, identifies emerging opportunities, and reinforces the principle of outcome ownership. It’s not just a facilitation method; it’s a social technology that unlocks collective intelligence and aligns diverse teams without prescription.

OST and OKRs work together to strengthen collaboration, autonomy, and focus, enabling your organisation to adapt in real time while staying strategically aligned.
