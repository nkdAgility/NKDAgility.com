### Purpose of the EBM Guide

Organizations exist to achieve something they believe they, uniquely, can achieve. They express this purpose in various ways, at different levels:

- **Vision Statement**: the change the organization wants to make in the world.
- **Mission Statement**: why the organization is uniquely capable of achieving the vision.
- **Goals**: established at different levels and timescales to help realize the mission and vision.

Without goals, mission and vision remain abstract. Without an effective mission and vision, goals lack compelling purpose—especially under uncertainty.

This guide defines EBM and its core concepts.

### Definition of Evidence-Based Management

Evidence-Based Management (EBM) is a framework that helps people, teams, and organizations make better-informed decisions using intentional experimentation and feedback.

### EBM Helps Organizations Achieve Their Goals in a Complex World

Complex problems lack easy solutions. Organizations must make progress through small, intentional steps. Each step involves inspecting the results and adapting accordingly (see Figure 1).

EBM focuses on three goal levels:

- **Strategic Goals**: long-term, aspirational objectives with high uncertainty.
- **Intermediate Goals**: measurable indicators of progress toward strategic goals.
- **Immediate Tactical Goals**: current focus for improvement efforts.

Progress involves forming hypotheses about improvements, testing them, and adapting based on evidence. This is empiricism in action.

_Figure 1: Reaching strategic goals requires experimenting, inspecting, and adapting._

### Setting Goals

Organizations must define measurable goals and make them transparent.

**Example: infectious disease response**

- **Strategic Goal**: eradicate the disease’s effects (measured by illness severity).
- **Intermediate Goal**: successful vaccine trial.
- **Immediate Tactical Goals**: isolate symptoms, evaluate therapy, sequence DNA.

Strategic Goals focus on outcomes for people, which EBM calls _Unrealized Value_—the satisfaction gap between desired and current experience.

### Understanding What is Valuable

Measurements fall into five categories:

- **Inputs**: resources spent.
- **Activities**: work done.
- **Outputs**: what is produced.
- **Outcomes**: benefits experienced by users.
- **Impacts**: organisational results (e.g. revenue).

Outcomes drive value. Activities and outputs are easy to measure but insufficient.

### Making Progress in Small Steps

Understanding your _Current State_ is the first step. The _Experiment Loop_ (see Figure 1) supports progress by:

1. **Forming a hypothesis**
2. **Running experiments**
3. **Inspecting results**
4. **Adapting goals and approach**

### Hypotheses, Experiments, Features, and Requirements

Every feature or requirement is a hypothesis about value. Experiments test these hypotheses without building the full solution. EBM makes this process explicit and transparent.

### EBM Uses Key Value Areas (KVAs)

KVAs offer perspectives on value:

- **Unrealized Value (UV)**: future opportunities
- **Current Value (CV)**: current outcomes
- **Time-to-Market (T2M)**: delivery speed
- **Ability to Innovate (A2I)**: innovation capability

![Key Value Areas](https://scrumorg-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/drupal/s3fs-public/styles/cke_media_resize_large/public/2024-05/EBM-KVA%20Diagram%204.12.2024.jpg?itok=-KlrFK2C)

_Figure 2: Key Value Areas provide lenses to examine improvement opportunities._

### Current Value (CV)

Measures current value delivered:

1. Customer happiness
2. Employee engagement
3. Stakeholder satisfaction

**Example**: High profit but low satisfaction may indicate underlying risks.

### Unrealized Value (UV)

Measures future potential:

1. Can more value be created?
2. Is it worth the risk?
3. Should we invest to capture it?

**Example**: Early product with high UV but low CV may warrant investment.

### Ability to Innovate (A2I)

Measures capacity to deliver new capabilities:

1. What impedes innovation?
2. What prevents customers from benefiting?

**Example**: Poor quality, slow decision-making, or tech debt reduce A2I.

### Time-to-Market (T2M)

Measures responsiveness:

1. How fast can we learn?
2. How fast can we adapt?
3. How fast can we test with users?

**Example**: Smaller releases and less waste improve T2M.

### Inspecting and Adapting

Use KVA data to inspect outcomes and adjust goals. Tactical Goals should reduce UV and improve CV. A2I and T2M support the organisation's ability to reach those goals.

### End Note

Evidence-Based Management is a holistic approach. Partial implementation is not EBM.
