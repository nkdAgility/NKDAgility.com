## Kendall Framework Purpose & Definition

The Kendall Framework is a system of work for thinking about AI. Its single purpose is to answer: **“Where do we start with AI?”** It provides clarity and discipline in approaching AI adoption, ensuring organisations focus on problems and outcomes rather than technology trends. It does not prescribe specific tools or architectures. Instead, it directs organisations to identify, articulate, and prioritise AI opportunities through problem‑first, context‑driven, and collaborative practices. It emphasises flow of information, decisions, and value, guided by empirical inspection and adaptation.

The Kendall Framework is not intended to represent a complete system. It defines boundaries and focus, and it expects to be complemented by other practices that ensure delivery discipline, modern engineering, effective team collaboration, and observability.

## Kendall Application

The Kendall Framework can be applied by organisations, teams, entrepreneurs, and governments seeking clarity on how to approach AI adoption. It is suitable for any domain where complex challenges require principled prioritisation, flow‑based thinking, and structured learning.

## First Principles of the Kendall Framework

The first principles of the Kendall Framework are foundational truths:

1. **Problem Before Solution** – AI begins by addressing real, observable problems rather than chasing technology.
2. **Context Creates Meaning** – Defined context turns generic intelligence into purposeful outcomes.
3. **Pull Context at the Rate of Demand** – Context flows into AI systems as needed, driven by actual demand rather than anticipatory accumulation.
4. **Clarity of Language** – Precise language is the raw material of AI and management alike.
5. **Accountability Anchored in Stakeholders** – AI must serve clearly identified stakeholders.
6. **Boundaries Enable Trust** – Values and constraints ensure dependable and ethical AI use.
7. **Structure Builds Reliability** – Structured inputs form the basis for sustainable outcomes.
8. **Collaboration Sustains Value** – Collective ownership and knowledge flows enable value delivery.
9. **Continuous Improvement** – The inspect‑and‑adapt habit that ensures learning, flow, and resilience.

## How It Works

The Kendall Framework applies a problem‑first approach to AI. It integrates management clarity, systems thinking, and iterative improvement to ensure adoption creates measurable value.

- **Problem‑First**: Focus on the most pressing problems, not technology.
- **Role of Context**: Define purpose, scope, and constraints so solutions align with organisational goals.
- **Pull‑Based Context Flow**: Context is pulled into AI systems at the rate of actual demand, avoiding waste from excessive accumulation and ensuring relevance.
- **Collaboration**: Build shared understanding and collective ownership across disciplines.
- **Iteration**: Govern adoption by empirical inspection and adaptation.
- **Discovery Cadence**: Hold regular sessions (quarterly or half‑yearly) to surface problems, adapt, and rebalance flow of priorities.

## Kendall Accountabilities

The Kendall Framework defines accountabilities. Each may be fulfilled by one person or many, provided leadership and responsibility are clear. These are accountabilities, not job titles or roles. They represent areas of responsibility that enable the framework to function effectively.

### AI Leadership Accountability Structure

The framework establishes a clear accountability hierarchy for AI adoption:

- **Context Curator** – Provides strategic oversight across multiple problem domains
  - **Problem Owner** – Accountable for specific problem areas and their context needs
    - **Context Owner** – Manages context for specific AI instances

This structure scales to support multiple problem domains. For example, a Context Curator may oversee several Problem Owners, each responsible for distinct problem domains. Each Problem Owner coordinates multiple Context Owners who manage context for individual AI implementations within that problem domain.

### Kendall Coach

The **Kendall Coach** is accountable for helping the organisation understand and apply the framework. They mentor Context Curators, Problem Owners, Context Owners, and AI Leads, ensure consistency, and promote discipline in defining and refining opportunities and context. They do not manage day‑to‑day AI work but steward coherence and learning across teams.

They enable:

- Mentoring accountabilities in adaptive use of the framework
- Helping teams define meaningful and strategically aligned opportunities
- Reflection across discovery cycles to improve outcomes
- Challenging rigid patterns that inhibit learning
- Surfacing systemic constraints and impediments to flow
- Cultivating feedback loops for organisational learning

### Context Curator

The **Context Curator** holds strategic accountability for context coherence across multiple problem domains. They ensure that context developed for different AI implementations remains aligned with organisational strategy and maintains consistency. Rather than managing operational details, they provide oversight that enables Problem Owners to work effectively within a coherent context landscape.

They enable:

- Strategic alignment of context across problem domains
- Oversight of Problem Owners and their context strategies
- Identification of cross-domain patterns and reusable context
- Resolution of conflicts or overlaps between problem domains
- Connection between strategic intent and context development
- Escalation of systemic context challenges to leadership

### Problem Owner

The **Problem Owner** is accountable for a specific problem domain and the context strategy required to address it effectively with AI. They coordinate Context Owners working on related AI implementations within their domain, ensuring context development remains focused on solving the identified problem. They maintain clarity on problem definition, stakeholder needs, and outcome measures.

They make happen:

- Clear articulation of the problem and its boundaries
- Coordination of Context Owners within their problem domain
- Alignment of context work with problem-solving goals
- Visibility into progress and impediments across their domain
- Prioritisation of context needs based on problem urgency
- Translation of problem insights into context requirements
- Feedback to Context Curator on strategic patterns and needs

### AI Lead

The **AI Lead** drives disciplined use of the Opportunity Backlog as a tool for strategic clarity and adaptive alignment. They support expressing intent through opportunities, uncover systemic barriers, and enable outcome‑oriented decisions. They maintain rhythm around review cycles, help interpret learning, and connect strategic direction to measurable initiatives.

They make happen:

- Cross‑team and executive alignment of strategic themes
- Predictable rhythm for clarity, accountability, and feedback
- Enabling Context Curators, Problem Owners, and Context Owners through guidance and coaching
- Visibility into whether opportunities align with strategy
- Identification of systemic misalignments using opportunities as signals
- Turning opportunity results into strategy‑shaping insight through deliberate feedback

### Context Controller

The **Context Controller** is accountable for the disciplined assembly, traceability, and publishing of context for AI. A dedicated Context Controller is required for each instance of AI usage. They ensure that context is collected, structured, and versioned so it remains accurate, auditable, and valuable throughout its lifecycle. They apply lean principles by enabling pull‑based context flow, delivering context as demand emerges rather than accumulating speculatively.

They create impact by:

- Assembling and curating context into coherent and usable blocks on demand
- Maintaining traceability of context sources, changes, and dependencies
- Publishing updated context on a clear cadence for inspection and alignment
- Supporting teams in refining and validating context contributions
- Ensuring context flows at the rate of actual demand, limiting work in progress to maintain focus and relevance
- Escalating unresolved inconsistencies or context gaps
- Coaching teams to use context as a shared reference point for decisions and focus

### Context Owner(s)

The **Context Owner(s)** are accountable for lean management of context for specific AI instances within a problem domain. A Context Owner is needed for each instance of AI usage. Working under the coordination of a Problem Owner, they facilitate capture, refinement, and maintenance of context, ensuring it remains relevant and valuable. Owners promote transparency, enable engagement, escalate blockers, and coach teams to apply context principles without excess ceremony. They embody pull‑based thinking by ensuring context is drawn from sources only when needed, maintaining flow and avoiding waste.

They create impact by:

- Enabling inspection of context, learning, and alignment on cadence
- Supporting teams in writing and refining context blocks as demand signals emerge
- Helping teams use context to guide decisions and focus
- Limiting context work in progress to what is immediately valuable, preventing speculative accumulation
- Escalating unresolved impediments or misalignments
- Supporting teams in interpreting context as shared direction

## Events

### Opportunity & Context Sourcing Event

This event aligns leaders and teams on the most effective problems to solve with AI. It functions as a feedback loop in the system of work, closing the gap between strategy, evidence, and adaptation. It emphasises clarity, discovery, and evidence‑informed prioritisation. By surfacing demand signals, this event enables pull‑based context flow and ensures context development remains aligned with actual needs.

Outcomes include:

- Alignment with objectives and context
- A prioritised set of opportunities
- Clear direction for an AI roadmap
- Evidence review of outcomes against intent
- Learning orientation, treating surprises as signals for adaptation
- Identification of demand signals that trigger context creation or refinement
- Feedback loops into the Opportunity Backlog, Context Repository, and Roadmap

The Kendall Coach and AI Lead co‑facilitate to ensure balance and discipline. Held on a regular cadence (quarterly or half‑yearly), it inspects and adapts objectives based on evidence and rebalances flow of priorities.

## Artifacts

### Opportunity Backlog

The **Opportunity Backlog** is an ordered list of potential AI opportunities. It is refined through discovery events and maintained by the AI Lead to ensure relevance and clarity. It provides visibility, supports prioritisation, and informs where to apply AI.

### Context Repository

The **Context Repository** is a structured collection of validated contexts used by AI systems. It ensures consistency, relevance, and availability. The Context Owner(s) maintain the repository to prevent duplication, reduce noise, and preserve clarity. Following lean principles, the repository grows organically in response to demand rather than speculative accumulation. Context is pulled into the repository as needed, ensuring flow efficiency and maintaining focus on what delivers value now.

### Roadmap

The **Roadmap** is a high‑level view of prioritised AI initiatives derived from the Opportunity Backlog. It communicates intent, sequence, and focus areas without prescribing detailed implementation. The AI Lead owns the Roadmap, ensuring it reflects priorities and remains evidence‑based and adaptive.

## Summary

The Kendall Framework is a system of work for AI adoption. It is principled, concise, and evidence‑based. By applying it, organisations:

- Align on purpose, context, and objectives
- Establish clear accountability through Context Curators, Problem Owners, and Context Owners
- Prioritise opportunities through the Opportunity Backlog
- Maintain context integrity with structured accountability for context management
- Pull context at the rate of demand, ensuring lean flow and preventing waste
- Create and adapt a Roadmap led by the AI Lead
- Inspect and adapt through Opportunity & Context Sourcing Events
- Rely on the Kendall Coach to uphold principles, expose constraints, and enable organisational learning

The result is AI adoption that is purposeful, trustworthy, adaptive, flow‑oriented, and aligned with mission and value creation.
