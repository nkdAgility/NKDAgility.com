It addresses how multiple Scrum teams can collaborate effectively, manage dependencies, and enhance product delivery, aligning with the principles of organisational agility. However, the focus is more on the framework and team-level practices rather than broader organisational implications, which slightly limits its classification as primarily about enterprise agility.",
