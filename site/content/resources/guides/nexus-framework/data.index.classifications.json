The discussion is detailed, especially on how backlog management differs at scale, supported by practical examples on roles/accountabilities, events (e.g. Cross-Team Refinement), and artifact commitments (Product Goal). However, as the guide covers the entire Nexus framework—including roles, events, and artifacts—the content's main purpose is broader than solely Product Backlog management, resulting in a slightly lower depth and signal score. No sections actively contradict or critique the Product Backlog, and all information is current as of January 2021.
