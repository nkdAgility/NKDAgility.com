    "reasoning": "The content is the official Scrum Guide and comprehensively describes the Scrum framework, its values, events, artifacts, and roles. Nowhere in the content is Service Level Expectation (SLE) explicitly mentioned, nor is there any indirect discussion or explanation of SLE concepts (such as forecasting cycle time with probability, or using historical data to project a delivery window). While predictability and adaptation are described at a generic level, none of this is tied to SLE as defined in Kanban, Scrum with Kanban, or in any recognized SLE authoritative context. There are mentions of forecasting, cadence, and the roles of transparency and inspection, but these are in the context of team process and not as formulas or policies like SLE. No mention of how to calculate or apply SLE, no reference to elapsed time ranges with probabilities, and no reference to Daniel Vacanti, Reinertsen, or the Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams is present. The intent and audience align with Scrum practitioners, but the main topic is unrelated to SLE. Therefore, the Direct Mentions, Alignment, and Depth scores are all zero, with small nonzero scores for Intent (being informative in a related domain), Audience (Scrum teams, relevant), and Signal (high focus, even though irrelevant to SLE). No penalties are needed, and the final confidence is correctly calculated as zero.",

Detailed discussion of theory, values, and systemic evidence supports high depth/alignment scores. The guide targets practitioners, leaders, and coaches—matching the audience.

Artifacts like Product Goal and Increment are described as means of delivering value, and stakeholders are mentioned, but references to 'customer' are occasional and largely implicit.

The Guide frequently references non-negotiable rules and foundational concepts, but also mixes derived practices, values, and context-specific advice (e.g., team sizes, event cadences, or values like courage and respect). The depth of explanation for concepts like empiricism and adherence to framework rules somewhat aligns to first principles, but statements rarely mark them as irreducible or immutable truths in the explicit manner required. The guide's primary audience and intent are a reasonable match, and much of the document is focused and relevant. No penalties were warranted as the content is current and not undermining first principles. However, the lack of explicit framing, distinction between first and derived principles, and overall focus gives only partial alignment, resulting in a moderate score.",
