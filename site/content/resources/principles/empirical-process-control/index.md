[Empirical Process Control]({{< ref "/tags/empirical-process-control" >}}): [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) is an empirical process that relies on [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}), inspection, and adaptation. It means that the [Scrum team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) and stakeholders should be transparent about the work, inspect the progress regularly, and adapt the plan as necessary to achieve the desired outcomes.
