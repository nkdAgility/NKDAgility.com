title: 'Scrum Masters: Why Influence Alone May Not Be Enough'
short_title: Scrum Masters Need Authority, Not Just Influence
description: Explores why Scrum Masters need authority, not just influence, to enforce Agile practices, remove blockers, and ensure teams follow Scrum for true organisational agility.
tldr: Relying only on influence limits a Scrum Master's ability to drive real change, especially when teams or leaders resist Agile practices. Sustainable agility needs Scrum Masters who can enforce the framework, remove obstacles, and hold teams accountable, not just suggest improvements. Development managers should ensure Scrum Masters have enough authority to lead effectively, not just influence.

The idea that Scrum Masters should lead only through influence sounds noble—but in many organisations, it’s also naive.

Influence works when teams and leadership are already aligned. But what happens when they’re not? When teams reject Agile principles, leadership prioritises control over agility, or dysfunction is deeply embedded?

At some point, persuasion isn’t enough. A Scrum Master must be able to remove blockers, challenge bad practices, and uphold Scrum—not just suggest improvements and hope for the best.

If your Scrum Master has no authority to enforce the framework, to say “No, we don’t work like that,” or to hold teams accountable, what’s the point?

Scrum isn’t about soft influence. It’s about creating real, sustainable agility. That requires leadership backed by action, not just good intentions.

Where does your organisation stand on this?
