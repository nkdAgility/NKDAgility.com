title: Why Slow Processes Impact Developer Productivity and Performance
short_title: Why Slow Processes Hurt Developer Productivity
description: Explores how inefficient processes, not individual shortcomings, hinder developer productivity and performance, highlighting the need for systemic improvements.
tldr: Developer performance issues are often caused by slow or broken processes, not individual shortcomings. Focusing on improving systems like training, reviews, and team handoffs leads to better results than blaming people. To boost productivity, address process bottlenecks rather than targeting individuals.

I once heard a leader say, “This developer is too slow.” No, the process was slow.

If someone on your team is struggling, it’s not a personal failing—it’s a system failure. Maybe they weren’t given the right training. Maybe work sits in review for weeks. Maybe the handoffs between teams are a mess.

Nigel Thurlow puts it perfectly:  
“You never measure a person, ever. You only ever measure a process. You improve the system, never the people within it.”

People don’t fail in a vacuum. The system sets them up for success or failure. If you’re spending time trying to fix the person, you’re missing the real problem.

Want better performance? Fix the process.

Have you ever seen someone get blamed for a system failure?
