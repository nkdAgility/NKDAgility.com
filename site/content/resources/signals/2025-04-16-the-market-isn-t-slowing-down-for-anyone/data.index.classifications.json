While it frames the problem at an organisational level and references large-scale change, it barely mentions explicit large-scale Agile concepts or frameworks, focusing instead on the urgency of adaptability over named practices. The discussion avoids direct exploration of scaling Agile methodologies or frameworks, and doesn't explicitly discuss enterprise transformation.

However, the intended audience appears to be leaders or strategists at the organisational level, and the topic, while lightly covered, is relevant to large scale agility challenges.",
