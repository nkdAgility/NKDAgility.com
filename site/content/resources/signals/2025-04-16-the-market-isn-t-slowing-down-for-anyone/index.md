The market isn’t slowing down for anyone. While some organisations are still stuck debating frameworks, others are seizing opportunities and adapting at speed. The difference? Responsiveness.

It’s not about being "agile" or rolling out SAFe or some other packaged framework. It’s about moving faster than your competitors, making smarter decisions in real-time, and creating a system of work that allows you to pivot when the unexpected happens.

Some organisations think they can blend old-school control with new-world agility. That’s a delusion. If you’re still operating like a waterfall shop with "agile teams" patched on top, you're not just slowing down—you're actively losing ground.

Survival isn’t mandatory. The question is: Are you keeping pace with reality, or are you betting your future on outdated playbooks?
