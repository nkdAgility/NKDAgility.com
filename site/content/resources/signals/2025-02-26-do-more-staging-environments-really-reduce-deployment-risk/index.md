The argument that more staging environments is rooted in a common fallacy: that staging environments reduce risk. They don’t. They create a false sense of security.

Windows, Microsoft Teams, Starbucks POS; these platforms risk losing millions per hour during downtime. Yet they rely on continuous delivery and testing in production. Why? Because they understand that real safety comes from fast, automated feedback loops and quality built in from the start, not from artificial gates.

The only reason production deployments feel risky is because organisations underinvest in quality. Test-first development, continuous integration, automated testing, and audience-based deployments are proven strategies for reducing risk while delivering faster. Staging environments merely delay the discovery of issues—they don’t prevent them.

If your business can't tolerate downtime, the solution isn't more pre-production gates. It's engineering excellence through modern delivery practices. The choice isn't between staging or risk; it's between outdated practices and professionalism.
