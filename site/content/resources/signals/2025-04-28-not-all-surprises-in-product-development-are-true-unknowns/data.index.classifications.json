The discussion does not address engineering practice design for maximising agency; it keeps the frame narrowly on process management and team foresight. The audience (software teams) is tangentially relevant, as they are a subset of Agentic Engineering's wider audience, but the depth and intent focus more on backlog mechanics than agentic philosophies.",
