short_title: Hiring the Wrong Scrum Master Cripples Teams
description: Hiring an unqualified Scrum Master limits team growth, reduces agility, and hinders value delivery. Effective Scrum Masters drive change, coaching, and business alignment.
tldr: Hiring the wrong Scrum Master, especially one who acts as a process admin rather than a true agile leader, can seriously harm a Scrum Team. Effective Scrum Masters coach teams toward self-management, challenge obstacles, and connect engineering with business goals. To enable real agility and high performance, hire Scrum Masters who drive change and value, not just manage meetings.

The fastest way to cripple a Scrum Team? Hire the wrong Scrum Master.

Too many companies mistake the Scrum Master for a process admin. Someone to book meetings, write Jira tickets, and make sure the team follows “the rules.”

That’s not a Scrum Master. That’s an event planner.

The real Scrum Master is a lean-agile practitioner—someone who understands product strategy, DevOps, modern engineering, and team dynamics. They’re a change agent, not a note-taker.

A strong Scrum Master:

- Coaches the team to be self-managing, so they don’t depend on them.
- Challenges the status quo and removes obstacles, instead of just escalating them.
- Understands what good looks like in both product and engineering.
- Connects the team with the business, ensuring alignment on value delivery.

A weak Scrum Master? They turn into a Scrum Secretary, maintaining the illusion of agility while the team stagnates.

If you want Scrum to actually work, hire someone who sees Scrum as an enabler of high-performance teams—not just a set of meetings.

Seen this mistake before?
