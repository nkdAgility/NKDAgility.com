title: A bloated backlog is not a sign of good product management
short_title: A Bloated Backlog Signals Poor Management
description: A cluttered backlog signals poor product management, causing confusion and lost focus. Keep backlogs lean to highlight priorities and drive valuable, actionable work.
tldr: A backlog packed with every idea signals indecision, not good product management. Overloaded backlogs make it hard to prioritize, confuse stakeholders, and slow teams down. Keep your backlog focused on the most valuable upcoming work and regularly remove items your team cannot realistically address.

A bloated backlog is not a sign of good product management. It’s a sign of indecision.

If your backlog reads like an archive of every idea that’s ever been considered, you’re setting your team up for failure. The backlog is not a dumping ground for every possibility—it’s a lean inventory of unrealised value.

A cluttered backlog creates noise. It obscures priorities, confuses stakeholders, and forces teams to wade through irrelevance. The best backlogs? They are sharp, clear, and reflect only the next most valuable work.

If your backlog has more items than your team could complete in a year, it’s time to clean house.

What’s stopping you?
