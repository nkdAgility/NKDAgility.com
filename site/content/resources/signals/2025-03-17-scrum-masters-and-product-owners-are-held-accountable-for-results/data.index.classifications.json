The focus is entirely organizational and role-based rather than on process or explicit workflow policy, leading to extremely low scores across all classification dimensions but especially for direct mentions, alignment, depth, and signal-to-noise ratio.

The intent supports agency in tech roles, fitting the category's intent. The audience (Scrum professionals, agilists) matches the likely audience for Agentic Engineering.
