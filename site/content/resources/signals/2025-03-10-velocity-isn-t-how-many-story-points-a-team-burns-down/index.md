title: Velocity isn’t how many story points a team burns down
short_title: Velocity Is More Than Story Points Burned
description: Velocity measures how quickly teams turn ideas into value, using build, test, deploy, and feedback times—not just story points—to track real delivery speed.
tldr: Velocity is about how quickly your team delivers value, not just story points completed. Focus on measuring time to build, self-test, deploy, and learn from user feedback, as these are actionable and within your control. Start tracking these metrics to improve your delivery speed and effectiveness.

Velocity isn’t how many story points a team burns down. It’s how quickly you can turn an idea into value. That’s why the Azure DevOps team measured it using four key metrics:

1. Time to Build: From code change to a successful build. Faster builds mean faster feedback.
2. Time to Self-Test: How long automated tests take to run. The shorter, the better.
3. Time to Deploy: How fast a validated build reaches production.
4. Time to Learn: How quickly user feedback informs the next decision.

These metrics aren’t theoretical—they represent real stages in the flow of work, entirely within engineering’s control. No outside approval needed, no excuses. If you’re not measuring them, you’re not serious about continuous delivery.
