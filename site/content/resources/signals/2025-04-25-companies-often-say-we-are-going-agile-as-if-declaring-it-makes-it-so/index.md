title: Companies often say "we-are going Agile!" as if declaring it makes it so
short_title: True Agility vs. Superficial Agile Adoption
description: Many companies mistake adopting Agile frameworks for true agility, but real success comes from customising ways of working to respond quickly to market changes.
tldr: Simply declaring an Agile transformation does not make a company truly agile; real agility is about quickly responding to market changes, not just adopting frameworks like SAFe or Scrum@Scale. Successful organisations tailor their ways of working to their unique needs rather than copying others. Development managers should focus on building agility that fits their own business instead of relying on off-the-shelf solutions.

I've lost count of the number of times I've heard companies say, "We're going Agile!"—as if declaring it makes it so.

The reality? Most of these transformations are superficial at best. Agile isn’t about installing SAFe, Scrum@Scale, or any other framework. Those are just tools. The real game is market responsiveness—seizing opportunities faster than your competitors and adapting to change before it catches you off guard.

Most large organisations became successful by building their own ways of working—tailored to their markets, customers, and business realities. Why, then, do so many think copying another company's playbook will work for them?

Agility isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about survival. The companies that understand this are already outpacing the ones still debating which framework to buy.

Are you custom-building agility into your organisation, or are you just running someone else’s playbook?
