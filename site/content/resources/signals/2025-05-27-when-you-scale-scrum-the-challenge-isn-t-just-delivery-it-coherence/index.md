title: When you scale Scrum, the challenge isn’t just delivery—it coherence
short_title: 'Scaling Scrum: Achieving UX Coherence'
description: Explains how scaling Scrum requires UX coherence through Communities of Practice, shared frameworks, and collaboration—not central control—to ensure consistency without bottlenecks.
tldr: When scaling Scrum, the main challenge is maintaining coherence across teams, not just delivering work. Without coordination, teams create inconsistent user experiences and duplicate efforts. To address this, form a cross-team Community of Practice to develop shared frameworks and include them in your Definition of Done, promoting collaboration and consistency without adding hierarchy.

When you scale Scrum, the challenge isn’t just delivery—it’s coherence. UX is a great example. Left unchecked, each team reinvents the wheel, creates inconsistent interactions, and loses alignment.

The answer isn’t a central UX team doing all the work. It’s a Community of Practice made up of practitioners from each Scrum Team, collaborating to evolve a shared interaction framework. That framework then becomes part of your Definition of Done.

This isn’t about control. It’s about shared ownership and reuse without bottlenecks.

UX coherence at scale is a system design problem. Don’t solve it with more hierarchy. Solve it with better collaboration.

How are your UX practices scaling with your teams?
