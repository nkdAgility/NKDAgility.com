    "reasoning": "The content discusses scaling Scrum through UX coherence, Communities of Practice, and collaborative frameworks to ensure interactions across different teams are consistent. Although there is an indirect relationship between UX coherence and customer satisfaction (e.g., consistent user experiences may enhance customer satisfaction), the text does not explicitly or deeply discuss strategies for measuring, understanding, or explicitly improving customer satisfaction. Direct mentions of customer terms (customer happiness, loyalty, needs, direct feedback, satisfaction) are notably absent. The content remains primarily within the domain of organizational coherence, process scalability, and internal practices alignment—not customer satisfaction frameworks or explicit customer-focused agile methods. Thus, the conceptual alignment and depth of discussion related to 'Customer Satisfaction' are limited, reflected by low scores in those areas. However, the audience alignment is relatively high since agile and Scrum practitioners addressed here would indeed be concerned with customer satisfaction indirectly.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content deals primarily with UX coherence and organizational collaboration when scaling Scrum. It lightly relates to improving user experience indirectly but does not explicitly address customer satisfaction methods or metrics.",
