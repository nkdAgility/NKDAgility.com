If every release feels like a high-risk operation, you don’t have a Definition of Done—you have a definition of “we hope this works.”

Releasing software shouldn’t require a war room, late-night deployments, or a last-minute QA scramble. A strong DoD means every increment is ready for production the moment it’s complete, with security, compliance, and quality baked in.

The best teams treat releases as routine. No surprises. No drama. Just continuous flow.

How often does your team deliver without stress?
