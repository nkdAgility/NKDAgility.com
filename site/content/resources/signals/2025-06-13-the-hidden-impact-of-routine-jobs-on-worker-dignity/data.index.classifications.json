    "reasoning": "The content critiques repetitive jobs and urges moving toward meaningful, problem-solving roles as automation (robots and AI) increases. However, there is no explicit or implicit reference to agentic software delivery or the integration of autonomous AI agents with human expertise in software delivery contexts. The discussion is broad, sociological, and philosophical about work, not software delivery practice. Audience isn't technical or domain focused, and key agentic topics (agency in delivery, feedback loops, human-in-the-loop AI, or delivery frameworks) are missing. Thus, alignment, depth, and other scores remain very low. No penalties were needed.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content critiques routine work and calls for more meaningful job design as automation rises, but it does not discuss agentic software delivery, autonomous agents, or integration of AI in delivery teams. Alignment with the category is very weak.",
