title: A changing Definition of Done undermines quality and predictability in teams
short_title: Changing Definition of Done Hurts Team Quality
description: Frequent changes to the Definition of Done reduce team quality and predictability. Consistent, enforced standards are key to reliable delivery and continuous improvement.
tldr: Frequently changing the Definition of Done makes it hard for teams to deliver predictable results and maintain quality. The Definition of Done should only evolve to raise standards, not lower them. To improve predictability and quality, keep your Definition of Done consistent and ensure it is followed.

Imagine trying to run a factory job where the definition of a “finished product” changes every week. Forecasting production? Impossible. Measuring quality? Good luck.

Yet many teams change their Definition of Done so frequently that it becomes meaningless. This isn’t agility—it’s dysfunction.

The DoD can evolve, but only in the direction of increasing quality. Otherwise, you’re not iterating—you’re shifting goalposts and hoping no one notices.

If your teams struggle with predictability, start by making your DoD consistent and enforced. Agility doesn’t mean abandoning standards. It means continuously improving them.

Does your team’s Definition of Done stay consistent over time?
