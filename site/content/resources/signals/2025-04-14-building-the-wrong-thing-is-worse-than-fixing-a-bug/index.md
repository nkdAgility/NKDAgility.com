description: Most features don’t deliver value. Short feedback loops and real user input help teams avoid wasted effort by ensuring they build what users actually need.
tldr: Most features built by software teams do not deliver value, with 65 percent considered waste. Shortening feedback loops through frequent reviews and real user input helps teams focus on what matters and avoid building the wrong things. Act now to get faster, actionable feedback and prevent wasted time and resources.

Do you know what’s worse than fixing a bug? Building the wrong thing in the first place.

The data is clear: Only 35% of features actually deliver value. That means 65% of what teams build is waste—work that never should have been done.

The solution? Shorter feedback loops.

Frequent reviews, real user feedback, and fast iteration cycles keep teams focused on what actually matters instead of churning out features no one needs. If you’re still waiting until “the end” of a sprint to check if something is right, you’re already too late.

Shorten your feedback loops, or prepare to waste time and money on work that never delivers value.

What’s stopping your team from getting fast, actionable feedback?
