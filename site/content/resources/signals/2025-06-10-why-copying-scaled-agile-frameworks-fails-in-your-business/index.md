Most scaled agile frameworks sell the illusion that someone else’s success can be photocopied into your business. It can’t.

Every organisation has its own culture, constraints, and complexity. That means your path to agility has to be yours—tailored, incremental, and evidence-based.

You don’t need a guru’s blueprint. You need a vision, a backlog of real organisational impediments, and a team willing to experiment their way forward.

Start with the Agility Guide to Evidence-based Change. Then assemble your own guiding coalition. Define your own backlog. Iterate your way to agility.

Scrum gave us a proven social technology for product delivery. It’s time we used it to fix how our organisations work too.

Stop copying. Start owning.
