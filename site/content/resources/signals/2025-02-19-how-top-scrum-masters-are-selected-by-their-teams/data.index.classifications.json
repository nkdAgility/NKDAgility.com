There are no direct or indirect references to the Definition of Workflow or related concepts such as policies, entry/exit criteria, WIP limits, or Kanban. Concepts at the heart of the Definition of Workflow, like making work visible or managing flow, are entirely absent. Audience alignment is marginally better since practitioners of Scrum could tangentially intersect with workflow discussions, but the focus is not on workflow definition at all.",

There's only a slight conceptual alignment in advocating team autonomy, but little on the deliberate engineering of agency or continuous value delivery.
