The best Scrum Masters don’t apply for the role—they are chosen by their peers.

They’ve earned trust, respect, and credibility through years of hands-on experience. They have seen the inner workings of Scrum Teams, understood the dynamics, and proven themselves as effective leaders.

These are the individuals who have facilitated complex conversations, resolved conflicts, and guided teams through turbulent times. If you want a Scrum Master who can drive real change, look at who your team already turns to for guidance.

Assigning the role to someone external without the team's buy-in is a recipe for friction, not agility. Trust matters and the team’s voice matters even more. An authentic Scrum Master emerges naturally, gaining authority through action, not assignment.
