Scrum Masters love to talk about effectiveness, but here’s a reality check—effectiveness starts with delivery.

A team that delivers something of low value can still inspect, adapt, and improve. A team that delivers nothing has nothing to improve.

The Scrum Master is accountable for effectiveness, and that starts with delivery.

No delivery means no feedback. No feedback means no improvement. No improvement means no value.

Delivery is the minimum bar.

Scrum Masters—are you ensuring teams deliver every sprint? If not, what’s stopping you?
