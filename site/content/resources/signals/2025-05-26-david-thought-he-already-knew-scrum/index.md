David thought he already knew Scrum. Four hours into the class, he realised he didn’t.

This happens all the time. Eight years of doing "Scrum," but it’s actually a Frankenstein of old habits—command and control disguised in agile language.

The Applying Professional Scrum class is a reset. It’s not just about the mechanics of Scrum, but the why behind each element. The bounded environment. The transparency. The events that force inspection and adaptation.

Without that clarity, Scrum becomes cargo cult theatre. We hold the events, tick the boxes, but nothing actually changes.

Experienced practitioners need resets too. Because familiarity breeds complacency. And complacency kills agility.

When was the last time you challenged your understanding of Scrum?
