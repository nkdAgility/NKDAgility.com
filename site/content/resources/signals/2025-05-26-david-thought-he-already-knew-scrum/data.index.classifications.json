    "reasoning": "The content mainly discusses the difference between going through the motions of Scrum ('cargo cult theatre') and really understanding its core principles. It encourages experienced practitioners to revisit Scrum fundamentals for genuine clarity and agility. There’s implicit advocacy for alignment with real Agile principles, signaling some strategic relevance. However, there’s no direct mention of organizational strategy, leadership, or large-scale strategic planning. The primary audience is practicing Scrum professionals, not enterprise strategists. Examples focus on individual and team practice improvements rather than the strategic integration of Agile at an organizational level. Thus, while conceptually related and somewhat aligned (avoiding superficial Agile practice), the content does not offer depth or sustained focus on Agile Strategy as defined.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content highlights the importance of understanding and genuinely applying Scrum principles, advocating for ongoing learning among practitioners. While its themes align partially with Agile Strategy, its primary focus is on individual and team practice rather than on strategic, organizational-level topics.",

However, the main focus is on individual and team-level practice, not organisational transformation. There are no explicit frameworks, strategies, or leadership themes. Audience alignment is moderate, as practitioners could be involved in change, but the content stops short of addressing broader organisational change processes. No penalties applied as content is current and respectful.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece focuses mainly on Scrum practice and individual/team mindset shifts, with limited reference to organisation-wide change. While touching on agility, its scope is not clearly organisational, so fit with 'Organisational Change' is partial rather than direct.",

It mentions 'practitioners' but never explicitly references Product Developers, their accountabilities, or unique responsibilities. The piece focuses on generic Scrum principles, such as transparency, events, and the dangers of cargo cult agile, which are broadly applicable to anyone engaged in Scrum. There's no discussion of Product Developer role definition, cross-functional skills, or the specific accountability themes required for the category. Thus, most dimensions score low, except for audience and signal, which are fair since the piece is aimed at Scrum practitioners who may include Product Developers.",
