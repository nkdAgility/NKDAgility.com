description: Unreleased features create hidden costs and risks. Regular software delivery reduces failure rates, rework, and missed opportunities, ensuring real value is delivered.
tldr: Unreleased features create hidden costs and risks, as work that is not delivered provides no real value. Evidence shows that frequent releases reduce failure rates and improve stability, while long cycles lead to more rework and missed opportunities. Focus on shipping regularly to ensure your team's efforts translate into actual value.

Every unreleased feature is a cost.

Many teams treat software development like a factory, assuming that as long as work is being done, value is being created. But without delivery, all that effort is meaningless.

The CHAOS Report proves that long-cycle projects are far more likely to fail, while DORA metrics show that frequent releases reduce risks and improve stability. If you are not shipping regularly, you are accumulating hidden costsâ€”unvalidated work, increased rework, and lost opportunities.

Are you delivering value or just doing work?
