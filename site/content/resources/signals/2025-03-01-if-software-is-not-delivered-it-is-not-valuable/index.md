If software is not delivered, it is not valuable.

Many organizations invest months or years building features that never reach users. The longer software remains undelivered, the more risk, cost, and lost opportunity accumulate.

The CHAOS Report shows that long-cycle projects fail far more often than those with frequent, iterative releases. DORA research highlights that high-performing teams release more often, recover from failures faster, and reduce overall costs.

If you are not delivering frequently, you are not learning fast enough. Are you building products or just building assumptions?
