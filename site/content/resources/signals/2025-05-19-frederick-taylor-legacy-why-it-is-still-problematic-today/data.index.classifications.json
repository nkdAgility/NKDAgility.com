While Taylorism is a foundational management model, the discussion is more about its negative legacy than a structured analysis or direct application of models in Agile, DevOps, or Lean contexts. There is only implicit mention of shifting to new models focused on mastery, autonomy, and outcomes, with AI as a contextual lens. There is a mild alignment with the 'Model' category through critique of a historical model, but core topics like the Cynefin Framework or Lean Startup principles are not discussed, and the treatment lacks in-depth exploration of models in contemporary Agile or DevOps practice.
