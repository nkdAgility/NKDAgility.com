It neither mentions nor discusses Definition of Workflow, Kanban, nor related policies or agreements. Its message is about minimizing risk by shifting deployments directly to production. Although it addresses process improvement at a high level, it fails to align with the core Definition of Workflow concepts (explicit agreements, entry/exit policies, WIP limits, or making workflow visible/legible). The intent is to critique traditional process models rather than explain or improve explicit workflows, and the target audience is practitioners concerned with deployment safety—not teams managing work through Kanban/agile workflow. The critical tone and outdated references further decrease alignment and confidence.",
