short_title: Branch Promotion vs Modern Software Delivery
description: Explains why modern software teams avoid branch promotion, using continuous integration, feature flags, and production-like testing to streamline delivery and reduce risk.
tldr: Branch promotion slows down delivery and adds risk, while modern teams merge changes into the main branch as soon as they are ready and use feature flags to separate deployment from release. Testing in production-like environments and instant rollbacks improve speed and safety. Focus on managing the flow of work, not branches, to streamline delivery.

Branch promotion is a relic of slow, manual software delivery.

Modern teams integrate continuously:

- Every change merges into main as soon as it’s ready.
- Deployments are decoupled from releases using feature flags.
- Testing happens in production-like environments without blocking releases.

This approach makes rollbacks instant—no need for painful cherry-picking. And it eliminates reverse integration, a practice that introduces more risk than it removes.

The best teams don’t manage branches. They manage flow.
