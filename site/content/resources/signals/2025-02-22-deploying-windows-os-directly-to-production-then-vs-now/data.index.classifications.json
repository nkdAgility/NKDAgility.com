However, it does not mention Test First Development or its principles. The focus is on deployment strategies and post-deployment feedback, not on defining success criteria before implementation or on test-first philosophies such as TDD or ATDD. While it values fast feedback and quality, the approach is reactive (catching issues during staged rollout) rather than proactive (writing tests/criteria before building). Thus, the conceptual alignment and depth relative to Test First Development are weak. The audience is partly aligned as it targets engineering and product teams, but the content is too general and lacks specifics about test-first approaches.",
