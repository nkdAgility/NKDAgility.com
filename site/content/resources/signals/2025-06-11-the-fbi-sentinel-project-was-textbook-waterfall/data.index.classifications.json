While 'Organisational Agility' isn't explicitly named, it is strongly implied through the discussion of practices (Agile, Scrum), leadership decisions (forming a Scrum Studio, team hand-picking and empowerment), and organisational results (time and cost savings, delivery of working product). The focus is not on mere speed but on changes in structure, iterative delivery, and the underlying failure of inflexible methods, all clearly in line with the category. The audience (project leaders, executives, change agents) is also well aligned. However, it lacks finer-grained details about metrics, continuous improvement patterns, or extended exploration of overarching agile culture, slightly limiting its depth and signal.
