Great Scrum Masters and Product Owners don’t micromanage. They provide clarity, foster initiative, and hold teams accountable.

The best teams understand the vision, have the autonomy to execute, and own their results. But autonomy doesn’t mean working in a vacuum. It exists within a structured system—Scrum events, commitments, and organisational needs define the playing field.

Leadership isn’t about control for control’s sake. It’s about removing obstacles, enabling success, and stepping in when necessary.

True agility comes from balancing autonomy with alignment. If you let teams drift without structure, chaos follows. If you enforce rigid rules, you kill adaptability.

How do you strike that balance in your organisation?
