short_title: No One Questions Product Owner Authority
description: Explores why Product Owners’ authority is accepted while Scrum Masters’ is questioned, highlighting the need for clear authority to ensure team effectiveness and agile success.
tldr: Product Owners are trusted with authority to make decisions that drive product success, but Scrum Masters often lack similar authority despite being responsible for team effectiveness and removing obstacles. Relying only on persuasion limits their impact; Scrum Masters need the power to enforce good practices and address issues directly. Development managers should ensure Scrum Masters have the authority needed to fulfill their role and support team agility.

No one questions a Product Owner’s authority. They decide priorities, manage stakeholders, and ensure the team works on the most valuable outcomes. Their ability to make tough calls is what drives product success.

But when we talk about the Scrum Master’s authority, the conversation changes. Why?

Scrum Masters are accountable for team effectiveness. That means upholding Scrum, causing the removal of impediments, and challenging dysfunction, or just taking action. Yet too often, they are expected to do this purely through persuasion.

Influence matters, but it’s not always enough. Sometimes, a Scrum Master needs to say "No, this isn't how we work" or "This is blocking our ability to deliver value"—and have the authority to act on it.

If we accept that a Product Owner must have authority to fulfil their accountability, why do we question it for Scrum Masters?

Let’s stop treating Scrum Masters as passive facilitators. Their role is just as critical in ensuring agility.

Does your organisation recognise this?
