Every delay in decision-making is a tax on your organisation’s future.

While leaders sit in endless meetings, while approvals stack up, while risk-averse policies slow execution, your competitors are shipping, learning, and adapting.

Markets today don’t reward caution. They punish hesitation. The longer it takes to act, the more opportunities slip through your fingers. And the worst part? Most of the delay is self-inflicted.

Bureaucracy kills responsiveness. Layered hierarchies stifle innovation. If your company still needs five signatures to greenlight an experiment, you’re already behind.

Speed isn’t reckless. It’s survival. How much time is your organisation wasting?
