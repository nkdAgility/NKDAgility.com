short_title: Scrum Exposes Team Dysfunctions
description: Explains how Scrum reveals team dysfunctions by clarifying roles and accountability, highlighting its purpose to expose issues that hinder value delivery and improvement.
tldr: Scrum is meant to reveal problems in how teams work, not just provide a set process. If the Scrum Master, Product Owner, or Developers avoid their core responsibilities, the team will struggle to deliver value. Development managers should ensure their teams use Scrum to identify and address issues, not just go through the motions.

Scrum isn’t a process, it’s a social technology designed to expose dysfunction.

- The Scrum Master ensures Scrum is applied effectively.
- The Product Owner maximises value.
- The Developers deliver a Done Increment every Sprint.

If any of these accountabilities break down, Scrum falls apart.

A Scrum Master who doesn’t challenge poor practices isn’t "servant-leading", they’re letting teams fail slowly.

A Product Owner who treats the backlog like a list of requirements isn’t "managing scope", they’re avoiding accountability for value.

Developers that hide behind technical debt aren’t "moving fast", they are digging a hole they’ll have to climb out of later.

Scrum is not about best practices. It’s about exposing the uncomfortable realities that stop teams from delivering value.

Are we using Scrum to inspect and adapt, or are we just following the motions?
