title: Evolving Engineering Practices to Improve Sprint Workflow in Scrum
short_title: Evolving Engineering Practices in Scrum
description: Learn how evolving engineering practices like Feature Flags, TDD, and refactoring enable smoother Sprint workflows and reduce technical debt in Scrum teams.
tldr: To improve sprint workflow in Scrum without sacrificing quality, teams need to adopt practices like Feature Flags, TDD, and regular refactoring to enable safe, continuous flow of work. These practices help ship incomplete features safely, ensure code reliability, and maintain system health. Development managers should prioritize evolving engineering practices and consider Continuous Delivery essential for sustainable progress.

Want to flow work across Sprints without compromising Scrum? Then your engineering practices must evolve. The difference between “Unfinished Backlog Items” and “Undone Work” is critical.

If you’re shipping into production, you can’t afford brittle hacks or partial implementations. This is where Feature Flags, TDD, and refactoring come in. They’re not optional. They’re enablers of flow.

- Feature Flags let you ship incomplete features safely.
- TDD proves your code does what you expect, even after refactoring.
- Refactoring keeps your system healthy and maintainable.

Scrum doesn’t require Continuous Delivery, but let’s be honest, if you want flow, CD isn’t optional. It’s the price of admission.

How confident are you that your unfinished work isn’t just technical debt in disguise?
