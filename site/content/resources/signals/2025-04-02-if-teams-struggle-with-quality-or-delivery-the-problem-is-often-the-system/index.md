title: If teams struggle with quality or delivery, the problem is often the system
short_title: System Issues Cause Team Quality Problems
description: Team issues with quality or delivery often stem from weak systems, lacking clear standards, automation, and leadership support—not just team performance.
tldr: When teams face issues with quality or delivery, the root cause is often the broader system, not just the team itself. Consistent quality requires clear engineering standards, automation, and strong leadership support, not just team-level efforts. Leaders should ensure these foundations are in place rather than simply demanding results.

If teams are struggling with quality, technical debt, or inconsistent delivery, the issue isn’t just the team—it’s the system they’re operating in.

A strong Definition of Done isn’t something teams “figure out.” It requires engineering standards, automation, and organisational commitment. If leadership isn’t providing that foundation, don’t be surprised when teams cut corners under pressure.

Quality isn’t a grassroots effort—it’s a strategic priority.

Does your leadership support teams with a strong DoD, or just demand results?
