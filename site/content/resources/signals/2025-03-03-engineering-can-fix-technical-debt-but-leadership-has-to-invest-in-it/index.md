title: Engineering can fix technical debt, but leadership has to invest in it
short_title: Leadership Investment in Technical Debt
description: Technical debt requires leadership investment to resolve; without support for automation and quality improvements, continuous delivery is not achievable for engineering teams.
tldr: Fixing technical debt requires leadership investment, not just harder work from engineers. Success comes from funding automation, better testing, and empowering teams to address issues directly. If continuous delivery is not happening, leaders should reconsider their priorities and support the necessary improvements.

Engineering can fix technical debt, but leadership has to invest in it. Without that investment, continuous delivery remains a pipe dream.

Companies don't succeed by asking teams to “work harder.” They funded the work to automate pipelines, improve test coverage, and shift left on quality. They empowered engineers to fix bottlenecks without waiting for external approval.

Continuous delivery isn’t just an engineering challenge—it’s a leadership decision. If your teams can’t deliver continuously, ask yourself: what’s leadership prioritising instead?
