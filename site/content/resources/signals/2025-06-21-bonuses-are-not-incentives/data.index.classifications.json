The phrase 'If your company still relies on carrots and sticks, itâ€™s not agile' explicitly invokes Agile philosophy. While the Agile Manifesto isn't mentioned by name, concepts map strongly to the principles of motivated individuals, trust, and outcome orientation. The commentary targets practitioners and leaders seeking modern work approaches, in line with Agile's audience. There is limited explicit reference (the word 'agile' appears once), but the entire argument is built on Agile-aligned concepts. The depth is strong, with analysis of systemic issues and comparison to Taylorism. All dimensions are highly scored, with minor deductions for mentions due to lack of technical references or direct naming.",
