title: Scrum Teams don’t set the bar for quality—they meet it
short_title: Scrum Teams and the Definition of Done
description: Scrum Teams must consistently meet a clear, non-negotiable Definition of Done to ensure quality, manage risk, and prevent technical debt in every Sprint.
tldr: Scrum teams are responsible for meeting, not setting, the quality standard defined by the Definition of Done, which should be a strict, non-negotiable measure of what is releasable. Weakening or fluctuating the DoD increases risk and technical debt, undermining quality and predictability. Development managers should ensure their teams consistently strengthen the DoD over time rather than lowering it to deliver more features.

Scrum Teams don’t set the bar for quality—they meet it. The Definition of Done (DoD) isn’t a wishlist or a stretch goal. It’s a hard line that determines what is releasable. And if your DoD isn’t improving Sprint over Sprint, you’re accumulating risk and technical debt.

Too many teams treat DoD as negotiable. It’s not. It’s governance. It ensures predictability, manages risk, and protects revenue. A weak or fluctuating DoD means your organisation has no real control over quality.

If someone suggests lowering the DoD to "deliver more features," ask them to get it in writing from the financial director—because that’s not a technical decision, it’s a financial and risk decision.

Your Definition of Done should never shrink, only grow. Anything less is dysfunction.

How often is your team strengthening its DoD?
