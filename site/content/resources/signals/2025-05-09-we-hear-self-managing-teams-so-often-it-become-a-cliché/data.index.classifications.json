While it underscores the need for active, adaptive, disciplined work, it does not explicitly discuss core engineering practices such as code quality, CI/CD, or technical metrics. Its alignment with Engineering Excellence is partial: it appeals to disciplined practice and team function, which indirectly foster excellence but stops short of explicit technical depth.
