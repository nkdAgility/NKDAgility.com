We hear “self-managing teams” so often it’s become a cliché.

But here’s what gets missed:

Self-management applies to all Scrum roles.

Product Owners must self-manage how they engage with stakeholders, order the backlog, and shape the product vision.  
Scrum Masters must self-manage how they serve the team, coach the organisation, and create the conditions for success.  
Developers must self-manage how they plan, execute, and deliver the Increment.

This isn’t a passive concept.  
It’s active, adaptive, disciplined work.

Scrum isn’t designed to be a loose, anything-goes framework.  
It’s a social technology to deliver adaptive solutions — and that requires disciplined self-management across roles, grounded in clear alignment.

Where are you mistaking “self-management” for chaos or neglect?
