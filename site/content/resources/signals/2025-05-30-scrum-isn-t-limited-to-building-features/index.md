Scrum isn’t limited to building features. It’s a social technology for solving complex problems. That includes your internal systems of work.

We use Scrum to deliver product increments. Why not use it to deliver organisational change increments?

Form a change team. Create a change backlog. Make each improvement inspectable, transparent, and releasable. Measure the effect. Adapt the plan. Rinse and repeat.

This isn’t transformation theatre. This is evidence-based change, one step at a time.

If your change program doesn’t have a cadence, a backlog, and empirical feedback—it’s not agile. It’s just theatre in agile clothing.

Want real agility? Apply Scrum to the system, not just the software.
