However, it is primarily focused on the proper functioning of Scrum teams rather than explicit market responsiveness or adaptability strategies. There are indirect links to adaptability—such as enabling teams to thrive and respond to challenges—but no direct emphasis on market-facing agility, feedback loops, or Lean/DevOps. Mentions of 'alignment' and 'accountability' point toward adaptability but lack explicit market context. The depth is moderate as the piece goes beyond clichés, but it remains internally focused (team effectiveness) rather than on adapting to external market change.",
