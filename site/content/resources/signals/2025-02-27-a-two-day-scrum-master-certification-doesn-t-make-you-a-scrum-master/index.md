A two-day Scrum Master certification doesn’t make you a Scrum Master.

Real Scrum Masters are forged in the fire of delivering value with high-performing Scrum Teams. They’ve experienced the chaos, the challenges, and the victories. They’ve lived the agile ethos, battled organisational impediments, and facilitated continuous improvement.

Their knowledge extends beyond theory; they understand code quality, modern DevOps practices, and the intricacies of product delivery. If your entire experience is a certification, you’re not ready. And companies? Don’t expect your multi-million-dollar product to be shepherded by someone whose qualification fits on a PDF.

Experience matters. Invest in it. Agile is not a buzzword; it’s a commitment to excellence, and your Scrum Master must embody that commitment through hard-earned experience.
