The audience (aspiring Scrum Masters, hiring managers) is aligned, and the message encourages investment in professional growth, but the content stops short of providing specific mentoring guidance, methods, or strategies.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the piece stresses experience and ongoing growth for Scrum Masters, it doesn’t directly address mentoring or coaching practices, leaving considerable distance from the category’s core purpose.

It briefly nods to code quality and DevOps but primarily critiques superficial certification. Core engineering excellence themes—software craftsmanship, best practices, CI/CD—are touched but not explored in depth. The main emphasis is on the role and legitimacy of Scrum Masters, not on rigorous engineering practices, so alignment and depth scores are moderate. The target audience (engineering managers, team leads) matches well, and the content is focused and on-topic, but direct, sustained discussion of Engineering Excellence is limited.",
