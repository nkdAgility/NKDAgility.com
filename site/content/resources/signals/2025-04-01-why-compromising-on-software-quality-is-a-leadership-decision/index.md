title: Why compromising on software quality is a leadership decision
short_title: Software Quality Is a Leadership Decision
description: Compromising software quality is a leadership choice, not a team one. Lowering standards carries business risks that should be openly addressed by decision-makers.
tldr: Compromising on software quality is a leadership decision, not a team one, and lowering standards to meet deadlines carries business risks that should be explicitly approved by leadership. A clear Definition of Done helps maintain consistent quality, and any decision to reduce it should be transparent and deliberate. Development managers should ensure quality expectations are set and upheld at the leadership level, not left to teams under delivery pressure.

Would your CFO sign off on a financial report that was “mostly accurate”? Would your legal team approve a contract that “should be enforceable”? No?

Then why do organisations think it’s acceptable to compromise on software quality?

A strong Definition of Done prevents cutting corners. It ensures every increment meets the same professional standard. Reducing quality to meet deadlines is a financial decision, not a team decision. If leadership wants to change the quality bar, they should sign off on the risks—not sneak it past teams under the banner of “Agile.”

Scrum teams don’t get to lower quality. And if your teams are being asked to, the real conversation should be happening in the boardroom.

Has your leadership ever knowingly shipped bad software?
