While transparency and workflow visualization are mentioned—topics conceptually adjacent to SLE—it does not mention Service Level Expectation, its definition, calculation, or intended use in Agile/Kanban contexts. There are no references to historical cycle time, probabilistic forecasting, or SLE’s role in predictability. The main focus is organizational response to transparency rather than setting, tracking, or improving SLE. Therefore, there is minimal direct mention, loose conceptual proximity, and only tangential relevance.",
