A great Scrum Master isn’t measured by how well they facilitate meetings. It’s not about whether the Daily Scrum starts on time or if they keep the Sprint Retrospective engaging.

A successful Scrum Master leaves behind a self-sustaining team—one that delivers valuable, high-quality products with predictability.

Their impact shows up in:
- Empirical product planning—helping teams and stakeholders navigate uncertainty with real data.
- Product Backlog management—supporting the Product Owner in defining goals that actually drive value.
- Removing organisational barriers—not just within the team, but across the business.
- Enabling cross-functional collaboration—making silos obsolete.
- Helping the team deliver Done increments—not just finishing tasks, but delivering outcomes.

If a Scrum Master disappears and the team falls apart, they weren’t coaching. They were hand-holding.

Want to know if your Scrum Master is effective? Ask yourself: Is the team better because of them?

If the answer isn’t a clear yes, something needs to change.

What does a high-impact Scrum Master look like in your experience?
