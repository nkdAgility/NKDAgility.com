title: You can’t deliver change through memos
short_title: Change Requires Broad Scrum Training
description: Change succeeds when everyone understands and engages with it. Broad Scrum training empowers all roles to identify blockers and drive real, lasting improvements.
tldr: Change cannot be achieved through memos or top-down mandates; real progress happens when everyone is trained together and understands the reasons behind new approaches. Broad-based training helps people identify problems and suggest improvements, making change more effective and sustainable. To drive meaningful change, involve all stakeholders in learning and improvement, not just managers or specialists.

You can’t deliver change through memos. Or tool rollouts. Or executive mandates. If people don’t understand the change, they’ll resist it. Silently. Subtly. And completely.

Train everyone. Yes, everyone.

When I run broad-based Scrum training—everyone from warehouse workers to execs in the same room—magic happens. People start to see the system. They name the blockers. They suggest real improvements.

You don’t need change managers whispering from the sidelines. You need forklift drivers pointing out waste in your value stream. You need product owners seeing dependencies they can cut. You need teams who actually understand why Scrum works.

The best source of organisational change backlog items? Your stakeholders. Right after training.

Scrum isn’t a framework you install. It’s a language you teach so the organisation can learn together.
