If you're waiting for a framework to shift your culture, you're already on the wrong path.

The biggest obstacle to change isn’t lack of knowledge—it’s inertia. The culture and process you already have are your biggest constraints.

That’s why real change starts with a vision. Not just a buzzwordy slide deck. A vision that sets direction without prescribing how. One that empowers the people doing the work to identify what’s in the way of value delivery.

Then you need public, top-down commitment. If leadership isn’t visibly in, the change dies quietly.

And no, posters and roadshows won’t cut it. Get everyone into a room. Teach them theory. Help them see the system they’re in. Then have them tell you what needs to change.

Change isn’t a comms strategy. It’s a coalition of action.
