description: Delaying software releases increases failure risk. Frequent, small releases improve success rates, adaptability, and recovery, as shown by CHAOS Report and DORA metrics.
tldr: Delaying software releases increases the risk of failure and falling behind competitors. Frequent, smaller releases lead to higher success rates and faster recovery, as shown by industry research. Focus on delivering quickly and iterating rather than waiting for a perfect release.

Every delay increases the risk of failure.

Organizations that take too long to release software fall behind. While they refine, plan, and internally validate, their competitors deliver, learn, and adapt.

The Standish Groupâ€™s CHAOS Report found that only 29% of long-cycle projects succeed, while agile, frequent-release projects succeed up to 64% of the time. DORA metrics confirm that teams that release more often have lower failure rates and faster recovery times.

Deliver small, deliver fast, and adjust. If you are waiting for the perfect release, you are already losing.
