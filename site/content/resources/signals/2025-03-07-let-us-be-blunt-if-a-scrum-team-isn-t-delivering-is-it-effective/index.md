Let’s be blunt—if a Scrum Team isn’t delivering, is it effective?

Scrum exists to deliver usable increments. Without that, everything else—standups, retros, sprints—is just theatre.

So if a team isn’t delivering, what happens? Who gets held accountable?

The Scrum Master.

Not because they write the code, but because their job is to enable the system that produces working product every sprint.

If a team is stuck, their job is to unstick it.  
If delivery is failing, they must ensure the system is fixed to enable delivery.

No delivery? No effectiveness.

Disagree? Let’s talk.
