    "reasoning": "The content centers on Scrum Team effectiveness and the Scrum Master's accountability for delivery. There is no explicit reference to Lean principles, waste reduction, or continuous improvement. Conceptually, effective delivery aligns weakly with Lean's focus on value, but Lean terminology, tools, and philosophy are absent. The depth remains surface-level, mainly critiquing Scrum teams and roles. The intent is tangential to Lean, as it's about Scrum, and while the target audience somewhat overlaps, it isn’t tailored for Lean practitioners. The content is reasonably focused, but largely off-topic for 'Lean Principles.'",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses Scrum accountability and delivery, not Lean Principles. While there’s slight conceptual overlap in emphasizing value delivery, it doesn't reference Lean concepts, tools, or philosophy—making it a weak fit for the category.",

There is no explicit or implied discussion of estimation, empirical forecasting, or related Agile estimation techniques. The content is aimed at Scrum practitioners, but it stays on team accountability and delivery rather than estimation topics. No penalties apply, as there is no obsolete or contradictory framing.",

While 'standups' (common slang for Daily Scrum) are mentioned, it is only in passing and not in depth or with explicit focus on the Daily Scrum's structure or practices. The narrative is centered on outcomes and accountability rather than the mechanics, intent, or best practices of the Daily Scrum event. Little material addresses the intended audience for Daily Scrum-specific discussions, and most of the content is broader or tangential.",
