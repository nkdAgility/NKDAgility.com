The best outcome of a Applying Professional Scrum class isn’t just better understanding of Scrum. It’s a backlog of change.

At Healthgrades, 147 people left not just with insight, but with agency. They had identified the organisational impediments standing in their way—and started a backlog of what needed to shift.

That’s the real value: clarity about what’s slowing delivery and the collective power to fix it.

Scrum done well doesn’t just improve teams. It exposes the system. And when leadership listens, real transformation starts.

But it only happens when teams are empowered to name the problems, and leadership is accountable for removing them.

What’s on your organisational change backlog?
