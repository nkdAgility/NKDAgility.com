Hiring a Product Owner? Don’t just copy-paste a job spec from the internet. A real PO isn’t just a requirements collector or project manager—they own product success.

Here’s what a strong Product Owner actually does:

- Defines the vision and ensures the team is working on the highest-value items.
- Collaborates daily with Developers and stakeholders to refine direction.
- Uses data to make decisions instead of relying on gut instinct or seniority.
- Says no when necessary, even when it’s unpopular.
- Orders the backlog strategically, not reactively.

And here’s the hard truth: one person alone cannot do all of this at scale. POs delegate, but they remain accountable. If a PO is just taking orders, someone else is actually running the product—and that’s a problem.

If your PO is buried in admin work instead of driving outcomes, you don’t have a real PO. You have a backlog secretary.

What’s the biggest gap in most Product Owner job descriptions you’ve seen?
