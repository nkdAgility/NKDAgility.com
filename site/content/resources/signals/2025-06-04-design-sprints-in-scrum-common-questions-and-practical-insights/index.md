I’m still surprised how often I get asked about “Design Sprints” in Scrum. Let’s be clear—there are no special Sprints. No Sprint 0. No release Sprint. No hardening Sprint. And definitely no Design Sprint.

Scrum is a social technology for solving complex problems. Trying to segment Sprints by function (design, test, build) reflects a Taylorist approach rooted in the Industrial Revolution, not the realities of modern product development.

If your UX work is critical to delivering the Sprint Goal, then it belongs in the Sprint. If it’s about preparing for the future, then it’s part of Refinement. But none of it needs a dedicated, isolated timebox.

The goal is high-quality working software, not siloed ceremonies.

How are you integrating UX, design, and architecture into your Sprint without breaking the flow?
