One of the biggest fallacies in software is the belief that you can know everything upfront. That’s why some teams try to carve out “Design Sprints” to feel more in control.

But real product development doesn’t work like that. Discovery is continuous. Ideas evolve. Assumptions break. Value emerges through use.

That’s why Scrum embraces uncertainty. Refinement is your chance to explore future work just enough to be ready, without wasting time planning things that might never happen.

Build just enough design to support delivery. Then deliver. Get telemetry. Learn. Repeat.

If you're spending more time designing than delivering, you're likely optimising the wrong part of the system.
