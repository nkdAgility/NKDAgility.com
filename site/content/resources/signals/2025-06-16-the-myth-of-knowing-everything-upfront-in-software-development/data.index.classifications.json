While the piece targets an audience who cares about adaptive team practices (potentially overlapping with the Test First audience), its main focus is on empiricism, limited planning, and Scrum's refinement process. Only a tangential link to Test First Development exists through the emphasis on learning and feedback cycles, but the core principles of Test First Development—like writing tests before code or using success criteria for quality—are not addressed.
