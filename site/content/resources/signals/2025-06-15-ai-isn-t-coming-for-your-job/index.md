title: AI isn’t coming for your job
short_title: AI Isn’t Coming for Your Job
description: AI is automating repetitive tasks, freeing people to focus on creative, strategic, and empathetic work that technology can’t replace. It’s a shift, not a threat.
tldr: AI is not replacing people but automating repetitive tasks that never needed human input, such as data entry and routine reporting. This shift exposes the limitations of roles designed for control and repetition, highlighting the need for work that leverages human strengths like empathy and adaptability. Development managers should redesign roles to focus on meaningful, creative tasks that AI cannot perform.

AI isn’t coming for your job. It’s coming for the work that never deserved a human to begin with.

Filling in forms. Copying data between systems. Generating routine reports. That’s not what people are here for.

We built a system that said humans were the problem to be managed. So we created roles to match—narrow, controlled, repetitive.

Now that AI can do those things better and faster, the system is cracking.

That’s not the end of work. It’s the beginning of better work.

The kind that requires empathy, strategy, adaptability. The kind of work machines can’t do.

If AI feels like a threat in your organisation, it’s not because it’s replacing people. It’s because you’ve built roles that treat people like machines.

Time to fix that.

What kind of work are you creating space for?
