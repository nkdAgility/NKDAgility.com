AI isn’t coming for your job. It’s coming for the work that never deserved a human to begin with.

Filling in forms. Copying data between systems. Generating routine reports. That’s not what people are here for.

We built a system that said humans were the problem to be managed. So we created roles to match—narrow, controlled, repetitive.

Now that AI can do those things better and faster, the system is cracking.

That’s not the end of work. It’s the beginning of better work.

The kind that requires empathy, strategy, adaptability. The kind of work machines can’t do.

If AI feels like a threat in your organisation, it’s not because it’s replacing people. It’s because you’ve built roles that treat people like machines.

Time to fix that.

What kind of work are you creating space for?
