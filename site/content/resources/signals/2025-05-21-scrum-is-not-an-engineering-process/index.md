title: Scrum is not an engineering process
short_title: Scrum Is Not an Engineering Process
description: Explains why Scrum is a social framework, not just engineering, emphasizing inclusive training, alignment, collaboration, and breaking command-and-control mindsets for true agility.
tldr: Scrum is a framework for fostering collaboration across the whole organisation, not just an engineering process for developers. True agility happens when everyone, regardless of role, understands and participates in Scrum, which helps break down silos and exposes issues that slow delivery. To achieve real change, ensure your entire team is aligned and involved in the conversation about how value is delivered.

Scrum is not an engineering process. It's a social technology that invites everyone in the organisation into the conversation.

When I trained 147 people at Healthgrades, it wasn’t just Developers and Product Owners. It was the whole engineering department. Because if you want agility, you don’t cherry-pick who learns Scrum. You don’t gate understanding behind job titles. You bring everyone in.

That’s how you break the illusion of command and control. That’s how you expose the assumptions, habits, and dysfunctions that stall delivery.

It’s not enough to say “we do Scrum.” You have to ask: is everyone aligned around how value flows? If not, you’re just playing at agility.

Real change starts when everyone speaks the same language. Is your whole organisation part of the conversation?
