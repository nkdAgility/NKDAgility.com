Fear is the real enemy of agility.

Fear of raising an issue.  
Fear of stopping the line.  
Fear of being wrong.  
Fear of change.

Agile, Scrum, and DevOps are about enabling continuous delivery of value through learning, adaptation, and trust.

But if fear rules your workplace, all you’ll get is stagnation, no matter how many "Agile ceremonies" you run.

The real work of a Scrum Master, Product Owner, or leader isn’t in running events or building roadmaps.  
It’s in systematically removing fear from the system.

Courage is the first Scrum Value for a reason.

Are you building a system where courage thrives—or where fear festers?
