Inside every slow-moving organisation is an innovation graveyard—a place where great ideas die before they ever see daylight.

How?

- Leaders demand "certainty" before taking a step.
- Risk is managed by avoiding it, not navigating it.
- New ideas must be "aligned" before they can be tested.

Meanwhile, the companies actually winning today? They launch. They learn. They iterate. They don’t wait until an idea is bulletproof because they know perfection is a lie in fast-moving markets.

The worst waste in a business isn’t money. It’s unrealised potential. How many great ideas has your organisation buried?
