title: 'Innovation graveyards: Where great ideas die in slow organisations'
short_title: Innovation Graveyards in Slow Organisations
description: Explores how slow organisational processes, risk aversion, and excessive alignment cause promising ideas to stall, leading to lost innovation and unrealised potential.
tldr: Slow organisations kill promising ideas by demanding certainty, avoiding risk, and requiring full alignment before testing anything. Successful companies move quickly, experiment, and improve as they go, understanding that waiting for perfection leads to missed opportunities. To avoid wasting potential, encourage faster testing and learning from new ideas.

Inside every slow-moving organisation is an innovation graveyard—a place where great ideas die before they ever see daylight.

How?

- Leaders demand "certainty" before taking a step.
- Risk is managed by avoiding it, not navigating it.
- New ideas must be "aligned" before they can be tested.

Meanwhile, the companies actually winning today? They launch. They learn. They iterate. They don’t wait until an idea is bulletproof because they know perfection is a lie in fast-moving markets.

The worst waste in a business isn’t money. It’s unrealised potential. How many great ideas has your organisation buried?
