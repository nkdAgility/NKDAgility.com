title: The True Role of a Scrum Master Beyond Facilitation
short_title: The True Role of a Scrum Master
description: Explains how a Scrum Master drives team improvement, removes obstacles, and leads organisational change, going far beyond basic facilitation or meeting management.
tldr: A Scrum Master’s real value is in driving team improvement and organisational change, not just running meetings or handling admin tasks. They should coach teams, remove obstacles, and ensure Scrum is used to deliver value. Development managers should empower Scrum Masters to act as change agents rather than limiting them to facilitation.

If you think a Scrum Master is just a facilitator, you’re missing the point.

A Scrum Master is accountable for enabling outcomes, not just running meetings. That means teaching, coaching, and challenging teams to work better. It means removing systemic impediments, shaping organisational change, and ensuring Scrum is applied effectively.

If all a Scrum Master does is schedule events and take notes, they’re a glorified admin—not a change agent.

Scrum isn’t a process to enforce; it’s a social technology for delivering value. And Scrum Masters who treat it as a set of rituals instead of a means for improving how teams work are failing their teams.

What’s the most valuable thing a Scrum Master can do in a day? Hint: It’s not writing meeting minutes.
