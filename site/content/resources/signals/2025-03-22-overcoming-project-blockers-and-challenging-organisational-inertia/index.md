title: Overcoming Project Blockers and Challenging Organisational Inertia
short_title: Overcoming Project Blockers and Inertia
description: Explores how lack of authority hinders teams from removing project blockers and overcoming organisational inertia, stressing the need for real autonomy to achieve results.
tldr: Teams are often held responsible for project outcomes without having the authority to remove blockers or challenge ineffective practices, which leads to frustration and failure. True accountability requires giving teams both autonomy and the power to influence their environment. Development managers should ensure teams have the authority needed to address obstacles and drive results, not just the responsibility.

Imagine you’re responsible for delivering a critical project, but every time you try to remove a blocker, someone tells you it’s “not your call.” Every time you challenge a dysfunction, you’re met with, “We’ve always done it this way.”

Now imagine being held accountable for the failure.

This is what happens when teams are given responsibility without control. Scrum Masters and Product Owners are expected to drive results, but if they lack the authority to remove impediments, challenge dysfunction, and enforce alignment when necessary, their hands are tied.

Autonomy is crucial, but it must come with the ability to influence the system. Alignment doesn’t mean top-down control; it means ensuring the team has what it needs to succeed without unnecessary interference.

If you expect people to own outcomes, they must have the authority to shape the environment that impacts those outcomes. Anything less is just setting them up to fail.

How does your organisation balance autonomy and control?
