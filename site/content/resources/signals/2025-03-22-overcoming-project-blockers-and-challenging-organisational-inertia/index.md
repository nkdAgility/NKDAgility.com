Imagine you’re responsible for delivering a critical project, but every time you try to remove a blocker, someone tells you it’s “not your call.” Every time you challenge a dysfunction, you’re met with, “We’ve always done it this way.”

Now imagine being held accountable for the failure.

This is what happens when teams are given responsibility without control. Scrum Masters and Product Owners are expected to drive results, but if they lack the authority to remove impediments, challenge dysfunction, and enforce alignment when necessary, their hands are tied.

Autonomy is crucial, but it must come with the ability to influence the system. Alignment doesn’t mean top-down control; it means ensuring the team has what it needs to succeed without unnecessary interference.

If you expect people to own outcomes, they must have the authority to shape the environment that impacts those outcomes. Anything less is just setting them up to fail.

How does your organisation balance autonomy and control?
