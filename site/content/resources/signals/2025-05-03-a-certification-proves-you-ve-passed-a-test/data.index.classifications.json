    "reasoning": "The content broadly discusses certifications and real-world competence, emphasizing general product management and hiring. However, it directly mentions PSPO I and II, linking to Scrum-based frameworks, thus weakening a pure Miscellaneous alignment. The focus remains non-technical and personal, with anecdotal and opinion-based points rather than theoretical or practical Agile/Scrum guidance. While most examples are framework-agnostic, referencing explicit certifications (PSPO I and II) triggers a penalty. The discussion is relevant for practitioners and hiring managers in Agile contexts, but its core message strays from specified frameworks, focusing on meta-issues like certification value and experience. Signal-to-noise remains high, but the inclusion of recognized Scrum.org credentials means the category fit is not absolute.",
