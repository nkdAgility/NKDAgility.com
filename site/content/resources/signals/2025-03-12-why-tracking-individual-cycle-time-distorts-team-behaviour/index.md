title: Why Tracking Individual Cycle Time Distorts Team Behaviour
short_title: Tracking Individual Cycle Time Harms Teams
description: Tracking individual cycle time can harm team performance by encouraging task cherry-picking, reduced collaboration, and lower quality, without improving overall delivery speed.
tldr: Tracking individual cycle time leads people to focus on looking good rather than improving team performance, causing them to pick easy tasks, rush work, and avoid collaboration. This does not improve actual delivery time and results in local optimisations that do not help deliver value. Focus on measuring and improving team flow metrics like lead time, work in progress, and throughput instead.

When you track individual's cycle time, you aren’t just measuring the wrong thing, you’re actively distorting behaviour.

People will start working in ways that make them look good instead of making the system better. They’ll cherry-pick the easiest tasks. They’ll rush work at the expense of quality. They’ll avoid collaborating because waiting on someone else makes their numbers worse.

And guess what? The actual delivery time doesn’t improve. You just get more local optimisations that have nothing to do with getting value out the door.

Kanban isn’t about making individuals go faster. It’s about improving flow. You want to optimise lead time, work in progress (WIP), and throughput. That’s where speed comes from, not from pressuring individuals to move faster.

How are you measuring flow in your system?
