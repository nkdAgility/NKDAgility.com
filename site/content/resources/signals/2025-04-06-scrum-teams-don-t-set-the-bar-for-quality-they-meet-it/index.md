title: Scrum Teams don’t set the bar for quality—they meet it
short_title: Scrum Teams Meet Quality with Definition of Done
description: Scrum Teams uphold, not lower, quality by strictly following and evolving the Definition of Done, ensuring predictable releases and reducing technical debt and risk.
tldr: Scrum teams are responsible for meeting, not setting, the quality standard defined by the Definition of Done, which should be a strict and evolving benchmark for what is releasable. Treating the DoD as negotiable increases risk and technical debt, undermining control over quality and revenue. Development managers should ensure their teams regularly strengthen the DoD to maintain high standards and reduce long-term risk.

Scrum Teams don’t set the bar for quality—they meet it. The Definition of Done (DoD) isn’t a wishlist or a stretch goal. It’s a hard line that determines what is releasable. And if your DoD isn’t improving Sprint over Sprint, you’re accumulating risk and technical debt.

Too many teams treat DoD as negotiable. It’s not. It’s governance. It ensures predictability, manages risk, and protects revenue. A weak or fluctuating DoD means your organisation has no real control over quality.

If someone suggests lowering the DoD to "deliver more features," ask them to get it in writing from the financial director—because that’s not a technical decision, it’s a financial and risk decision.

Your Definition of Done should never be static, but always evolving to maximise the quality. Anything less is dysfunction.

How often is your team strengthening its DoD?
