short_title: You Don’t Own Your Market
description: Explains why businesses must prioritise customer needs and agility to stay relevant, avoid missed opportunities, and remain competitive in a rapidly changing market.
tldr: Your customers control the market, not you, so failing to listen or respond quickly means losing them to competitors. Many organizations prioritize internal views over real customer needs, leading to late product launches and missed opportunities. To stay relevant, focus on genuine customer feedback and ensure your teams are closely connected to those you serve.

You don’t own your market. Your customers do. Ignore them, move too slowly, and they’ll move on.

But most organisations don’t listen. They get stuck in their own echo chambers, convinced they know best. Meanwhile:

- Products launch too late to be relevant.
- Internal priorities outweigh real customer needs.
- Decision-makers are too far from the people they serve.

Every delay, every missed signal, every slow response is an open door for your competition.

Agility isn’t about speed for speed’s sake. It’s about staying relevant. Are you still in sync with your customers, or just assuming they’ll wait?
