short_title: 99% of Animal Species Are Now Extinct
description: Most animal species have gone extinct due to failure to adapt; similarly, businesses must evolve processes and mindsets to survive in changing markets.
tldr: Most animal species have gone extinct because they could not adapt, and the same fate can happen to companies that fail to evolve. Relying on past successes or outdated processes puts your business at risk, as the market changes quickly and does not wait. To stay competitive, focus on true adaptability and regularly assess what is slowing your company down.

99% of all animal species that have ever existed are extinct.

Companies are no different.

Every year, businesses collapse because they failed to adapt. Some had a great product but couldn’t evolve their processes. Others had a strong market position but clung to outdated ways of working.

The reality is harsh: Your past success won’t protect you from future failure.

If you’re relying on policies and structures that worked five years ago, you’re already behind. The market won’t wait for you to catch up.

Agility isn’t about labels, frameworks, or rituals. It’s about survival.

And survival is optional.

What’s the biggest obstacle stopping your company from moving faster?
