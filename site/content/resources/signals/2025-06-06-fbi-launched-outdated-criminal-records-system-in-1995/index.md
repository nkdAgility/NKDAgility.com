short_title: FBI’s Outdated 1995 Criminal Records System
description: The FBI’s 1995 criminal records system was outdated at launch, showing how slow, waterfall methods can leave technology obsolete and users behind. Agile avoids this trap.
tldr: The FBI launched a criminal records system in 1995 that was already outdated, and it remained in use for 15 years. Relying on big, infrequent releases means technology and user needs quickly outpace your delivery. To avoid delivering obsolete solutions, shift to frequent, incremental releases so you can keep up with changing requirements and user expectations.

In 1995, the FBI launched a criminal records system that was obsolete the day it shipped. It used green screens while Windows 95 was on the shelves.

That system lasted 15 years.

Waterfall creates a world where value arrives too late to matter. By the time the big launch finally comes, the world has moved on, your tech stack is ancient, and your users are stuck in the past.

Agile delivery doesn't just help you fail faster. It helps you deliver before failure is baked in.

Still waiting for that "big release"? Your users have already left.
