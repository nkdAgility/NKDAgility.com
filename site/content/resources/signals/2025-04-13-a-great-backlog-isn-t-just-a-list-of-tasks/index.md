A great backlog isn’t just a list of tasks. It’s a strategic tool for delivering value.

Too many teams treat the backlog as a never-ending to-do list, filling it with requests, features, and ideas without considering their impact. The result? A mountain of work that grows endlessly, losing focus and clarity.

A well-crafted backlog reflects:

- The product’s vision
- The team’s best guess at unrealised value
- The strategic trade-offs needed to maximise ROI

If your backlog doesn’t help you make better decisions, it’s just noise. The question isn’t how much you have in your backlog—it’s how much of it actually matters.

What does your backlog say about your product strategy?
