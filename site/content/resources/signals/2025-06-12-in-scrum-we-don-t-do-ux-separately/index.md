title: In Scrum, we don’t do UX separately
short_title: UX Integration in Scrum Sprints
description: UX is integrated into Scrum, not handled separately. Design and validation happen within Sprints and backlog refinement, supporting continuous, team-based delivery.
tldr: UX should be integrated into regular Scrum work, not handled in separate sprints or phases. Design and validation should happen continuously alongside development to support the Sprint Goal and future planning. Managers should ensure UX is part of the team’s ongoing workflow to improve learning and delivery speed.

In Scrum, we don’t do UX separately. We don’t have a “UX Sprint.” UX is part of the product. That means UX work is either:

1. Needed to meet the Sprint Goal—so it’s done during the Sprint.
2. Needed for future work—so it’s done as part of ongoing Product Backlog Refinement.

It’s that simple.

If you’re off doing speculative design in a vacuum, disconnected from the team, you’re not doing Scrum. You’re delaying learning and undermining flow. UX belongs in the real world, integrated into the delivery of value, not staged like a phase from a project plan.

Design as you go. Validate early. Iterate continuously.

Still running “design sprints”? Maybe it’s time to rethink what “done” really means for your team.
