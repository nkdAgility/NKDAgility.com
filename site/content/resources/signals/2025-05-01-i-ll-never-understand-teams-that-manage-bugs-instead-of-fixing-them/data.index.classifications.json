It directly addresses teams of practitioners, using analogies that underline the urgency of fixing bugs, aligning with principles like software craftsmanship and quality. However, it does not use the explicit term 'engineering excellence', keeping direct mentions low, and offers less depth on process frameworks or supporting metrics, hence moderate depth and alignment scores. There are no outdated references or contradictory tones, so no penalties are applied.",

Discussion is surface-level, not procedural or policy-based.",
