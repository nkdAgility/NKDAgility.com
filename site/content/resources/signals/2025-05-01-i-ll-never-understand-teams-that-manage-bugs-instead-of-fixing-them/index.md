title: I’ll never understand teams that manage bugs instead of fixing them
short_title: Fix Bugs Immediately, Don’t Manage Backlogs
description: Highlights the importance of promptly fixing software bugs instead of managing backlogs, arguing that unresolved defects harm product quality and team effectiveness.
tldr: Teams should focus on fixing bugs as soon as they are found instead of managing or prioritising them in backlogs or meetings. Delaying bug fixes leads to bigger problems and undermines the goal of delivering working software. Development managers should ensure their teams address defects promptly rather than letting them accumulate.

I’ll never understand teams that “manage” bugs instead of just fixing them.

A bug backlog? Why. Just fix them.

A meeting to discuss bug prioritisation? Stop it. Just fix them.

A ticket that’s been sitting in “QA” for weeks? Absurd. Just fix it.

Here’s the deal: Known defects are holes in the ship. You don’t argue about whether to patch them while the water pours in. If a bug is found, it gets fixed. If it’s too big, escalate it and prioritise the fix. The longer you wait, the worse it gets.

Agile is about working software. Not half-working software with a spreadsheet full of problems you hope to deal with someday.

How does your team handle bugs? Are you fixing them or just shuffling them around?
