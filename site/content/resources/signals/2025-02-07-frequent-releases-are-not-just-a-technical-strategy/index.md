Frequent releases are not just a technical strategy. They are a survival strategy.

The longer software stays in development without release, the higher the risk of wasted effort. Microsoft learned this lesson with Windows 8, investing six years into a product that failed immediately upon launch. Had they released frequently and adapted to feedback, they could have prevented billions in losses.

DORA research confirms that high-performing teams release more often, recover from failures faster, and cut costs. Frequent releases protect your company from costly missteps by ensuring you are learning from real users.

Are you mitigating risk, or are you waiting to fail?
