short_title: Frequent Releases Reduce Risk and Improve Feedback
description: Frequent software releases reduce risk, enable faster feedback, and help teams adapt to user needs, preventing costly mistakes and improving overall performance.
tldr: Frequent releases help teams learn from real users and avoid wasting effort on features that may not work, as shown by Microsoftâ€™s costly Windows 8 failure. Research shows that teams releasing often recover faster and reduce costs. To reduce risk and improve outcomes, prioritize frequent releases and adapt based on user feedback.

Frequent releases are not just a technical strategy. They are a survival strategy.

The longer software stays in development without release, the higher the risk of wasted effort. Microsoft learned this lesson with Windows 8, investing six years into a product that failed immediately upon launch. Had they released frequently and adapted to feedback, they could have prevented billions in losses.

DORA research confirms that high-performing teams release more often, recover from failures faster, and cut costs. Frequent releases protect your company from costly missteps by ensuring you are learning from real users.

Are you mitigating risk, or are you waiting to fail?
