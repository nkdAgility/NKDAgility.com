I still hear leaders talk about "hybrid Agile" like it’s the best of both worlds. Let’s be real—it’s usually the worst of both.

You can’t bolt Agile practices onto a rigid, process-heavy system and expect to move faster. That’s like trying to upgrade an old flip phone with a touchscreen—it just doesn’t work. What you get is a Frankenstein process: too slow to be Agile, too chaotic to be controlled.

The goal isn’t to “be Agile.” It’s to outmaneuver your competitors. If your system isn’t designed for rapid adaptation, you’re already losing.

The question isn’t whether you should change. It’s whether you’ll change before it’s too late.

Are you genuinely set up to pivot and seize opportunities, or are you clinging to old ways under a new name?
