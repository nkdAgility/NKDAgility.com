The discussion lacks depth regarding VSM principles, processes, or tools, and intent centers on improving visual project management, not optimising end-to-end value delivery. The audience overlap exists (teams interested in process improvement), and content is largely on-topic for workflow efficiency, but it misses key VSM-specific concepts.",

It aligns (though not directly) with the Kanban concept of making work explicit and managing flow, especially by highlighting how improper workflow modeling (i.e., misplacing blocked work) obscures real process states and inflates WIP. The content implicitly references key Kanban principles (such as WIP limits and visible flow) without explicitly mentioning the 'Definition of Workflow' as a formal construct, resulting in a moderate 'Direct Mentions' score. The alignment is substantively present since the advice supports making workflow policies explicit and adaptable. However, it does not discuss entry/exit policies or provide a deep exploration of the full 'Definition of Workflow,' lowering the 'depth' score.
