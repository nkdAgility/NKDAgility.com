Git Flow should have died years ago.

It was designed for packaged software, not modern software delivery. Yet, some teams still cling to it, drowning in:

- Long-lived develop branches
- Painful release/\* merges
- Endless hotfix/\* chaos

Every merge is an opportunity for delay, conflict, and regression. Instead of focusing on delivering value, teams are stuck babysitting branches.

Switch to GitHub Flow or Release Flow and experience the difference. Merge small. Deploy continuously. Stop wasting time on a process that was obsolete a decade ago.
