If your team is using a “Blocked” column in Azure DevOps, you’re probably doing it wrong.

Why? Because work doesn’t flow through blocked—it stops there. And once it’s there, it tends to stay there.

Instead of a blocked column, try this:

- Use a Blocked tag on work items.
- Colour-code the tag for visibility.
- Keep blocked work in its active state on the board.
- Track the frequency and causes of blockages.

This keeps the problem in sight while preventing blocked work from becoming a dumping ground. More importantly, it helps teams take action instead of waiting for work to magically resolve itself.

How does your team flag 'blocked' work?
