title: Why Using a Blocked Column in Azure DevOps Is a Mistake
short_title: Avoiding Blocked Columns in Azure DevOps
description: Explains why a “Blocked” column in Azure DevOps hinders workflow, and suggests using tags and tracking to manage blocked work more effectively and visibly.
tldr: Using a blocked column in Azure DevOps causes work to stall and be forgotten, rather than resolved. Instead, use a visible blocked tag and keep items in their active state to maintain focus and encourage action. Track blockages to address root causes and keep work moving.

If your team is using a “Blocked” column in Azure DevOps, you’re probably doing it wrong.

Why? Because work doesn’t flow through blocked—it stops there. And once it’s there, it tends to stay there.

Instead of a blocked column, try this:

- Use a Blocked tag on work items.
- Colour-code the tag for visibility.
- Keep blocked work in its active state on the board.
- Track the frequency and causes of blockages.

This keeps the problem in sight while preventing blocked work from becoming a dumping ground. More importantly, it helps teams take action instead of waiting for work to magically resolve itself.

How does your team flag 'blocked' work?
