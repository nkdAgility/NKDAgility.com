Would you hire a Junior CISO? A Junior Financial Director?

Of course not.

These roles demand mastery, not potential. So why do some think a "Junior Scrum Master" is acceptable?

Scrum Masters must demonstrate technical, business, and organisational mastery from day one. They are the glue that holds agile teams together, ensuring continuous delivery of value through expertise, not guesswork. Anything less is a liability.

They are not learning on the job; they are leading from the front, navigating complex challenges, and driving organisational change.

Stop looking for junior Scrum Masters. Find those who have already earned their stripes within a Scrum Team. Your team deserves nothing less, and your productâ€™s success depends on it. True agility comes from experience, and your Scrum Master must embody that.
