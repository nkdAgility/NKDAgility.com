Imagine you’re responsible for delivering a critical project, but every time you try to remove an obstacle, you’re told you don’t have the authority to do so.

That’s the reality for many Scrum Masters.

If you expect someone to deliver outcomes, they must have control over the factors that influence those outcomes. That means removing impediments, challenging dysfunction, and enforcing alignment where necessary.

Scrum Masters who are handcuffed by bureaucracy, overreaching managers, or a lack of executive support cannot fulfil their accountability. You can’t hold someone accountable for effectiveness while stripping them of the means to achieve it.

If your Scrum Masters aren’t empowered to act, they’re not Scrum Masters. They’re just observers.

Does your organisation give Scrum Masters the authority they need to drive real change?
