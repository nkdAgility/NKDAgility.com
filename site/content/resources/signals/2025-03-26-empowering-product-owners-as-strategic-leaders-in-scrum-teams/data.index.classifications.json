There are direct mentions of the Scrum Team and the relationship between Product Owner and Scrum Master. However, the focus is largely on the evolution of the Product Owner role, their responsibilities, and how they can be better supported. Discussion is more about team enablement through the Product Owner rather than a broad exploration of the Scrum Team accountability itself. The depth is moderateâ€”there are examples and broader reflections but little structural or process detail about the Scrum Team; it's mostly framed around the Product Owner's impact on team effectiveness. The audience is practitioners and leaders working within Scrum, aligning fairly well.
