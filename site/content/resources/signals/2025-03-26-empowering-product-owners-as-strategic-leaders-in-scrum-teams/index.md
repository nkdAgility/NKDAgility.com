The Product Owner is not a backlog manager.

A great Product Owner is a product strategist, a market expert, and a value maximiser. They don’t just prioritise features—they ensure the team is building the right product in the right way to deliver real business impact.

Yet, many organisations treat the Product Owner role as a glorified business analyst.

A strong Scrum Master doesn’t just facilitate Scrum events; they teach, coach, and mentor the Product Owner to operate like a modern product leader. That includes leveraging customer insights, articulating a strategic vision, and making data-driven decisions.

If the Product Owner is weak, the whole Scrum Team suffers.

Are we empowering Product Owners to lead, or are we just giving them Jira access and hoping for the best?
