A great Product Owner doesn’t just manage a backlog—they drive the entire product strategy. If you’re looking for a simple litmus test for what makes a strong PO, Jim Sammons’ Five A’s of Product Ownership is a great framework:

1. Accountability – Owning the product vision and backlog, not just maintaining it.
2. Awareness – Understanding customers, the market, and business priorities.
3. Acceptance – Making hard decisions and knowing when to pivot.
4. Access – Engaging with stakeholders and ensuring alignment.
5. Adaptability – Constantly inspecting and adapting based on evidence.

Too often, companies focus on tactical backlog refinement instead of strategic product management. The best POs influence at every level—shaping roadmaps, driving experimentation, and ensuring the product delivers real value.

If your Product Owner isn’t empowered to make meaningful decisions, they aren’t really a Product Owner. They’re just an administrator.

Which of these "A’s" do you think is the hardest for most POs to master?
