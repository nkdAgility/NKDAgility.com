Agile and Scrum are often misunderstood.

They don't fix your problems.  
They reveal them.

When a team struggles to produce a working product, when deliverables fall apart, when frustration bubbles up, Agile and Scrum are not failing. They’re doing exactly what they were designed to do—highlight the dysfunctions you’ve ignored.

The real work isn't in running a Daily Scrum or filling out a board.  
It’s in confronting those problems head-on, not sweeping them under the carpet.

Agile and Scrum are social technologies for building adaptive solutions, not frameworks for passive compliance.

If your system of work is broken, no certification, no Jira ticket, and no ritual will save you.

Are you ready to fix the real problems your team is signalling?
