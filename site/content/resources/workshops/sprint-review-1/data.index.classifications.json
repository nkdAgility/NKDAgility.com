It includes detailed steps for facilitation and various techniques (like Liberating Structures) that can be utilized to enhance team interaction and transparency during the review process. However, while the content heavily focuses on the implementation of these methods, it mainly describes practical execution and less on the broader conceptual framework for adapting frameworks to various organizational contexts. Therefore, it aligns well with the category but does not fully meet all the core themes, resulting in a moderate-to-high confidence score.",
