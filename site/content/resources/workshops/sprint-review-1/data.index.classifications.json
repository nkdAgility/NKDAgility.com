The depth centers on logistics, facilitation tips, and engagement practices, not on abstracting or discussing models, frameworks, or comparative analyses (Depth: 3.2). The intent is to provide practitioners with a blueprint for running an engaging Sprint Review, not to explore or explain models as conceptual representations (Intent: 2.6). The audience is primarily Scrum practitioners or facilitators, which mismatches the 'model' category's more conceptual, analytic audience (Audience: 2.8). Signal-to-noise is moderate (3.1): most of the content is relevant to Sprint Review practice, but little is related to organizational models as defined. No penalties are applied.
