# Agile leader vs traditional manager

#shorts An #agileleader has a great deal of responsibility to open the environment to change, facilitate rapid innovation cycles, and create environments where #agile teams can thrive.

Traditional managers have managed environments, sometimes micromanaged, to ensure a solid objective has been achieved.
