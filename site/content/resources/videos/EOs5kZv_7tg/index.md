# Why is Johanna a great teacher for the Professional Agile Leadership Essentials course?

At NKD Agility, Joanna Plaskonka is our #agileleadership guru and leads the 2-day workshop, as well as the 8-week immersive learning journey. She's in love with the infinite opportunities presented by #agile leadership and the perfect choice to host the course.
