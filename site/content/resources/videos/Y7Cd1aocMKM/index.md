# How effective is scrum training via digital delivery?

#scrum training is notoriously engaging, interactive, and fun. It is known for leveraging cool things, like #lego and #minecraft, to help embed the learning experience and allow people to practise #scrum in a meaningful way.

When you've spent your whole working like using #projectmanagement, the transition to an #agileframework can be transformative. It's like all the things that held you back in the past just evaporate and you've now got an approach that helps you navigate complexity and solve complex problems.

So, how do we achieve that same level of engagement, interaction, and transformative learning experience using live, online training? How effective have we become at delivering #scrumcertification courses online?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about how far we have come since the start of Covid in 2020, and how many great tools and mediums are now incorporated in the learning experience to make #scrumtraining as powerful as possible.
