# How is agile product development different to waterfall project management?

In simple or complicated environments, such as civil engineering and building bridges, traditional #projectmanagement has done a great job because we know how to build bridges, we know how much they cost, we know all the variables involved, and we know who is best positioned to build the bridge based on past performance.

In complex environments,. we don't know the answers upfront. We know that something is important but we may not know if the problem can be solved or whether it is possible to build the product. We certainly can't know all of the variables upfront and it's common for circumstances to change, requiring us to pivot rapidly and respond to customer needs or competitor activity.

The #agile industry talk about the need to shift from #project to #product, and have great case studies that demonstrate how effective #agile is at #productdevelopment in complex environments.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood describes the difference between #projectmanagement and #productdevelopment in the context of #agile environments.
