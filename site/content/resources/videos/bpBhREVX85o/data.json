    "description": "In simple or complicated environments such as civil engineering, traditional #projectmanagement is a great answer. You know what needs to be done, you know who is best positioned to do the work, and you know how long that will take and how much it will cost to do.\n\nBecause it is complicated, it tends to be linear and stable, and so it's simply a matter of running a tight ship from point A to Z to ensure you get the job done efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn complex environments, things become way tougher. You have never built the solution or solved the problem before, and so you don't know what you don't know.\n\n#agile is a process of developing a hypothesis, running an experiment, inspecting what has been created, and using the data and evidence to inform what you should do next.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how #scrum provides a framework to help #leadership teams decide which work is the most valuable, in the context of the customers they serve, and within the organizations constraints.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
