# Why did so many of the early agile transformations fail?

In 2001, the #agilemanifesto became a beacon of light for software engineers who were frustrated with the traditional management and #projectmanagement frameworks of the day.

It empowered teams to unleash their collaborative and creative powers, and create products and features that truly delighted customers. It did so with such success that many organizations were inspired to undergo an #agiletransformation in the hopes of achieving similar results.

The problem is that #agile and #scrum are relatively easy to understand but prove incredibly difficult to master. A reality that has led to many failed #agile transformations over the past 21 years.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about some of the primary reasons why an #agiletransformation fails, and what organizations could do differently to achieve a more positive outcome.
