# Do you think #immersivelearning is the future of Scrum training? If so, why?

As more industries find themselves dealing with increased #complexity, #scrum becomes a great #agileframework to help them navigate uncertainty and move forward effectively despite #complexity.

Learning #scrum can take a few hours. Learning how to implement #scrum and excel in an accountability, such as the #scrummaster, takes considerably more time and practice.

The new #scrumorg #immersivelearning experiences are proving incredibly popular with delegates and training departments alike. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why.
