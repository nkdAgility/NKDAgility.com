# Why does Minecraft make the APS course so awesome?

Traditional #projectmanagement operates by strict observance of rules, prescribed steps, and tools that track or manage output. #agile, by contrast, operates from the foundation of values and principles, and uses lightweight #agileframeworks to help teams inspect, adapt, and respond to what is most valuable to customers and the organization.

#projectmanagement is useful in simple or complicated environments but tends to fall over in complex environments, but that's where #agile comes into it's own.

The APS (Applying Professional #scrum) course is one of Martin Hinshelwood's favourite courses to deliver because it allows teams to immerse themselves in the #productdevelopment experience and work through complexity as a cohesive, collaborative, and creative team.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why he uses #minecraft to help embed the knowledge, learning outcomes, and experience of #scrum with the teams and individuals he teaches.
