# Ep 006 - Live Virtual Retrospective On PAL-e with Russell Miller

This week Russell Miller and I co-taught a Professional Agile Leadership class as a Live Virtual Classroom with Microsoft Teams and Mural. We will be chatting about the experiance or running Live Virtual Classrooms as well as the pros and cons of the technology choices and changes that we would make for the next one.
