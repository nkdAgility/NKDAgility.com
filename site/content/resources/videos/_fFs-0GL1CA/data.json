    "description": "The world of #agile is inherently complex. If building complex solutions or solving complex problems was a straightforward process of observing a formula, traditional #projectmanagement would do the trick and there would be no need for #agile or #scrum.\n\nSo, when you enter the working world as a #scrummaster or #productowner, you need guardrails that can help you progress on your journey through an apprenticeship and onto mastery. You need to invest a great deal of time and effort in learning, practicing, and receiving coaching if you are going to be great at what you do.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of certification in your journey to mastery, and how following Scrum.Org certification paths can help ensure that you are studying the right materials, listening to industry respected thought leaders, and receiving validation of your knowledge and capabilities through an official certification body.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
