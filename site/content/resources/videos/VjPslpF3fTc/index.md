NKDAgility's Immersion Training reimagines traditional classroom learning. Our approach involves:

- Incremental Classroom Learning: Short, engaging live sessions spread over several weeks, each lasting up to 4 hours. This structure allows learners to thoroughly understand each concept at a comfortable pace.
- Outcome-Based Assignments: Assignments linked to each session emphasize practical application and innovation, catering to various skill levels and backgrounds.
- Facilitated Reflections: Each class starts with a reflective session where learners discuss their assignment experiences with their Professional Scrum Trainer, fostering peer learning and actionable insights.
