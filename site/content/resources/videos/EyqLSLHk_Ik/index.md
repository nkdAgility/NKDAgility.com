# Product Development Mentoring Program

How do you create a great product if you don't know what you can't possibly know? How do you navigate uncertainty and complexity when there is so much at stake? How do you move confidently ahead when there is a great deal of volatility and ambiguity in the markets you serve?

NKD Agility have extensive experience in helping organizations create great products in complex environments, especially software-driven products and services. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood - Principal Agile consultant and Professional Scrum Trainer - walks us through the NKD Agility Product Development Mentorship program.
