# 3 best ways to wreck your Kanban adoption  Using vanity metrics.

Elevating Kanban Strategy: Beyond Vanity Metrics

The Pitfall of Ignoring Data

Implementing a Kanban strategy without leveraging the power of data is a common misstep that can significantly hamper the effectiveness of the system. Simply having a board with columns and no work-in-progress (WIP) limits does not constitute a true Kanban strategy. The key to unlocking the full potential of Kanban lies in moving beyond surface-level metrics and diving deep into meaningful data analysis.

Ditching Vanity Metrics

Vanity Metrics: Metrics such as story points, velocity, and burn-down charts often do not provide the insights needed to optimize the flow of value to customers. These metrics can distract from the real issues and improvements needed within the workflow.
The Importance of Actionable Data: To truly improve your process, it's essential to focus on metrics that allow for actionable insights. Metrics that don't lead to meaningful change are merely distractions.

Four Key Metrics for Kanban Success

Work-in-Progress (WIP): Monitoring items that have started but not yet finished helps in understanding current workload and identifying bottlenecks.
Age of Work: Determining how long work items have been in the system highlights potential delays and inefficiencies.
Delivery Rate: By tracking the number of items delivered over a set period, teams can gauge their throughput and set realistic expectations.
Cycle Time: Knowing how long it takes to deliver work items from start to finish is crucial for predicting delivery times and improving process efficiency.

Leveraging Data for Continuous Improvement

Data Collection: Utilizing digital tools like JIRA, Azure DevOps, or Trello can simplify the collection of start and end times for each piece of work, providing the foundational data needed for analysis.
Analysis and Adaptation: With the right data, teams can perform in-depth analyses to identify improvement opportunities. This cycle of transparency, inspection, and adaptation is key to evolving your Kanban system.
