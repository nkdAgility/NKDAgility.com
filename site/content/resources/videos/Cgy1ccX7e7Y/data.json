We know how to build a road, we know who is best positioned to build the road, we know how long it takes to build the road, and we have a great idea of how much it costs to build that road.\n\nWhen you step into a complex environment, everything changes because the problem you are trying to solve has never been solved before. The solution you are trying to create has never been created before. So, you don't know what you don't know, and there are way too many variables to guess upfront, so you need to approach things differently.\n\nThis is where things get tricky because it doesn't help to simply throw your hands up and tell #leadership and #executive teams that you don't know, and cannot know, until you have actually solved the problem or built the solution.\n\nThere has to be a bridge. A way of moving effectively from the initial starting point, through each iteration and evolution, until you have created the most valuable product or solved the most compelling problem.\n\n#agile is a great approach to this kind of #productdevelopment and has proven itself time and again over the past 25 years. So, if your organization hire an #agileconsultant to achieve increased #businessagility and critical business objectives, how will you know that the engagement is creating value?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood provides some examples of valuable outcomes that could emerge from an #agileconsulting engagement.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/\n \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
