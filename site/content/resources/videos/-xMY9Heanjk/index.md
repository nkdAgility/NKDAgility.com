# What is the hardest part of working with a brand new scrum team?

#agile has had a significant impact on #productdevelopment over the past 21 years, but is still confused with a #projectmanagement methodology rather than being a guiding light for #businessagility.

So, when organizations decide to run a trial or pilot with #scrum, there is often a steep learning curve and difficult period of adjustment because teams are used to being told what to do, how to do it, and within what cost and time constraints it needs to be done.

To all of a sudden be the experts who make those decisions and leverage their knowledge, skills, and capabilities to create a product that has never been created before or solve a problem that has never been solved before can be incredibly tough.

So, what's the hardest part of getting started? What is the most difficult thing to overcome when transitioning to #scrum?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the hardest part of working with a new scrum team, and what makes the difference in the quest to move from newbie to mastery.
