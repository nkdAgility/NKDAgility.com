# Why do you think that 4 half days is a better format than 2 full days?

There are significant differences between a #projectmanagement environment and an #agile, #scrum environment. There are also significant differences between a #projectmanager and a #scrummaster or #productowner, and so you need immersive, transformative training to help you make that leap.

Traditionally, the #scrumorg #scrumtraining has focused on 2 full days to obtain your #scrummaster or #productowner #certification, but many of the more progressive #professionalscrumtrainers have extended the training to 4, and in some cases, 8 half days of training rather than the 2 full days.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why he prefers the 4-half day training format over the 2 full-day training formats.
