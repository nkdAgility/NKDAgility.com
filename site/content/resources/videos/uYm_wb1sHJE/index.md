# What is the sprint review workshop and how will it help organizations?

The #sprintreview is a critical event in #scrum because it's the moment where the #scrumteam introduce the customer and stakeholders to the work that has been completed in the #sprint.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the new Sprint Review workshops that have been created by NKD Agility, and how they are designed to help scrum teams shine in sprint reviews moving forward.
