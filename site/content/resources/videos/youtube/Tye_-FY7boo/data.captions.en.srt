1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,160
one of the five things that I would

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:10,719
teach a new product owner is about

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,280
Vision value and validation one of the

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,520
common things that happen in

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,800
organizations as they start to move from

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:24,560
focusing on Project delivery to focusing

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,599
on product management is that they um

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,119
they take out all of the things that you

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,040
think of as traditional project manager

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,360
M right that you think of as traditional

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,960
project management like the the the

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,320
milestones

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,360
and dates and Gant charts and project

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,960
plans we we take out those things cuz

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,920
they're not agile but

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,719
then most organizations don't replace

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,520
them with anything and you end up with

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,800
this vacuum in the Middle where we're

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,280
not going to do any planning we're not

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,840
going to do any forecasting we're not

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,760
going to really understand what it is

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,159
we're doing we're not going to explain

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,760
to people what it is they need to do

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,200
we're not going we're just instead of

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,439
giving them the plan we're just going to

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,880
say here's the product get on with it

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,400
and then we expect magic to happen and

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,520
that is an absolute recipe for disaster

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,799
don't do that right what you need to do

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,799
is you need to fill that vacuum and as a

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,640
new product owner this is the key part

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,920
for you to understand as well as for you

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,920
to be able to engage communicate to

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,560
other people in the organization up up

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,600
down sideways whatever it is do you

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,799
understand the vision of your product do

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,680
you understand what it's trying to

38
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:48,439
achieve if you don't that's step number

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,000
one figure out um what the what the

40
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,600
value is in your product what's the

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,079
vision right what is it you're trying to

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
achieve where you going what's your

43
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,520
North Star right once you figured out

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
that once you figured out that and you

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,159
can communicate it right you have to

46
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,280
learn to speak in front of people and

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,280
engage people in that story because you

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,760
need to engage them in that story then

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,879
you need to think about the value that

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,599
you're going to deliver are the things

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
that you're delivering in the product

52
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,319
actually

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,519
serving that Vision are they working

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,599
towards that Vision what is it that

55
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,040
you're trying to to to achieve and then

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,519
you need to think about validation how

57
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,120
are you going to check

58
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,879
that you're actually making progress

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,599
towards those key ideas that you're

60
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,519
actually making progress towards your

61
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,560
vision with the value that you're is the

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,400
value you're delivering even value at

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,080
all you might think it's value but do

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,400
your customers do your stakeholders do

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,280
the people who are using it think that

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,400
it's value right so that's this is this

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,159
is a a a a a key major thing that we

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,720
talk about in the professional scrum

69
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,680
product owner class we dive even deeper

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,680
in the advanced product owner class but

71
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,200
ultimately that Vision value and

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,519
validation is what's supposed to fill

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,000
that product management vacuum that

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,360
occurs when we make that

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,200
transition from project management

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,159
towards product management and that that

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,480
doesn't mean that there are no project

78
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,519
managers anymore that is absolutely not

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,120
the case project management um is not

80
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,920
being deleted uh from our of working it

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,560
just becomes one of the tools the focus

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,239
is the product we want to deliver a

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,680
product we want to deliver the most

84
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,080
successful most valuable product that

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,799
maximizes the value Creation in our

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,680
organization right rather than focusing

87
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,200
on the project which you can be on time

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,799
on budget with the features that we

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,920
asked for and still be unsuccessful

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,000
right and from a project manager's

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,879
perspective from a projects perspective

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,400
we can still be successful and not have

93
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,879
delivered any value that's why that

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,439
transition that focus and that's why

95
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,760
when you take away those pillars that

96
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,040
project management uses you need to

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,040
replace it with something else and the

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,120
answer is Vision value and validation if

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,280
you find it hard to

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,800
identify how you can enable Vision value

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,320
and validation within your organization

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:38,280
my team at naked agility can help you or

your ability to deliver value and

106
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
