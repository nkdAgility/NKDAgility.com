    "reasoning": "The content is exclusively focused on the role of the Scrum Master as a servant leader, the value of autonomy within Scrum teams, and misconceptions about the role. There are no direct mentions of Objective Key Results (OKRs), nor does the discussion align conceptually with OKR principles or their implementation. The purpose, depth, and audience alignment all center on Scrum roles and leadership, not outcome-driven measurement or OKR frameworks. While there is some thematic overlap in the emphasis on outcomes and transparency, these are expressed strictly in terms of Scrum team dynamics, not as OKR-aligned concepts. Therefore, confidence in alignment with the Objective Key Results category is extremely low.",

    "reasoning": "The content does not directly mention 'Agentic Engineering' but extensively discusses servant leadership and team empowerment within Scrum, aligning with core category themes such as developer agency and decision decentralization. The narrative dives into misconceptions and refutes authoritative models in favor of autonomy, facilitating adaptive team environments—echoing agentic principles. However, it does not reference systemic observability, DevOps, AI integration, or continuous value delivery. Its primary intent and advice focus on maximizing autonomy and agency within teams rather than broader engineering design, and the audience consists of practitioners directly aligned with the category’s target. Depth is moderate, mostly exploring one axis of agency (Scrum team roles), and signal is high as few tangents occur. No penalties apply: content is timely and not contradictory.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the piece doesn't name Agentic Engineering, it prioritizes autonomy, empowerment, and servant leadership—strongly aligning with the category’s emphasis on maximizing agency within engineering teams. However, its focus is limited to Scrum Master practices, omitting technical and AI aspects.",

    "reasoning": "The content exclusively discusses the servant leadership role of the Scrum Master, addressing common misconceptions and emphasizing empowerment, autonomy, and facilitation in agile teams. There are no references to AI, autonomous agents, contextual intelligence, agentic system integration, or modern engineering/agent governance practices. The intent is squarely on clarifying Scrum Master responsibilities and not on Agentic Software Delivery. The audience is technical and agile-oriented, which partially overlaps with the target audience of the evaluated category, but all themes stay solidly within human-centric, traditional Scrum Mastership, not agentic or AI-augmented delivery. No points warrant deduction for outdatedness or contradiction.",
