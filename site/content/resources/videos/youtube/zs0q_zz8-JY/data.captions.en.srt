00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
I think the biggest misconception about

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,980
a scrum Master is that they're they're

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,460
an order Giver they're somehow in

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,639
control of anything

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,859
um ideally the scrum master has no

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,080
Authority whatsoever

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,539
um within the context of the team and in

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,939
fact is selected by the team so you

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,359
could say that there are servant leader

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,640
a leader who serves for the team

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,380
um so the biggest misconception is that

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,640
they're in charge of anything that

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
people should be giving them status

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,360
updates that they should be writing

15
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,820
reports these are all ridiculous things

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,640
that are not part of being a scrum

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,559
master and if you want to know more come

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,040
to the advanced scrum master class and

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,040
find out
