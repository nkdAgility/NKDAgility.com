    "reasoning": "The content is focused on immersive learning in Scrum, blending theory and practice to foster deeper understanding, critical thinking, and continuous improvement for Agile teams. While it touches on maximizing team autonomy, decision-making, and continuous value delivery—concepts adjacent to Agentic Engineering—it does not explicitly discuss the deliberate design of engineering practices to maximize human and AI agency, DevOps-Infused Craft, or ethical AI. There are indirect alignments, such as discussion of autonomy, reflection, and continuous improvement, which are thematically relevant, but the core Agentic Engineering topics (e.g., observability, AI collaboration, ethical autonomy, automation as a practice) are notably absent. Audience fit is strong, being aimed at practitioners interested in modern Scrum and Agile, and the signal is high, but direct category mentions and conceptual depth around Agentic Engineering are low.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on immersive Scrum learning, emphasizing theory-practice integration and team improvement. While it supports themes like autonomy and continuous improvement, it lacks direct discussion of the deliberate, systemic engineering of agency in human or AI contexts. Alignment to Agentic Engineering is limited and mostly tangential.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on immersive learning within Scrum and Agile contexts, emphasizing theory and hands-on experience for team improvement. However, it does not mention or explore agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or related agentic practices. There are no references to integration between AI and human expertise, contextual intelligence, or any agent-driven delivery mechanisms. The topics remain purely in human learning, training, and Scrum methodology, outside the domain of agentic software delivery. The audience (Scrum practitioners, trainers) and content are not geared toward agentic software delivery practitioners. No penalties were applied as the tone and references are contemporary and neutral, but nearly all scoring is necessarily low due to lack of conceptual connection or mention.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is centered on immersive human learning in Scrum, not agentic software delivery. No agentic principles, AI agents, or related themes are present. The fit is extremely low and not aligned with the assigned category.",
