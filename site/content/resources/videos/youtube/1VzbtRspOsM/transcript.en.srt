1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,080
I think it's very difficult for aspiring

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,920
agile

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:13,519
leaders to get

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,799
the time the space needed to have a lot

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,439
of the conversations that really need to

6
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:23,480
be had in the leadership space in their

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:28,119
organization and the the the p e is a

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,119
fantastic class that enables that that

9
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,000
space to have those

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,280
conversations but doesn't necessarily

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
always result in

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,840
space that to actually do the things uh

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,879
differently that you want to do or

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,320
practice the things that you want to

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,079
practice and that's where taking this uh

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,230
uh the the the the traditional Pali

17
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,440
class and exploding it

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,879
[Music]

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:06,040
into a a a six week immersive

20
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:09,439
class enables more more time for

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,720
people's thought processes right to to

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,720
adopt some of these new ideas for people

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,280
to try things in between the class

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,680
specifically the assignments would be

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,680
would be something that they they're

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
going to definitely try they might try

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,079
other things that we talked about in the

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,680
in the in the course but the assignment

29
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,360
is a specific thing here go try this go

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,119
figure out this how does this happen in

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,640
your

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,720
organization um and then bring that back

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,720
around into a a group of their peers

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,520
whether it's a public class and there's

35
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,680
leaders from lots of different aspiring

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,079
leaders from lots of different

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,520
organizations or it's a private class

38
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,360
where you've got the leadership for your

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,479
organization in that private class um

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,000
that that coming back around and

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,479
debriefing those those assignments and

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,520
also being able to if you did try other

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,319
things being able to ask those questions

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,039
at that point this is I tried this uh we

45
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,520
looked at this idea and it didn't work

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,000
um we tried to do this level of

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,560
Delegation how do we do this differently

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,599
so that we can get more Buy in from the

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:26,400
people that are doing it and that

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:31,440
collaborative experience is really the

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:37,480
the the why the pal immersive class is

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,200
such a great fit for people who are in

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,319
management or leadership positions

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,319
inside of their organization and they

55
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:49,560
want to ad adopt those agile ideas that

56
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,000
they see

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,800
organizations out there people out there

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,560
being able to do and getting so much

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,239
value from how do we get the same value

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,519
in our organization from those

61
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,360
conversations how do we change the way

62
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,280
we do things to enable the people in our

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,560
organizations um to to take more more

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,840
accountability um to to take more

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
ownership of the thing that they're

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
working on to be more invested and

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,280
connected with the work that they're

68
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:23,280
doing um and the pal E class is um an

69
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,599
experience that allows you to understand

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,920
how all of those things are connected

71
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,200
together and perhaps reflect on the way

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,319
your organization currently does things

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,560
and how that might inhibit the ability

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,080
for teams U to maximize the value that

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,080
they deliver to to stakeholders your

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,879
