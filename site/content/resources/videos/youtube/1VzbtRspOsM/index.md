# Why is the PAL E immersivelearning experience such a great fit for aspiring agileleaders?

If you're new to #agile or #scrum, the transition from traditional #manager to #agileleadership can be daunting. In some ways, it's counterintuitive to everything you have learned ascending the corporate ladder.

The culture, mindset and behaviours are completely different.

We've found that the PAL-E #immersivelearning course is a great fit for aspiring #agileleaders because it offers the perfect blend of #scrumtraining and #agilecoaching. You aren't just being fed information, you get to test it, bring your questions and problems into the classroom, and get insight from your #professionalscrumtrainer that helps you adopt and implement #agileleadership practices more effectively.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why the PAL-E immersive learning experience is a powerful journey for managers embarking on an #agile career.
