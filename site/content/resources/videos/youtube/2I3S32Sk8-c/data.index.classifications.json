    "reasoning": "The content primarily focuses on guiding a scrum team through their initial 4 weeks, emphasizing the execution of scrum roles, events, and artefacts, which are more about the application of a framework than the concept of enduring capabilities. While there are mentions of continuous improvement and organizational change, the overall discussion revolves around specific practices and immediate actions rather than cultivating sustainable competencies or capabilities within the team or organization. The connection to broader capability themes is present but weak, and the depth of discussion about capability as a systemic element is limited.",

    "reasoning": "The content does not mention Service Level Expectation (SLE) by name or discuss its calculation, usage, or definition. There are zero explicit references to SLE, and no indirect mention of its principles, such as forecasting delivery times with probabilities, analyzing cycle time data for predictability, or referencing sources on SLE. The main focus is on foundational Scrum practices, team learning, and continuous improvement, which aligns generally with the spirit of SLE’s contributions to transparency and improvement, but only in the broadest sense. The scope never narrows to cycle time measurement, setting service expectations, or any SLE-specific practice. Audience is somewhat related as new Scrum teams might eventually encounter SLE, but this content is introductory and offers no signal for SLE-specific knowledge or intent. No penalties are applied as the content is current and neutral in tone, but the overall score is extremely low as per the required formula, reflecting the category’s strict definition and scope.",
