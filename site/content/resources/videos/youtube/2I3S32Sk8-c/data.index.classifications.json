    "reasoning": "The content is focused entirely on basic Scrum team practices, habits, and learning approaches. There is no mention of AI, agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery frameworks. The discussion is relevant to software delivery teams but remains within classic Agile and Scrum boundaries, focusing on foundational workflow, retrospectives, experimentation, and organizational impediments, not proactive intelligent systems, agent integration, or AI support. Audience (software teams) overlaps slightly, but the main theme, direct mentions, and conceptual depth are unrelated to the 'Agentic Software Delivery' definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The topic is strictly classic Scrum onboarding and practical advice; it contains no discussion of AI, autonomous agents, or proactive intelligent delivery methods, so it does NOT fit the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
