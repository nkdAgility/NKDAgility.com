1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,700
so how

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,299
what should a scrum team do

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,240
within their first four weeks that's a

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,460
really interesting question because if

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,480
if they're intent

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,760
is to as a team is to try scrum

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,019
then what I suggest they do within their

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,260
first four weeks is try scrum right the

9
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,140
the the there are all sorts of great

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,719
reasons why we shouldn't do some of the

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,620
things in scrum there's reasons why we

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,660
shouldn't have uh as much Focus as we

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,160
would like on the topic right because we

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,620
get multiple things that we have to show

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,820
progress on there's lots of good reasons

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,559
why

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,300
um we CA we can't have a single product

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,899
owner it has to be multiple people

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,800
there's lots of good reasons why

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,219
um

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,320
we can't have a a single unified backlog

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,360
because we're working on too much stuff

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,979
and there's a reason why we can't have a

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,900
product goal because you know we can't

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,720
decide what it is we're working on

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,520
and I think all of those are just

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:21,680
excuses for not being able to find Focus

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,799
you know commitment right to to to to to

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,939
change dare dare to change the way we do

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,780
things

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,520
in order to try something different and

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,579
see if it works for us

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,420
so my advice for for teams just starting

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,180
out in scrum and is do that right just

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,820
do scrum a great

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,400
um I have a great set of exercises that

37
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,640
I do with teams I have a scrum startup

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,700
exercise that I do happy to share it

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,399
with anybody that's that's interested

40
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,079
um and what I basically do is I teach I

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,060
teach scrum and then provide the startup

42
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,700
exercise they see what scrum is supposed

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,439
to look like again the EPS is great for

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,619
that right

45
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,140
um and then have them have the people

46
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,560
that are doing the work that now

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,660
understand scrum create organizational

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,340
change backlog

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,739
right that's something you can do in the

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,280
first four weeks if we're going to try

51
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:25,260
and do scrum do it and write down every

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,780
reason you can't

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,940
right write down every friction that you

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,819
hit write down everything that that

55
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,860
needs to change in your organization in

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,379
order to be able to do this thing and

57
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,420
make that list open and transparent to

58
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,519
leadership so that they can see what's

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,160
getting in your way because quite often

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,720
they can't it's very opaque to them make

61
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,340
it transparent right that's the very

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,620
essence of scrum is increasing

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,099
transparency so we can see what's going

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,360
on and perhaps do something about it

65
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,360
stop moving my advice
