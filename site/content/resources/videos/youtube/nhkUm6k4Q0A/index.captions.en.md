If you want to be an agile coach, one thing you must be is agnostic in your practices. While you may have a favourite (mine is Scrum), you need to ensure that the team, the people you're working with, are able to choose the most effective practices that work for them. And that means sometimes not picking the one that you like. You want to encourage and enable them to understand the principles that underpin the lean principles, the agile principles, and perhaps the Scrum principles as well, to enable them to make better choices.
