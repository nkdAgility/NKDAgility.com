    "reasoning": "The content is centered on agile coaching agnosticism, promoting flexibility in framework adoption. While it references Lean principles like 'delivering value to the customer' and encourages teams to ask about customer value, it largely focuses on team-level practice selection, not systematically on defining, measuring, and using customer outcomes to drive delivery. There is an emphasis on continuous improvement and adaptability, but customer focus is not the explicit or sustained core. Mentions are sparse and indirect; depth on actionable customer-centric feedback loops or metric-based prioritization is limited. Audience is technical/practitioner-aligned and intent supports improvement, but not primarily through a customer outcome lens.",

The emphasis is on coaching flexibility, practice agnosticism, and empowering teams to choose/adapt based on context—this is contrary to the strict focus on first principles as immutable truths. There are no explicit discussions distinguishing first principles from heuristics or describing consequences of violating immutable constraints; instead, principles are framed as supportive context for team choice. The depth score reflects some exploration of underlying theory, but it remains surface-level and context-driven. The signal score is moderate, as the audience is well aligned (coaches/practitioners), but the noise comes from the content’s orientation toward flexible, team-driven experimentation and values-centric approaches, which are outside the strict first principles remit.",
