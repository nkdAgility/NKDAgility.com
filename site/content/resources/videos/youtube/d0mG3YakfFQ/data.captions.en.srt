00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,880
hi i'm michelle chronister i work for

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,080
usa.gov here at the us general services

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
administration

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,040
and we're in the process of

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,559
restructuring some content on our

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,719
homepage and we created some wireframes

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,640
and we wanted to just do a real

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
quick and dirty simple test that was

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,160
pretty lo-fi so hopefully we could get

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,680
some honest feedback and people didn't

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,840
think that they were gonna hurt our

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,199
feelings with the you know really

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
polished final product so what we did is

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,760
we printed out our wireframe for mobile

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
on a really long

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
piece of paper

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
it's just you know text boxes nothing

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,680
super fancy

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,399
and we i took a manila folder

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,559
and i taped a

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
picture of a phone to it and i cut out a

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,039
window

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,079
and then what i did was i tested people

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,440
in the hallway who were willing to give

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,399
us five minutes

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,239
and i you know had a trusty test script

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
and i asked them some basic questions

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,799
about you know where they would go to

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
find things um and the reason we did the

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,960
folder with the cutout is because you

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
know just showing this big long piece of

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,520
paper for mobile is kind of overwhelming

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,119
but this allows people to get a sense of

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,920
you know what they would see on their

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,840
phone at any time and if people said oh

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
i would click here i'd say okay well if

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
you clicked here this is what happened

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,360
and then i'd move the paper and then say

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
you know is that what you expected to

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
happen and they would say like yeah i

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,360
did or no and then we continue with the

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
test and i would let them move it up and

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,560
down i would move it up and down if they

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,799
did something where

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
it would move for them automatically

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,119
so we did this for both mobile and then

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,759
on the other side of the folder we have

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,920
a cut out for tablet so we did mobile

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,479
and tablet and it's exactly the same we

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,479
just did a printout of tablet resolution

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
and we put it in the

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
folder and we did the same deal we asked

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
the same questions um you know we would

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,000
move it we would let them move it

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
it's definitely not perfect it's kind of

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
clunky

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
and it wasn't meant to be perfect

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
because we were hoping that if it was

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
really

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
uh

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,840
really simple and not too advanced that

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
we might get honest feedback we learned

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
a lot from doing this we did make a few

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,239
changes to this and then the next round

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,640
of testing we did instead of using the

66
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,120
paper we used a simple wireframe but we

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,720
put it on a mobile phone as a pdf and

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
then we gave them the phone and actually

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,239
let them scroll up and down so we could

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,360
see the behavior with a real touch

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,800
device

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,239
it was actually very similar so it

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
confirmed a lot of the things we found

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,440
from this test

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
obviously with the improvements we made

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,879
those were no longer a problem but we

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
found a few other issues so it was

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,360
really helpful it took about five

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,440
minutes to make this and you know zero

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
dollars so i would definitely recommend

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,640
it if you're looking for a creative and

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
cheap way of testing something
