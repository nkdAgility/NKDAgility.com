While it touches upon assessing readiness and embracing risk, it largely remains at a high-level discussion about transformation and cultural readiness without delving into specific methodologies or practices like Scrum, Kanban, or Lean. Thus, while it is relevant to the topic, it lacks the necessary depth and direct focus on the category of Method.",

While it addresses concepts relevant to Agile transformation, such as organizational culture and readiness, it does not delve into any conceptual models that inform decision-making or systems thinking in Agile contexts.
