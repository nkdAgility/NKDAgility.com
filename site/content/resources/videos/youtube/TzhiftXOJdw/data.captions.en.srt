1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,940
so the the question is within the

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,120
context of the changing world and

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,640
changing changing economic situation

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,340
what what needs to happen before

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,260
traditional organizations

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,800
um can consider agile

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,000
they they need to be really so there's

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,920
kind of

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,559
um two two ways to adopt agile right

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,440
there's the there's the wholehearted we

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,260
want to change the way we do things to

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,440
have happier people uh more productive

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,320
teams uh be able to adapt to changing

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,079
Market needs as quickly as possible in

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,739
which case you're you're you're taking

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,440
apart your existing hierarchical command

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,300
and control system a decentralizing and

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,059
democratizing the workforce to be able

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,059
to to respond more quickly to the market

20
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,519
needs that that's a lot of work that's a

21
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,140
huge amount of risk for your business

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,000
right because you're changing

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,220
fundamentally the way the way that you

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,979
do things across the board

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,140
um but that that is what agility is all

26
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,600
about and inside of agility there are

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,400
the the big topic of agility or the big

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,280
topic of devops there are a whole bunch

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,159
of tools to try and help you with this

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,960
right the the the everybody talks about

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,460
the tools as the point but they're not

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,040
the point even agile's not the point

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,119
it's responding to market right

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,400
um but

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,560
there's the other type of agile that

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,799
lots of large traditional organizations

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,060
adopt at least initially

38
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,900
um and that's kind of like gym

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,880
membership agile right where where

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,399
you're you're you're you know you pay

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,200
the membership to the to the gym so you

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,820
can tell everybody that you you go to

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,619
the gym but you don't actually go to the

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,060
gym right

45
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,700
um you're just paying a lot of money for

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,360
for for nothing and that's how most big

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,399
organizations seem at least

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,380
observationally seem to be

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,300
um adopting agile and I get it it's hard

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,619
and it's scary to change the way we do

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,720
things

52
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,360
um but fundamentally if your competitors

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,379
are willing to accept that hard scary

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,000
thing before you are then they're the

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,700
ones that are going to be responding to

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,360
market demand when you can't they're the

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,980
ones that are going to be uh creating

58
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,900
environments for people to work in that

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,819
are much more conducive to the way

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,640
people want to work and engage with

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,860
their companies today most young people

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,540
want to work for companies and they want

63
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,300
to feel like the work that they do

64
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,480
matters that they have purpose in what

65
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,800
they do that they they believe in they

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,440
believe in the company that they're

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
working for and and that's just not the

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
case for most big traditional

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
organizations

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,980
um so I I I think it's really important

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,040
to have that consideration are you as an

72
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,519
organization actually ready to move

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,040
towards agility or are you not yet are

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,300
you ready to respond quickly to Market

75
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,800
changes or are you not yet right these

76
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,500
These are important important questions

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,180
to answer and by all means you know pay

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,400
a bit of lip service

79
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,760
dip your toe in the water but realize

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
that those things do not result in the

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,159
thing that you were dipping you're in

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,720
your toe in the water to achieve you're

83
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,659
only going to be able to achieve that

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,280
with wholesale systemic and radical

85
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,019
change of the way your organization

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,200
functions to a more decentralized

87
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,200
decentralized model
