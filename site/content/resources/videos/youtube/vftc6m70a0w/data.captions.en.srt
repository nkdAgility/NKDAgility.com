1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,000
so one of the Seven Virtues of agility

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,639
is Chastity and in in our context in the

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,560
agile context at Chassy is really about

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:19,279
taking taking your time right don't jump

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:22,880
into um thinking that you've been

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,560
successful doing uh uh we're doing agile

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,320
and we're going to we're going to take

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,240
all the things you want to think about

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,399
the impact and the effect within your

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,239
organization of the changes that you

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:40,840
make so there are there are loads of

12
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,160
implications of agile that go far beyond

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,680
the actual

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,199
mechanisms um for your

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,320
organization um so things for example

16
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,760
like the

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,480
democratization of the workplace

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,640
involving more people in the decision

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,320
making is something that you need to

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,519
take time over you need to think about

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,519
how you're going to change your

22
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,119
organization you need to involve the

23
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,280
people in your

24
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:10,400
organization in that story otherwise

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,640
they're not going to be interested uh in

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,320
what it is you're trying to achieve

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,080
nobody really cares about your goals

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,680
they care about their own goals and the

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,240
way you get them to care about your

30
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,400
goals is you make their goals your goals

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,680
right you you they want to be part of

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,439
that story so taking your time and

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,680

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,439
