In the realm of agility, one of the seven virtues that often gets overlooked is chastity. Now, before you raise an eyebrow, let me clarify: in our agile context, chastity is all about taking your time. It’s about resisting the urge to rush into the implementation of agile practices without fully understanding the implications of those changes within your organisation.

When we think we’ve successfully adopted agile, it’s tempting to dive headfirst into the myriad of tools and processes available. However, I’ve learned through experience that this can lead to a superficial understanding of agility. The truth is, the implications of agile extend far beyond just the mechanics of how we work. Here are a few key points to consider:

- **Democratisation of the Workplace**: Agile encourages involving more people in decision-making. This isn’t just a box-ticking exercise; it requires careful thought and planning. You need to consider how to effectively change your organisation’s culture to embrace this inclusivity.

- **Engagement with Stakeholders**: It’s crucial to involve your team in the narrative of change. If you don’t, you risk alienating them. Remember, nobody truly cares about your organisational goals unless they see how those goals align with their own. The way to bridge this gap is to make their goals your goals. This shared vision fosters a sense of ownership and commitment.

- **Utilising Tools for Inclusivity**: There are fantastic tools out there, such as Open Space Agility, that can facilitate this inclusive decision-making process. These tools allow everyone in your organisation to contribute to the journey towards greater agility, ensuring that the transition is not just top-down but a collective effort.

Taking your time to thoughtfully implement these changes is essential. It’s this deliberate approach that will enable you to extract the maximum value from your agile strategies.
