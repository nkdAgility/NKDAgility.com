1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,360
one of the Seven Virtues of agility is

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,040
kindness kindness could be uh compassion

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,799
it could be benevolence it could be

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,960
empathy um and it could be directed in a

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,359
number of different places within our

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,760
organization uh the two key things that

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm thinking about uh one is the

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,640
customer right we have this Relentless

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,280
customer focus that we're trying to

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,680
deliver something that adds value in the

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,760
market right and for that we need to

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,719
focus on the customer we need to be

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,399
compassionate about the customers issues

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
and their difficulties and what it is

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,199
they're trying to achieve that could be

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,800
you know when dealing with bug reports

17
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,079
or it could be just with engaging with

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,079
them and talking to them about the

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,719
problems that they're encountering and

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,960
trying to solve within our within our

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,440
product domain um and we want to be

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
benevolent we want to be seen as we're

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,199
providing ing them with something that

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,840
helps enable them to do something else

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:13,680
if they see our product as a burden or

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
they see our product as um I don't know

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,960
what the what's the cost version of

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,280
Burden for me burden's Broad and then

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,640
there's a cost like a cost center if

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,159
they see your product as a cost center

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,960
then um they're they're not going to

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,680
think of your product with kindness um

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,560
and you're probably not thinking of them

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,759
with kindness right um so that

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
Relentless customer focus building

36
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,960
empathy with your customers why do

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,079
people queue up outside of an Apple

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,920
store to buy the latest product it's not

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,399
absolutely not because they have the

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,360
best products it's because there's an

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
empathetic connection between the

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,159
customers and the company and the

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,759
products that they're trying to create

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,840
and the vision and the outcome that the

45
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,439
company has so building those stories is

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,000
really important

47
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,000
um and you don't do that

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,400
by doing something negative towards your

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,160
customers you don't do that by screwing

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,239
them over right you do that by building

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,959
again trust right building trust with

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,640
the customers with kindness the the

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,920
other side that I was thinking of um was

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,360
the developers are you the people doing

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,120
the work are we building compassion and

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,040
benevolence and empathy with them how do

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,200
our employees see our organization what

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,040
do they think about our organization um

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,280
I was I was um listening to Richard

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,159
Branson um and he did a a a talk and he

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,959
was talking about that your employee

62
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,959
happiness is a leading indicator of your

63
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,560
customers

64
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,800
happiness right if your employees are

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,680
unhappy but your customers are happy it

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,799
won't be long till your customers are

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,239
also

68
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,200
unhappy if your employees are happy but

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,040
your customers are unhappy it won't be

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,040
long till your customers are happy

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,959
because people that are happy and

72
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,040
engaged do the right thing they do the

73
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,879
thing that helps other people rather

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,840
than you know kind of be dismissive and

75
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,040
disgruntled and right you need people to

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,560
think with kindness and in order to do

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,400
that you need to demon demate that that

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,439
compassion that benevolence that empathy

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200

80
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:42,400
to your employees and they will then

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:47,000
