1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,720
we're going to install the release

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,120
management tools on my server btar here

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,519
and I'm going to start with the server

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,440
then do the client and then install the

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,680
deployment agent and set that up um so

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,680
let's get going with the

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,680
server it is a fairly straightforward um

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,960
install process it's a very small

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,960
install so let me just get that

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
going

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,480
awesome completed really quickly so we

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,920
want to launch that and configure it so

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,920
let's do

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,719
that now we have the configuration tool

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,760
up and we can um I have very few

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,559
settings to fill out I'm going to use

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,199
network service um I I prefer having

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,280
everything the default and everything on

19
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,760
one server in this environment so that

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,280
should be no bother and the web service

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,439
port I'm going to leave as the default

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,320
which is a th and then everybody knows

23
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,680
where it is and I need to put the DB

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,680
server

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,439
in and as it's just the local

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,479
server I can just put in the server name

27
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,479
and click uh

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,040
go here we go

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,799
so now we have a a release management

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
server all set up and configured it very

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,240
straightforward we're going to install

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,720
the client um so let me just run this

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,040
client installer again it's a very small

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
install we're doing it all in the one

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,119
server so there probably some of the

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,119
bits are already on

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,880
there there we go release management

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,799
clients installed I'm going to spin that

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,360
up and just do a a couple of config

40
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,920
configuration

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,000
steps here we go and as uh this is the

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,360
local uh machine we can just leave that

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,479
at Local Host we could change it the

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,479
server name and I'm just going to leave

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,120
it okay now we have the release

46
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,959
management client installed I'm just

47
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,080
going to pop over to

48
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:27,120
Administration and and going to go to um

49
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:31,360
the manage TFS I'm going to add the TFS

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,440
server or local TFS server so

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,760
oh I forgot the

52
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
beat and our default

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,720
collection is default collection um let

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,720
me verify that and that will fail and we

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,760
need to put in an account that's going

56
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,760
to be used to access this so in this

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,200
case I can actually pick our TFS service

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
account

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,120
always make sure you got the password

60
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,440
right okay so we put in our TFS service

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,200
account and we hit the

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,360
verify so the error message access

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,239
denied um TFS service needs the

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,319
following permission make requests on

65
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,080
behalf of others needs to actually be uh

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,159
applied at the collection level only so

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,159
let me open up uh

68
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
TFS

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,799
and to make things uh uh a little bit

70
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,360
more manageable at the TFS level I'm

71
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,360
going to create a new

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
group

73
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,000
called release management service

74
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,599
accounts and then I'm going to go to the

75
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,920
collection

76
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,879
level and I'm going to administer

77
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,120
security and I'm going to add that

78
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,840
security group that I just created so

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,239
release management service accounts and

80
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm going to give it just the permission

81
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,919
to make requests on behalf of others now

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,600
you can apply this at the server level

83
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,000
uh but that's not recommended as it

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
gives uh uh somebody too much power at

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
the server level and if you make it just

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,400
at the collection

87
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,840
level there we go and then go to our um

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,520
um group group membership our release

89
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,880
management service accounts group and we

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,440
can add in whatever accounts we need um

91
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,800
at this level so I'm just going to add

92
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,800
in TF

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,520
service and now if we head on over to

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,400
release management and hit the verify

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,840
button we get our green Teck and all is

96
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,880
good so now I've added the the

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,759
collection in um I can have uh multiple

98
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,120
users access this and I'm just going to

99
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,320
add a group of users cuz the only person

100
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,320
that can access it right now is

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,400
me good Dem with

102
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,960
users add that in and if I go to manage

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,360
users I have a bunch of users that have

104
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,360
been given

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,680
permission awesome now we've got the

106
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,120
client installed um we can go over and

107
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,639
install the rest of the services

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,600
so we're now going to install the um

109
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,919
deployment

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,440
agent so if I just run the deployment

111
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,919
agent

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,400
here again it's a very small install

113
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:45,400
shouldn't take

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,680
long and there we go and we'll launch

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,680
the configuration

116
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,479
tool and in here again I'm going to pick

117
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,160
network service cuz I like to keep

118
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:04,520
things simple and we have to type the

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,520
URL of our release management

120
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,199
server and that should get us

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,560
there awesome we also have the release

122
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,560
management agent

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:31,400
configured now if I open up the client

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
tool

125
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
open up the RE Management client

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,720
tool and go to configure

127
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,120
paths I can go to

128
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,039
servers scan for

129
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,199
new find our agent register that agent

130
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,879
locally and that will take a little

131
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,199
while to to do the communication

132
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:04,000
properly um it'll figure out is online

133
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:06,319
in in a in a few

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,520
minutes and there we go we've installed

135
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,039
and configured um release management

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,039
server release management client and an

137
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,039
agent um in our release management

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
environment
