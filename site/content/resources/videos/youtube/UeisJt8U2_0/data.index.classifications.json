However, the focus is occasionally on incompetence or qualification at an individual or process level rather than systemic culture per se. The tone is strongly critical, bordering on satirical at points, meriting a moderate penalty in mentions and intent, as it risks undermining the constructive engagement expected in culture change discourse.

There is only indirect alignment; 'relentless focus on delivering value' is mentioned but not tied to customer outcomes. The absence of frameworks, metrics, or examples involving customer feedback or measurable impact on real users signals misalignment. Penalties for outdated practice references are not warranted, but the key dimensions (alignment/depth) are penalized for insufficient coverage of customer focus as outlined by the strict definition.",

Main attention is on incompetence, certification, mindset, and values—tangential to workflow definition.
