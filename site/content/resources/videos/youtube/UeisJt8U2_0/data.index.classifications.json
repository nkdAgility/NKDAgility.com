However, the focus is occasionally on incompetence or qualification at an individual or process level rather than systemic culture per se. The tone is strongly critical, bordering on satirical at points, meriting a moderate penalty in mentions and intent, as it risks undermining the constructive engagement expected in culture change discourse.
