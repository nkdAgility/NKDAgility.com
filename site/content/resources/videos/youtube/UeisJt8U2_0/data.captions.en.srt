1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,360
so one of the harbingers of the agile

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,240
pocalypse is plague and what plague am I

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,600
referring to uh the plague of

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,119
incompetent agil coaches and scrum

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
Masters and yes I'm using that word very

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,720
specifically I'm talking about those

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,119
folks that have no clue or understanding

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,719
about the work being done and yet seem

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,239
to be elevated to a position where they

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,760
are responsible for the effectiveness of

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,399
the people doing that work and they

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,520
often especially in large organizations

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,320
that have a lot of hierarch

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,480
hierarchy um have more Powers than you

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,879
would ideally like an agile coach or

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,920
scrum Master to have and they wreak

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,039
havoc and Devastation in your organiz

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,159
organization by leveraging those Powers

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:10,200
um this uh looks uh very much like

20
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,000
what's a good example I worked with an

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,320
organization in um in Seattle I think

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
they might have been actually in

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,960
Portland it was just that part of the

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,200
world I was in and um this organization

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,479
they had just fired their scrum

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,560
Master why had they fired their scrum

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,759
Master well their scrum Master had

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,399
decided that if you're not standing up

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,920
you're not doing scrum even though

30
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,479
standing up has nothing to do with scrum

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,439
but if you're not standing up uh uh

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,719
you're not doing scrum and

33
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:51,040
um the team had decided that they would

34
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,680
sit during the daily

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
scrum because they had a team member who

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,240
was disabled and in a wheelchair and

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,840
they didn't want to Tower over that

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,200
person during the event which of those

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,159
two options is the very epitome of scrum

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,000
and agile in that mindset it's the team

41
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,400
that self organized to pay

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,599
respect to their teammate and had the

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,560
courage to to to talk about it and

44
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,239
decide on a way of doing something that

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,879
is the epitome of scrum and the scrum

46
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,599
values this scrum Master total charlatan

47
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,360
didn't have a clue what's really going

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,280
on on focused on mechanical scrum and

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,360
practices and I'm seeing right now this

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,319
is quite topical cuz I am seeing a ton

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,720
of posts about here's why agile's [Â __Â ]

52
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,560
right what was the what was the one

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,159
today agile is a cancer or scrum is a

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,800
cancer I think it was scrum is a Cancer

55
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,920
and he goes on to talk about why why is

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,680
Scrum a cancer although you know that

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,840
terminology has its own weight right but

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,640
it was because because it gives an

59
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,640
excuse for leaders to tell teams what to

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,879
do it gives uh uh uh you have to stand

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,879
up during the daily scrum you have to

62
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,560
too many meetings right too many

63
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,319
meetings um what were the other things

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,519
man there was a whole host of those

65
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,319
things uh today that the and there's

66
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,080
been a number of posts that seems to go

67
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:30,159
in waves right um so this this plague

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:33,400
that affects scrum and agile in general

69
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,000
is this mis Mis not even

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,519
misunderstandings they're just abject

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,239
failures of competence abject failures

72
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,159
of competence these are people that have

73
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,400
maybe never read the scrum guide never

74
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
kept up to date never actually read the

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,840
agel manifesto don't actually understand

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,599
what are the underlying principles that

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,040
we're talking about here and they just

78
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,239
make decisions and do stuff based off

79
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,159
nothing um and then then you have the

80
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,959
impact right what's the impact on the

81
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,280
organization what's the impact on the

82
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,760
teams you can see these posts from

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,200
people that abjectly hate scrum or hate

84
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,600
agile or just think that agile just

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,639
doesn't work right and mostly when you

86
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,160
ask them what are the things that you've

87
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,639
seen that is the reason why agile

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,840
doesn't work or scrum doesn't work or

89
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,280
many of these things they describe

90
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,080
scenarios

91
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,560
that are the very opposite of agility

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,560
right agile doesn't work because we all

93
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
have to do story points and guarantee

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,919
the number of stories delivered per

95
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,600
Sprint these are things that are part of

96
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:53,000
this plague this this it's just a oh you

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,000
can see that I'm quite annoyed by this

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,840
one it it it annoys me every day and I

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,280
meet scrub I meet such awesome and

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,400
amazing scrum Masters and agile coaches

101
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,680
every day who really understand what

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,880
they're doing they're lean agile

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,960
practitioners and they have a complete

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,600
complete deep technical understanding of

105
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,280
the processes practices and tools that

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,120
are needed for the teams that they

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,680
engage in coach with for them to be as

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,440
effective as possible at the job that

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,840
they're doing but unfortunately for

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,440
every one of those awesome uh coaches

111
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,960
there are 10 people who decided

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,000
yesterday to become a scrum Master after

113
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,639
their um I'm being bit sarcastic their

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,199
arts degree right um and they they they

115
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,840
have no clue they want to change their

116
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,600
career and become a scrum master and

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,199
they have no clue about the work that

118
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,759
the team does they have really no clue

119
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,039
and certainly no experience about how to

120
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:56,319
engage with those teams and because

121
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,720
there is a

122
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,319
shortage this is a big rant because

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:06,440
there's a short AG of

124
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,680
um of qualified people in the industry

125
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,520
most organizations they need scrum

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,639
Masters only two good ones apply but

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,479
they need five so they hire three crap

128
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,919
ones because that's who's

129
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,599
available we can do better organizations

130
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,759
need to stop

131
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:28,560
hiring for just their need they need to

132
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,560
hire for the quality of the people that

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,800
they get as well

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
this is a good example of technical debt

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,360
in organizations and it's a great

136
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,000
example of a plague affecting our entire

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
industry and

138
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,400
