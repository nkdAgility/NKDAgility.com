# How would you help organizations pitch the opportunity of agile internally?

#agile has a great track record in organizations where teams have been invited to explore the opportunity of an #agileframework and how it can solve their most compelling problems, but tends to fall over in environments where it is imposed on teams.

It requires #leadership teams to actively champion the #agile adoption, and work closely with #productdevelopment teams to experiment, inspect, and adapt as they move toward a process of continuous improvement in short, sharp bursts known as #sprints.

So, if you're a senior manager or agile advocate within the organization, how would you pitch the opportunity of #agile to your organization? How would you invite others to explore the opportunity and decide whether it is an option worth adopting?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how he would approach the pitch for #agile, and what variables might influence how you should encourage others to explore in more detail.
