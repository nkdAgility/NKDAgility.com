1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,180
foreign

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,719
how

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,839
how do I help organizations pitch the

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,640
idea of agile internally

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,800
I guess it depends whether you're

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,840
managing up or you're managing down

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,600
right

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,080
um so if you're if you're managing up

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,640
I.E you're working on a team or with a

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,540
team or at some level where you're

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,739
building products and you want to do

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,500
Agile but your organization is not yet

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,200
there yet is not yet understanding what

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,420
the difference is or what the impact is

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,879
um then having conversations with them

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,399
in their language is the most important

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,660
thing you can do

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
um you need to

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,579
like there's no point in talking about

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,280
agile or scrum up the organization

21
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,739
because they're words that then you then

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,200
have to explain right the other person's

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,780
like well what the heck is this crap

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,400
right I need to you need to tell me what

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,500
it is then and you end up having to stop

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,619
all the time so you need to use their

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,720
language so if you're talking to people

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,220
with uh

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,500
um like a business value Focus

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,720
then talk about

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,119
um delivering more of the right things

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,640
less of the wrong things

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,520
um talk about uh responding to the

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,619
market more quickly

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,360
I'll talk about

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,439
um

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,439
how to

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,280
um deliver

39
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,140
happier more engaged customers right

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,759
that's that's that's probably what

41
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,560
they're they're focused on that's

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,960
probably what their their metrics push

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,060
but find out what their metrics are

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,180
right what are they measuring as success

45
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,340
in the business and go look at that

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,100
if you're

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,439
um business if you look at those metrics

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,440
and your business is a totally fiscally

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,560
focused right apart from just being

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,099
screwed right you you you also need you

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,260
you you need to look at

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,379
um what are the benefits from a fiscal

53
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,959
perspective that you can get from agile

54
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,060
I I feel like if your company's focused

55
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,220
on just fiscal stuff then that's not a

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,020
good thing anyway right that's Revenue

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,220
extraction rather than value creation

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,620
but

59
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,300
um that's that's you can only get to

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,940
that conversation once you convince them

61
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,660
so you want to be talking about reducing

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,180
fiscal risk you want to be talking about

63
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,879
because quick fast iterations of of of

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,360
actual value they provide reduces

65
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,000
operational risk reduces fiscal risk

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
um it it

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,200
increases the value that you've

68
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,900
delivered and in most countries there

69
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,420
are tax benefits to to write down

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,420
Capital expenditures right for example

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,760
it's here's a simple argument

72
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm going to spend uh uh 12 million

73
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,360
dollars capital expenditure to to build

74
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,019
a product

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,720
um

76
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,319
at the end of 12 months I'm going to

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,180
deliver that product into production

78
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,040
and at that point and like I can start

79
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,019
writing down that capital expenditure

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,760
right from a tax perspective normally

81
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,980
you can only start writing down so it

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,200
depreciates over time right you can

83
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,519
write that down and claim tax benefits

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,519
for it most countries I don't know about

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,239
all countries but UK US definitely have

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,519
have have these things in there

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,299
but if you remember in school when you

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,879
do that uh um compound interest

89
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,040
calculation right and you're always look

90
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,599
how big the money grows the the opposite

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,220
is true for

92
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,860
um writing things down

93
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,799
so at the end of if you're if you're

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,360
delivering monthly right to production

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,580
it's costing you a million dollars a

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,500
month on a 12 million dollar yearly gig

97
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,360
at the end of the first month you can

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,680
just you can start writing down that

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,480
million dollars

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,099
and then at the end of the second month

101
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,360
you've already had a month of writing

102
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,280
down a million dollars and you start

103
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,840
writing down the second million dollars

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,459
and then at the end of the third month

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,500
you've had two months of writing down

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,639
the first million dollars two sorry

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
three months of writing down the first

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,660
million dollars two months of the second

109
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,180
and you're getting into the the third

110
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,120
right so you end up with this compound

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,460
right I've never met a CFO

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,699
um who you can't convince that agile's a

113
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,340
good idea if you use their language what

114
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,400
data are they looking at how could being

115
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,040
more agile shift those metrics and use

116
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,840
their words to describe it so that's

117
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,820
that's managing up

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,800
um if you're in leadership in your

119
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,240
organization and you're looking down in

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,639
your organization and you're trying to

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,259
figure out how do I

122
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,780
um engage all of these people in this

123
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,699
change activity in moving towards a

124
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,820
different way of working

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,780
um and the answer is get them involved

126
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,759
in that process you need to create an

127
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,639
event

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,919
whereby you're asking them

129
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,580
what it is that we need to do

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,040
differently getting them to agree what

131
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,759
the action steps are to move forward

132
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,199
getting them to choose the processes and

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
practices that you're going to use

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,240
because only by them choosing it them

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,479
being involved and them deciding

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,180
will they care enough about the change

137
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,220
to get behind it and support it and help

138
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,680
help help

139
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,600
make that change otherwise they'll

140
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,280
they'll they're not in they don't care

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,900
about your objectives right they care

142
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,820
about their objectives you have to make

143
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,979
it their objective or help encourage it

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,880
to be their objective so I use things

145
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,199
like um open space agile and there's a

146
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,080
concrete implementation called open

147
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,699
space beta which helps helps with that

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,979
as well

149
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,780
um so yeah it just depends whether

150
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,780
you're managing up and rising down
