1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,840
in our new class we will learn how to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,440
work with

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,519
assumptions so first very important

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,240
point we actually introduce assumption

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,439
to our product development

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:28,199
dictionary so one of the very important

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,720
points we will learn is this moment of

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,520
realization oh we we have made

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,480
assumptions and not one not two but many

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,360
so what kind of assumptions are we

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,399
making When developing products when

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,879
discussing potential product Futures

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:52,600
when creating product backlog items so

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,000
this is a very important aspect but we

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,559
are not only talking about this fact

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,479
okay the assumptions were made but

17
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,040
which of them need to be

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:12,159
validated obviously not every assumption

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,600
require validation some of them are more

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,040
important less important there might be

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,920
a crucial role in

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:26,560
ordering our assumptions so which should

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:31,000
be validated first and why we are going

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,680
to cover cover that in that course

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,560
okay so first point assumptions

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,439
realization ordering and choosing which

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,280
one to start second one when we work

28
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,880
with

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,280
assumptions the next important topic is

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,799
about

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,119
hypothesis so we will learn how to

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,680
create

33
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,960
hypothesis and how to test

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:05,039
it so in this class we will pay a lot

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:09,039
lot of attention to using right data

36
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:12,440
that will help you verify your

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,200
hypothesis in fact we may realize that

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,560
our product

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:21,720
development is actually navigating

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,319
around some kind of tree of different uh

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:30,400
different hypothesis to test we will

42
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:34,680
also discuss uh the topic of um import

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,319
importance of desired signal or evidence

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,400
strength on our product development

45
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,360
process so when we test assumptions when

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,640
we talk about hypothesis driven

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:53,000
development it's important to realize

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,680
that there will be never 100% confidence

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,920
but what is your desired level of

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,560
confidence and based on that how high

51
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,879
you want to be when it comes to

52
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,200
confidence uh we will be talking about

53
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:15,920
experiments that will help us test test

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:20,159
the hypothesis so we will learn how to

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,840
manage cost related to product

56
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,760
development based on those experiments

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,599
that we

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,080
choose and this will be aligned with

59
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,239
desired uh um signal strength with

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,239
desired confidence

61
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:45,760
level another um another valuable

62
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:48,319
outcome for us is learn how to analyze

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,400
experiments how to

64
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,319
take what we got out of our

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:00,920
experimentation journey and how to use

66
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:04,760
this data in decision making proc

67
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:09,360
process so we already talked that

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:14,360
learning is important in this class so

69
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,239
think about it as a way of targeted

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,359
learnings that will help in this

71
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,160
decision making and critical thinking

72
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:28,880
thanks to that we want to

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:33,280
avoid toxic love related to our ideas

74
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,880
and to what customer customers told us

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,280
instead we will be equipped with certain

76
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,240
way of thinking maybe for some of us it

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,199
will be a new perspective on product

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,479
development and thanks to that

79
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:55,600
perspective we will be learning a lot

80
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:59,720
what to do what not to do how to use

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,400
those concept to to be effective in know

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,400
our product development
