short_title: Mastering Assumptions in Product Development
description: Learn how to identify, prioritise, and test assumptions in product development using hypothesis-driven methods, experimentation, and critical analysis for better decision-making.
tldr: Success in product development depends on identifying, prioritising, and validating assumptions through structured hypotheses and targeted experiments. Focusing on the most critical assumptions, using data-driven testing, and avoiding attachment to unproven ideas leads to better decision-making and outcomes. Development managers should foster a culture of learning and adaptability by encouraging teams to challenge assumptions and iterate based on evidence.

In our ever-evolving landscape of [product development]({{< ref "/categories/product-development" >}}), one of the most crucial skills we can cultivate is the ability to work with assumptions. It’s a topic that I’m particularly passionate about, and I’m excited to share insights from our new class focused on this very subject.

### Understanding Assumptions in Product Development

First and foremost, we need to acknowledge that assumptions are an inherent part of our product development journey. It’s not just a single assumption we make; often, it’s a multitude of them. Recognising this is the first step towards more effective [product management]({{< ref "/categories/product-management" >}}).

- **What assumptions are we making?**
  - When discussing potential product futures
  - While creating [product backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) items
  - Throughout the entire development process

Understanding the types of assumptions we make is vital, but it’s equally important to determine which of these need validation. Not every assumption carries the same weight; some are critical, while others may be less significant.

### Prioritising Assumptions for Validation

In our class, we’ll delve into how to order these assumptions and decide which ones to validate first. This prioritisation is key to ensuring that our efforts are focused on the most impactful areas.

- **Key points to consider:**
  - The significance of each assumption
  - The potential impact of validating or invalidating them
  - The resources available for testing

### The Role of Hypotheses

Once we’ve identified our assumptions, the next step is to formulate hypotheses. This is where the real magic happens. We’ll explore how to create robust hypotheses and the methodologies for testing them effectively.

- **What we’ll cover:**
  - Crafting hypotheses based on our assumptions
  - The importance of using the right data for verification
  - Navigating through a “tree” of hypotheses to test

It’s essential to understand that in product development, we will never achieve 100% confidence in our hypotheses. Instead, we need to define our desired level of confidence and align our testing strategies accordingly.

### [Experimentation]({{< ref "/tags/experimentation" >}}) and Analysis

A significant part of our learning will focus on designing experiments that help us test our hypotheses. We’ll discuss how to manage costs related to these experiments and ensure they align with our desired signal strength and confidence levels.

- **Outcomes of our experimentation:**
  - Analysing results to inform decision-making
  - Learning from our experiments to refine our approach
  - Developing critical thinking skills that enhance our product development process

### Avoiding Toxic Love for Ideas

One of the most valuable lessons I hope to impart is the importance of avoiding what I call “toxic love” for our ideas. It’s easy to become attached to our concepts based on customer feedback or our own biases. However, by adopting a more analytical mindset, we can make more informed decisions that lead to successful product outcomes.

- **What to expect:**
  - A new perspective on product development
  - Strategies for effective decision-making
  - Insights into what to do, and what not to do

In conclusion, this class is designed to equip you with the tools and mindset necessary for navigating the complexities of product development. By focusing on assumptions, hypotheses, and experimentation, we can foster a culture of learning and adaptability that ultimately leads to better products and satisfied customers. I look forward to embarking on this journey with you and exploring the exciting world of hypothesis-driven development together.
