Transitioning from a developer to a Scrum developer is pretty, pretty, pretty difficult. We have to get better at continuous everything, right? Continuous delivery, continuous testing, continuous release. 

Um, and that takes engineering practices, which takes practice, right? So, um, developers need to practice extensively their craft in order to be able to create products that are able to support the ideas behind Agile. The ideas of being able to continuously deliver our products, continuously release our products, and maintain high quality in our products. 

Um, and that just takes time and effort.
