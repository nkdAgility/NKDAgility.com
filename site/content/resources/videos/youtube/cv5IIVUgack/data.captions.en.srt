1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,339
transitioning from a developer to a

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,820
scrum developer is is pretty pretty

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,099
pretty difficult we have to get better

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
at continuous everything right

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,880
continuous delivery continuous testing

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,660
continuous release

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,480
um and that takes engineering practices

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,539
which takes practice right so

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,359
um developers need to practice

10
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:30,920
extensively their craft in order to be

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,500
able to create products

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,820
that are able to support the ideas

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,260
behind agile the ideas of being able to

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,480
continuously deliver our products

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,440
continuously release our products and

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,539
maintain high quality in our products

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,539
um and that just takes time and effort
