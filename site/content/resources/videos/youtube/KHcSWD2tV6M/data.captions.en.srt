one of the seven signs of the agile

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:10,040
apocalypse is silence silence manifests

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,240
in many ways uh but it often manifests

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,320
as people not willing to speak up when

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,960
they see something wrong they're not

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,119
willing to speak up when they see uh uh

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,000
teams or people doing things that aren't

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,800
part of what we're trying to do they

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,240
don't speak up when uh decisions are

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,040
made that negatively impact the Val

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,000
delivery to the customer they don't

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,440
speak up when we lie to the customer by

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,399
saying that we can do something before

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,399
we've done it these are all things that

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,600
manifest as silence and silence is one

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,039
