One of the seven signs of the Agile apocalypse is silence. Silence manifests in many ways, but it often manifests as people not willing to speak up when they see something wrong. They're not willing to speak up when they see teams or people doing things that aren't part of what we're trying to do. They don't speak up when decisions are made that negatively impact the value delivery to the customer. They don't speak up when we lie to the customer by saying that we can do something before we've done it. These are all things that manifest as silence, and silence is one of the seven signs of the Agile apocalypse.
