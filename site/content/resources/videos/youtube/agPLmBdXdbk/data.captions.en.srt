1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,000
so what is a must-have trait and an

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,179
agile consultant I I think it's tenacity

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,559
you have to be able to

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,980
um focus on and not give up on the

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,779
things that really matter uh for the

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,939
organization that you're working with so

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,699
once you've figured out and what are

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,920
some of the things uh that that need to

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,260
change you've you've validated some of

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,460
your assumptions right to to to have

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,859
that Focus

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,100
you need to be able to have that laser

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,140
focus go for it and not be dissuaded by

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,140
all of the naysayers in the organization
