**Must have trait in an Agile Consultant**

What's the one must have trait that an Agile Consultant absolutely needs? Whilst there are many important traits that are important, I’d say it has to be tenacity! 💪

The ability to zero in on what truly matters to the organization you're serving and to persistently pursue it is crucial to the success of your coaching.

A major part of that tenacity kicks in once you've pinpointed the areas that require change and cross-verified your assumptions, it's then time to strap in and sprint forward with laser focus. 🎯

And when, not if, the naysayers within the organization begin to put forward potential problems or hurdles, remember to don your armor of tenacity and continue to forge ahead.

It's about moving forward undeterred with focus, no matter what obstacles may arise or what the doubters may say! 🏃‍♂️
