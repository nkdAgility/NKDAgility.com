So what is a must-have trait in an agile consultant? I think it's tenacity. You have to be able to focus on and not give up on the things that really matter for the organization that you're working with. So once you've figured out what are some of the things that need to change, you've validated some of your assumptions, right? To have that focus, you need to be able to have that laser focus, go for it, and not be dissuaded by all of the naysayers in the organization.
