1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,920
I always find it

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,160
interesting when in a in a in a in a

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,759
recession or potential recession or

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,080
Market instability right whatever

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,680
whatever your story is in in your

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,880
country um we T we we we we talk about

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,760
this this idea of of cost cutting and

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
organizations divest themselves of of of

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,720
of things they believe is waste um like

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
we've seen uh Capital One uh get rid of

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,680
a lot of uh agile coaches and scrum

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,000
Masters and even though they didn't

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,079
really because they're still hiring

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,719
agile coaches and scrum Masters lots of

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,920
other organizations have kind of done a

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,600
lot of those those cost cutting measures

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,239
and actually they're shooting themselves

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,879
in the foot they're absolutely shooting

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,719
themselves in the food they're they're

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,640
disadvantaging themselves in the face of

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,160
other organizations that don't do that

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,399
that do it differently um probably the

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,960
best analogy I I I

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,960
remember I have done a little bit of of

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,520
marketing in the in the distant past or

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,439
remember from from University at least

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,479
that

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,840
um the best

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:25,200
time to invest in marketing is when

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,439
sales are down and the econom is not so

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
great

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,680
because the benefits that you reach on

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,520
the other end are the payday right you

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,119
have to put in the investment put in the

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,799
time when everything's boom and

36
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,399
everything's going on you don't need a

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
lot of marketing to do the business that

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
you want to

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,880
do when everything

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,920
sucks you need to do more to get what's

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,439
there right because everything sucks and

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,280
there's not none enough to go around so

43
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,880
those that invest in sales and Market

44
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,680
during a recession are the ones that are

45
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,560
more likely to be successful coming at

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
the other end and the same is true for

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,200
agile for agile and uh uh let's call it

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,640
business agility rather than the big a

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,959
word whatever we want to call it um I

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,519
want businesses to be able

51
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,480
to effectively take advantage of Market

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,120
opportunities when they arise right um

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,800
all businesses exist in uh volatile

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,000
Market there's very few there used to be

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,200
nonvolatile markets today there's very

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,599
few nonvolatile markets maybe diamonds I

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,319
don't know that's maybe a non-volatile

58
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,920
market I don't know much about it but it

59
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,519
feels nonvolatile but all of the markets

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,080
that we're all going to exist exist in

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,120
if you're building software and products

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,200
I have a good example in oil um oil and

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:01,200
gas that if you're in that volatile

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,519
Market when things start to

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,799
suck that's the time you should be

66
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,720
investing in your efficiency your

67
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,879
productivity and your

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,360
Effectiveness right those are the times

69
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,040
when you should be investing in those

70
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,400
things

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,280
because part of it is you get a little

72
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
bit of breathing room right because if

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,120
there's not a lot going on in in in the

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,200
market like the market starting to

75
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,000
stagnate a little bit then you've not

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,400
got that clamoring for for for for new

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,280
features and it gives you time to get

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,480
your house in order to re reorganize

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,920
re-evaluate weee what's going on um but

80
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,120
we tend to focus purely on the numbers

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,120
right because a lots of organizations

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,519
have shareholders and shareholders want

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,200
their cash um so we can either not pay

84
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,720
the

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,959
shareholders um this quarter and

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,079
reinvest in our company and our people

87
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,840
in our organization or we can fire 500

88
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,239
people and give the shareholders this a

89
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
higher yield than they were expecting

90
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,959
right and lots of organizations opt for

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,799
that second one and that is shoting

92
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,560
yourself in the fut that is h a um

93
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,160
Revenue

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,280
extraction over value creation we want

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,800
to be focusing on value creation because

96
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,039
long-term value creation is what Builds

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,840
an effective business it's how your

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,720
business was built in the first place so

99
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,400
we want to be focusing during a

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,840
recession um on Effectiveness

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,840
productivity and uh uh all those lovely

102
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,800
goodies

103
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:54,120
so in the boom

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,720
times we um tried all the things right

105
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,759
anything that came along oh we've got

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,840
cash for it let's do that oh we've got

107
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
cash for this let's do that right

108
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,520
because we've got a lot of cash we're

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,840
we're

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,360
affluent when we start moving into um

111
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,039
the opposite of Boom bust I guess when

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,280
that bubble pops um or deflates right it

113
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,880
could just be deflating a little bit

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,440
then we need to focus on our own

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,479
Effectiveness if we can become more

116
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,639
effective we can do more with what we've

117
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:31,120
got and that means that we'll be the

118
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:34,280
ones in the market

119
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,680
innovating and adapting to the changing

120
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,840
Market more effectively does that make

121
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,880
sense like if if we start

122
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,919
um oh if we start if we start firing

123
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,080
lots of people we're going to have an

124
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,039
unhappy

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,400
Workforce because people are unhappy

126
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,680
when their friends get fired and or

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,160
other people in the company because they

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,280
get scared and then there's fear and

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,280
they don't want to do stuff and they're

130
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,600
like holy crap what's going on so

131
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:06,360
unhappy afraid people don't do good

132
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,800
work so by having those layoffs within

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,680
your

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,039
organization you've created a Culture of

135
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,319
Fear maybe unwittingly and maybe some of

136
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,960
it's necessary right but you've created

137
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,560
that Culture of Fear and the people that

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,199
are in there are not going to be serving

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,400
the customers needs as well because

140
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,240
they're

141
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,440
fearful

142
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,520
so then customers are more un happy with

143
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,639
what it is that you're doing and you get

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,840
that vicious cycle and lots of

145
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,240
organizations end up in a death spiral

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,840
at that point um and you just know

147
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,560
they're going to going to disappear it

148
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,280
can be quite difficult to recover from

149
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,479
from from some of those

150
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,039
things so what what we do when the

151
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,319
bubble starts deflating is we start

152
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,759
focusing on our Effectiveness how do we

153
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:59,840
ensure that we're able

154
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,960
to maximize the amount we're able to

155
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,000
deliver if you think of this this is my

156
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,759
market line right and above the line is

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,080
the market and then the people that are

158
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,879
doing the work are here and all the way

159
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,400
down here is the CEO who's not really

160
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,520
connecting with the market right the

161
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,160
market the people in your organization

162
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,479
are connected directly to the market

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,199
they're the ones that we want to have as

164
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,840
effective as possible and dynamically

165
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,919
shifting to whatever Market

166
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,160
opportunities come up because the more

167
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,960
opportunities we're able to take

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,240
advantage of within that market space

169
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,360
even in a recession the less impact it's

170
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,280
going to have in our overall business

171
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,800
especially if we're doing lots of small

172
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,599
experiments which can be risky but also

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,800
we get you know without risk without

174
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,680
risk you don't get the bonus right um

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,159
and we're able to adapt to those those

176
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,680
changing needs as much as possible as

177
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,919
quickly as possible then we as a

178
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
business are more likely to survive

179
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,759
we're just more likely to survive if

180
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,840
we're able to adapt to those changing

181
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,080
Market needs um and I I want to quote um

182
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,360
Sati and Adela here I have a little H

183
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:06,240
quote up here um there cannot be a more

184
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,960
important thing for an engineer for a

185
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,400
product team than to work on the systems

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,159
that drive our

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,280
productivity so I would any day of the

188
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:19,520
week trade off features for our own

189
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,680
productivity I want our best Engineers

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,280
to work on our Engineering Systems so

191
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,000
that later on we can come back and build

192
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,400
all of the new Concepts we

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,719
want that is the epitome of this idea

194
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,440
right although from an engineering

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,680
perspective because Sati has a

196
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,880
engineering background

197
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,200
right if we as a

198
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,240
business have Slicker more effective

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,519
processes minimized processes right you

200
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,800
you want to have you want to have

201
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,880
systems on your business that is based

202
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,880
on principles not rules if you have

203
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,800
rules everybody will follow them and

204
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,680
they don't need to to think if they

205
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,040
don't need to think when a market

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,839
opportunity comes along they follow the

207
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,440
rule not the market right because

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,800
they're not thinking they need to follow

209
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,320
the rule but if we have a system based

210
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,680
on

211
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,680
principles then the people within it

212
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,600
need to think and within the bounds of

213
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,440
those principles they take advantage of

214
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,640
Market opportunities as they arise or

215
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,000
other opportunities or different way

216
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
different ways of doing things in order

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,040
to be

218
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,760
successful so this idea

219
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,760
of of boom and bust of non- recession

220
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,040
and

221
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:42,760
recession um is when things are going

222
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,959
badly the thing you want to be investing

223
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,920
in is your your people and your

224
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,440
organization and your uh practices and

225
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,959
processes and making things more

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,880
effective more effective is really

227
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,240
important a lot of people in business

228
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,279
talk about productivity um and

229
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,839
productivity is important but I think

230
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:04,959
effectiveness is that nuanced version of

231
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,399
the word productivity that is because

232
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,600
because we could be highly productive I

233
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,120
we're delivering lots of stuff but are

234
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
we delivering the right stuff right I

235
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,600
know that this is basically me

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,959
nitpicking the word right but

237
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
Effectiveness is includes are we

238
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:25,040
building enough of the right stuff and

239
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,240
these are the types of things that um we

240
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,079
need to we need to invest in and that

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,680
that doesn't mean that that you've to go

242
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,360
and invest hundreds of thousands in

243
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,320
scrum training or cand training or uh

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,560
coaches or scrum Masters or any of those

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,600
things you want to figure out for your

246
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,839
business in your market right because

247
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,560
remember you were in that volatile

248
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,120
Market what help and

249
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,560
support do the people that are

250
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,160
interacting with the market need in

251
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,839
order to become more effective

252
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,320
now sometimes that is going to be

253
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,680
training right do they understand the

254
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,360
theory and principles behind this we

255
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,600
think this might help those teams let's

256
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,920
train them in this we're not going to

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,519
make them do that right we're not going

258
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,160
to for example let's take scrum as an

259
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,839
example we're not going to make them do

260
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,600
scrum we want the people that are doing

261
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,600
the work that are engaging with the

262
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,639
volatile markets to choose to be able to

263
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,279
choose the best approach based on the

264
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,639
principles that we base our organization

265
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,160
on so in order for them to choose the

266
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,000
best approach best within the context

267
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,560
right most effective within the

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,399
context they need to have the Knowledge

269
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,760
and Skills and understanding necessary

270
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,279
to be able to make those decisions so

271
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,440
this is where actually you you also

272
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,760
don't go and hire one of the big

273
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,200
Consulting companies to come in and do

274
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,200
it for you right so you could hire a a a

275
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
Boston Consulting Group or uh McKenzie

276
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,959
to come in and say this is how you're

277
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
going to do

278
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,760
everything but the people in the system

279
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
didn't learn

280
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,519
anything the way humans learn is by

281
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,360
doing we learn more by doing than by

282
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,760
just talking about it so in order to

283
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,720
learn what works and what doesn't and

284
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,639
how much it works and how much it

285
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,279
doesn't we need to actually do and try

286
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,160
the things so you need the people within

287
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,600
your system right that's the people that

288
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,680
work for you in your company this is

289
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,519
your people they need to be the ones

290
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,240
that do the work they need to be the

291
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,800
ones that learn that become the

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,079
practitioners that understand those H um

293
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,079
uh processes practices tools uh uh

294
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,560
principles theories right so the theory

295
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,279
of constraints you be talking about

296
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,279
scrum Theory you might be talking about

297
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,560
first principles for all of these things

298
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:00,199
they need to be the ones that understand

299
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,959
it so that they're able within any

300
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,839
context to make the best decision

301
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,279
possible Right to make the best choices

302
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,240
possible within the the the the system

303
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,639
of principles that we build around our

304
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,240
our our organizational structure and

305
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,800
that that means that you're probably

306
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,519
going to be doing a lot of uh training

307
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,839
you're probably going to be bringing in

308
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,880
experts on specific topics to help

309
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,760
engage with with people inside the

310
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,360
organization but generally you you

311
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,560
probably don't want to be doing that

312
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,360
wholesale right because what's right for

313
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,480
one part of the organization might not

314
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,240
be right for another part of the

315
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,680
organization so what I I think is an

316
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,480
effective way is let the people that are

317
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,519
doing the work decide who and what they

318
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,360
need so I work with a a company in

319
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,560
Spain um the the there kind of two

320
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,360
sister companies that it's kind of same

321
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,519
but different but y um and they give

322
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,440
every single one of their employees a

323
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,440
budget for for for training and

324
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,880
Consulting right so every employee I

325
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,639
can't remember how much it was let's say

326
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,320
it's

327
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,519
â¬5,000 every employee has â¬5,000 so if

328
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,759
you've got a team of five

329
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:24,560
people um that's â¬225,000

330
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:26,120
to spend on training and Consulting it's

331
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,720
their budget they can spend it how they

332
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,279
like they can get together and bring in

333
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,959
some kind of Coach they can get together

334
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,360
and and bring in maybe they they want a

335
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,560
scrum Master for a little while um or

336
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,600
somebody specific right like you want

337
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,000
somebody who who who focuses on a

338
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,839
particular thing like there folks out

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,560
there that focus on Sprint goals and

340
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,920
goals and value and that and there's

341
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,680
people out there focusing engineering

342
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,079
practices and devops right so you could

343
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,759
bring in an expert for for a period of

344
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,440
time to participate with the with the

345
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,480
team and it comes out of their budget

346
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,320
they're the ones making the decision and

347
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,199
that means that because they're making

348
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,399
the

349
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,680
decision they care about what that

350
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,639
person they've chosen to bring in have

351
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,240
to say this is this is the whole whole

352
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,240
thing of other people don't care about

353
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,480
your

354
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,279
goals right they care about their goals

355
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,759
so the way you enable more effective

356
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,519
organizations is the either you make

357
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,040
their goals your goals or they make your

358
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,519
goals their goals right so we all have

359
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,759
to be going in the same direction what

360
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,720
is it we're trying to do and princip

361
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,480
and goals strategic goals intermediate

362
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,680
strategic goals those are the things

363
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,199
that help us move together in the same

364
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,000
direction as a as a distinct company and

365
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:46,360
when we put all of that together um

366
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,680
we're then able to be more effective

367
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,519
we're able to deliver more value we're

368
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:56,040
able to adapt as needed to the changing

369
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,199
circumstances right so as a as a team or

370
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,639
group inside of your organization

371
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,600
decides they need some help with

372
