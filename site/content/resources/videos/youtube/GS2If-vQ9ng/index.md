## Why Both Are Hard-Hitting but in Different Ways

Have you ever thought about how Agile Training and Agile Consulting each deliver impactful results but target distinct aspects of organisational improvement?Â  ðŸ¤”

## Agile Training: Hard-Hitting Knowledge Dissemination

Agile training plays a vital role when it comes to getting the knowledge needed for the business. Â It's especially effective when you're training within the company in Agile practice.Â  ðŸ“š

This ensures that no one can say they didn't understand what they were trained on, creating a common vocabulary and baseline understanding for everyone involved.

## Agile Consulting: Targeted, Time-Limited, and Hard-Hitting

While Agile training is about broad-scale knowledge sharing, Agile consulting is also generally hard-hitting, right?

The time-limited nature of consulting allows for a laser-focused approach, targeting specific issues that the consultant identifies that are not going well or opportunities for improvement within the business.Â  ðŸŽ¯

## The Core Difference Between Agile Training and Consulting

So, in summary, this is the main difference between Agile training and consulting.Â  Agile training is about broad understanding and skill-building.

In contrast, Agile consulting zeroes in on specific pain points and challenges, offering tailored solutions. Â Both are "hard-hitting" but operate in unique arenas. ðŸŽ¯
