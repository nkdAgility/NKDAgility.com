    "final_score": 11.0,
    "reasoning": "The content does not mention first principles, nor does it discuss any foundational, immutable truths in Agile, Lean, or related domains. Its focus is a comparison between training and consulting services, emphasizing skill-building and targeted business solutions but never referencing or applying irreducible constraints or theorists' original formulations. There is no substantive exploration, identification, or application of first principles. Target audience alignment is moderate as it speaks generally to practitioners, but the content is largely promotional and informative about service offerings, not system foundations or non-negotiable principles as required by the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content compares Agile training and consulting without mentioning or exploring foundational first principles. Its focus is service differentiation, not immutable system constraints, so it falls far outside the category’s scope.",
    "level": "Ignored"
