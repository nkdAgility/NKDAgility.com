1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:06,609
agile training is great for

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,750
um

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:11,929
hard testing you know getting that

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,509
knowledge into the business getting that

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,369
knowledge into a large group of people

6
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,830
um especially if I've done gigs where

7
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,750
you train everybody in the company in in

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,949
the agile Practice season and nobody can

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,689
say they didn't understand what that

10
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,109
thing was right

11
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:29,449
um but agile Consulting is also

12
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,550
generally hard hitting right because

13
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,770
you're you've got a very time limited

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,530
nature of that

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,250
um but it's about targeting specific

16
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:43,370
things that the consultant identifies is

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,829
not going well or opportunities for

18
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,030
improvement within your business so

19
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:50,770
that's the main difference between

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,770
between training and Consulting
