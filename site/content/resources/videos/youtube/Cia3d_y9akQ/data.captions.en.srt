1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,040
there are lots of

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,480
misconceptions about what the

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,599
accountability of the scrum Master is

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:15,599
supposed to entail contain focus on um

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,760
most of this manifests because of the

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,680
difference

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,640
between an organizational role which

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,680
might include many accountabilities

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,519
including scrum Master even if it's

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,599
called scrum master um and uh the the

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,559
actual accountability as as as what

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,960
scrum talks about and what it genuinely

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,120
leads to because there's been so many

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,280
people that have transitioned from

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,480
whatever they did before into scrum

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,360
master so they might have been um

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,239
project managers they might have been

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,160
managers they might have been developers

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,440
right and they transition into the the

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,640
the role and they have limited

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,199
understanding of the the the the the

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,879
core principles and philosophies that

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,720
underpin scrum and underpin agile um

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,960
they end up making some very common um

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,000
mistakes so common that that you you'll

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:19,360
see um one of the most common responses

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,320
when people say uh oh scrums not working

28
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,439
we did this and the most common response

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,360
is that's not scrum and the reason

30
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,640
that's the most common response is

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,439
because the thing that they describe

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,680
rbe is not talked about in the scrum

33
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,439
guide it's not part of scrum it's not

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,000
pro might not even be part of anything

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,399
to do with anything to do with agile um

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,320
and people will say well but in scrum

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,320
you have to great example you have to

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,640
have a user

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,000
story user stories are not a scrum thing

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,759
you have to have a burndown if you don't

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,520
have a burndown you're not doing scrum

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,920
burnd Downs aren't a scrum thing burnd

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,680
Downs come from before or scrum and yes

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,360
they might have been encouraged uh for a

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,920
while but they're they're they're not in

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,959
the scrum guide anymore for sure um user

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
stories were never in the I don't think

48
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,040
they were ever in the scrum guide I

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,599
would need to go look at the history of

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,519
that thing but um I'm pretty sure they

51
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,000
don't planning poker not a scrum thing

52
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,440
user H story points not a scrum thing

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,720
all of these

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,920
things are

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,200
mechanisms that people have chosen to

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,040
use and might be quite common within the

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,159
context of scrum but that doesn't mean

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,440
there's something that you have to do

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:47,080
right if it's not working for you stop

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:50,080
doing it or pick something else right um

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,879
so one of the most common uh

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,519
dysfunctional behaviors that that I see

63
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,840
scrum Masters time after time doing is

64
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,519
focusing on mechanisms and the reason

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,480
this goes back to the confidence story

66
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,120
that we have the reason they're focusing

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,720
on mechanisms is they have no skills and

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,159
abilities and knowledge within the

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,599
context of the philosophy's principles

70
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,720
and theories if you don't understand the

71
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,440
philosophy's principles and theories you

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,920
can't apply them in new and interesting

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,519
ways you're going to look at what other

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,640
people are doing and just copy that so

75
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,799
you end up copying planning poker we're

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
just going to we're going to do planning

77
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,640
poker we're going to do user stories

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
we're gonna have a burndown we're going

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,840
to do those things that everybody else

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,120
is doing because I don't understand why

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,480
they're doing it I don't understand the

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,040
principles philosophies and theories

83
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,920
that underpin the reason this thing

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,720
isn't successful for this particular

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:54,799
team or this particular

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,560
company competence right move away from

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,799
these

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,159
mechanical practices that are a choice

89
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,640
and move

90
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,400
towards understanding the principles

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,239
theories and

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,239
philosophies another great uh most

93
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,799
common um scrum Master thing and is

94
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:20,120
actually the reason that agile coach

95
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,160
exists even though there's no such thing

96
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,280
as an agile coach is people think the

97
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,320
scrum Masters focuses on the

98
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,320
team it's not that's onethird

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,199
of their focus scrum Masters should be

100
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,560
focused on the team the product owner so

101
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,160
the business side and the organizational

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,160
structure and capability all three of

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,600
those things in equal measure are the

104
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,800
accountability of the scrum master so

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,960
focusing on the team means that you're

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,120
you you're perhaps creating suboptimal

107
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,440
improvements within that team that then

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,400
create an overall dysfunction in the

109
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,840
organization because you're you're not

110
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,600
doing you know all of if you're if

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,039
you're working in a team and it's within

112
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,240
the context of an organization and

113
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,280
you're trying to help that team and you

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,960
get them to do something that causes

115
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,600
friction with the rest of the

116
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,759
organization right you probably got a

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
suboptimal change what you should be

118
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,720
doing as a scrum Master instead of

119
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,000
making that change in this team and make

120
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,560
making them unpopular within the

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,080
organization because they're not doing

122
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
the things they need to do is to work on

123
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,600
changing the organization or perhaps

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,319
it's the right thing to do right just

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,319
change it and they see it's being

126
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,600
successful and now we can we can do that

127
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,280
but that's a

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,440
strategy are you using the correct

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,759
or most effective

130
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,639
strategy within the context of your

131
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,759
understanding as a scrum Master of the

132
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,360
theories principles um and philosophies

133
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,280
that you're trying to fulfill right that

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,840
will help you make those choices um

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,280
there's a whole bunch of uh

136
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,919
stanes uh we talk about stanes of the

137
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,680
scrum master um and and for me the

138
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,160
stanes coaching mentoring uh uh teaching

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,479
right these are stanes of the scrum

140
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,960
master and the the ones that we see time

141
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,560
and time again actually I have they're

142
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,960
they're so common they're included in

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,720
the advanced scrum master class because

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,280
they're so common does the scrum

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,800
police right that's not scrum or if

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,080
you're not doing user stories you're not

147
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,759
doing scrum or um oh you you the the

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,120
team shouldn't be talking to the

149
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,680
customer right all this crap um you've

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,000
got the the Scribe of the team so the

151
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,720
scrum Master writing things down for the

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,639
team the scrum

153
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,720
master has no in

154
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,000
general I'm using this for to highlight

155
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,759
a specific content context the scrum

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,759
master has no need to have permission to

157
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,280
J no no no specific need for that I I've

158
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,039
helped loads of teams that use jira and

159
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,319
I've never touched jira I've never been

160
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,560
an admin of jira um those are not part

161
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,360
of the SC Masters role and that brings

162
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,000
us to jira admin right um being the

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,000
chairman of the team being the secretary

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
of the team being a hero on the team all

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,479
of these are very dysfunctional

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,960
behaviors that are the

167
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:52,039
result of a lack of competence within

168
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:55,080
the context of scrum Mastery right um so

169
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:57,560
anytime a scrum Master is making

170
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,800
decisions they're not being a scrum

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,720
Master right any time they're they're um

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,560
hiring and firing although those are

173
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,400
things they might do right it's

174
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,680
absolutely possible for a scrum Master

175
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,639
to also be the manager of a team

176
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,560
therefore they might be accountable in

177
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
the organizational context in addition

178
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,599
to them being a scrum Master for the

179
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,759
team they're also accountable for

180
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:31,440
reports for hiring and firing for

181
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:33,760
decision making right for for for other

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,240
things but that's not the focus of the

183
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
scrum master and if those other things

184
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,560
are

185
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
conflicting

186
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,600
with enabling the effectiveness of the

187
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,839
team then they become something that

188
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
it's expected that scrum Master to try

189
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,399
and

190
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
address

191
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,600
right

192
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,399
so this

193
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,000
this idea of the scrum Master the reason

194
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,200
they moved it

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,079
from talking about it as a role to

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,519
talking about it as

197
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:10,560
accountabilities is because most people

198
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,079
in organizations have multiple sets of

199
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,040
accountabilities right and not all of

200
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:19,440
them are scrum related scrum is not your

201
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,680
whole world when you're a developer when

202
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,560
you're a product

203
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,680
owner when you're when you're a scrum

204
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,160
Master if you're a scrum Master you

205
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,760
might also be a manager you may be a

206
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,800
delivery manager accountable for

207
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,720
delivery accountable for other things

208
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,440
right you might be accountable for for

209
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,160
um uh uh uh reviews you might be

210
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,680
accountable for various things if you're

211
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,680
a product owner you're

212
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,360
probably a product manager you're

213
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,200
accountable for other things within the

214
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,880
organization if you're a developer

215
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,600
although you're doing scrum you might

216
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,079
also be accountable for other things in

217
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,839
the organization you might support and

218
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,160
maintain things that are different from

219
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,720
what it is your main piece that you're

220
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,720
working on so

221
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,880
there are so many common

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,519
misconceptions and I I feel like these

223
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,760
misconceptions are so common that they

224
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,839
become

225
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,519
fact they become true like you must do

226
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:22,480
story points you must have user

227
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:26,519
stories try and move away from those

228
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,839
things try and look at do do your

229
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,800
research right understand why those

230
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,360
things exist and perhaps they are the

231
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,120
right thing for your organization or

232
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,120
your team but also perhaps they're not
