1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,080
the way we measure

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,399
people informs the way they

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,320
behave so when whenever you're working

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,040
within an

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,520
organization and you find somebody's

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,840
working against you or somebody's not um

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,840
being as involved as they you think they

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,480
should be involved and you're wondering

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,519
why there's probably some organizational

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,880
measure or metric something being levied

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:35,239
against them um leved or on them that

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,760
that enables that behavior that enables

13
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,600
ensures

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,000
encourages that that behavior in in that

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,640
person so the best way to figure

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,320
out why somebody is doing something in a

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,719
particular way that maybe you feel has a

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,920
negative impact on the way your things

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
need to happen is to figure out how how

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,640
they're measured
