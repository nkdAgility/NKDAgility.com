00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,960
scaling isn't just a Tech Challenge it's

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,360
a leadership challenge you see when

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,599
companies think about scaling they

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,519
usually focus on architecture

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,639
infrastructure and tools but the real

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,960
constraint is leadership because at

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,080
scale the way people think collaborate

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,039
and make decisions has a far bigger

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,279
impact than the technology

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,840
stat CTO cios it managers this is where

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,960
you come in it's not just about funding

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,840
more teams or throwing more engineers at

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,160
the problem it's about creating an

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,200
environment where scale is possible

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,840
where teams aren't waiting for approvals

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,399
where dependencies don't create

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,200
bottlenecks and decisions happen at the

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,719
right

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,480
level that's where naked agility comes

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,120
in we work with leadership to coach

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,840
train and embed the principles that make

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,600
skill work it's not just about

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,519
Frameworks or blueprints it's about

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,199
shaping the leadership behaviors that

25
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,840
allow organizations to grow without

26
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:08,960
grinding to a halt because if your teams

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,119
are struggling to scale chanes are it's

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,560
not the tech it's the way the

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,720
organization is being led so what's the

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
next step let's talk
