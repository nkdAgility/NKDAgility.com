Discussion of cycle time, lead time, or flow metrics is absent, and there is no reference to authoritative SLE sources. While the target audience overlaps some with SLE (practitioners of Agile), the intent and depth are focused on value-centric agility, not delivery predictability or flow metrics fundamental to SLE.
