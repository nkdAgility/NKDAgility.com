    "ai_penalty_details": "none",
    "final_score": 39.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses on clarifying misconceptions about Agile, emphasizing value delivery, avoidance of bureaucracy, experimentation, and iterative feedback. While these concepts tangentially touch on agency and adaptive change, they are presented strictly through an Agile lens—not through explicit discussions of 'Agentic Engineering' themes such as human/AI agency, engineering practices maximizing autonomy, systemic observability, or ethical AI collaboration. There is no direct mention or intentional exploration of Agentic Engineering's philosophical or technical distinctives. The examples given (Zoom.ai, FBI Sentinel) remain within the realm of agility versus speed, with no substantive discussion of decentralized decision-making, observability, DevOps craftsmanship, or AI-augmented autonomy. As such, the content is moderately aligned in intent and audience but does not substantively engage in Agentic Engineering as defined.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article promotes agility, feedback, and value-based delivery, it does not directly address or explicitly explore Agentic Engineering themes such as maximizing human or AI agency, systemic observability, or ethical AI integration. Its fit is moderate, with only tangential conceptual overlap.",
    "level": "Ignored"
