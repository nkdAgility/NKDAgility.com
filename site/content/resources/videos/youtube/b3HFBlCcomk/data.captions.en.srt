1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,519
there's an idea out there the agility

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,840
equals

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,000
speed and I think this is in the same

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,440
category

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,480
of agile project manager right it's an

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,080
oxymoron it doesn't exist it's not a

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,160
thing that's not what agility is

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,519
about agility is about spending your

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,840
time

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,119
well that's probably probably a bit I

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,040
think that's a good way to describe it

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,000
prob spending your time well the time we

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,800
do spend is on valuable Endeavors we

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,559
spend less time doing the wrong thing

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,039
and more time doing the right thing

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,760
that's the idea that we're trying to

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:47,480
achieve but in order to find the right

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,840
thing we've got to try 10 things to find

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,320
the three things that work right so the

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,840
idea that agility is about

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,800
speed is a complete

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,840
fallacy because we might have to do nine

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,200
things before we find the one thing that

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,159
works so if each of those things took

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,000
two

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,920
weeks that's 20

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,240
weeks and we did one

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,759
thing well why don't we

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,360
just decide what those 10 things are up

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
front look at them and go let's do that

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,920
one let's do number five and just do

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,960
that one thing and then we're done we've

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,720
buil a product right

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,360
well is that the right product does it

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,600
have Market fit are people going to buy

36
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,159
it is it even the right feature does it

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,360
actually provide value to the

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,479
customers we don't know any of those

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,920
things we could have just built the

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,079
wrong thing L lots of organizations fail

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,479
because of

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,119
assumptions they fail because they think

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,280
they're building the thing that they

44
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,600
want but they're but they're not they're

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,520
not building the thing that the customer

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,840
wants my favorite example was was um I

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,920
use this one I use this one a lot sorry

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,200
that um I was was they've been bought so

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,440
now the product sucks but um I was an

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,319
average user of a product called Zoom

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,280
AI right so this was an awesome product

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,120
and what it allowed you to do um was

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,120
multiple things it was basically a

54
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,080
calendaring tool right one of those

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,599
calendaring tools but its unique

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,400
Focus was on a kind of kind of Bot based

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,280
calendaring tool so you could have a you

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,519
had a bot I I use teams so I had a bot

59
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,040
in in teams that I can just go message

60
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,680
it and say um I want to meet with Simon

61
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,280
um at 4:00 on Friday go organize that

62
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,440
and it will email Simon and say Simon

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,760
Mar wants to meet at for Fridays this

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,640
work for you yes or no would you like to

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,000
pick some times that that you and Martin

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,000
have available okay pick some times and

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,560
then it comes back and that that was

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that story so it was a bot-based

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,080
interactive it was maybe a bit early

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
right

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,519
probably the the versions coming now

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,200
with AI are are going to make this a lot

73
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:20,000
more effective but it it worked um and

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,159
it was great but I and almost all of the

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,280
other customers found that they didn't

76
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,120
really use it that way what they used it

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,720
was was a calendaring tool send people a

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,239
link here's how um here's my free time

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,879
go book book a slot cuz it was just just

80
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,159
easier right you didn't even have to

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,280
write a message to some you just send

82
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
them the

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,159
link

84
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,519
so while they were Zoom Ai and this AI

85
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,840
story um they actually very much ended

86
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,200
up just changing the whole company ethos

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,480
and focus from that to calendar hero um

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,840
and they were just another calendaring

89
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,159
tool but a very good one they've been

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,200
bought by somebody else now and

91
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,480
everything has gone crap but um cuz you

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,599
know you're really good somebody comes

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,319
and buys you and then they absorb you

94
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,280
and eat you and now you're no longer

95
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,040
good but the the

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,280
that

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,600
idea of completely changing not only

98
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,680
your your business your focus um your

99
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,440
your company name is around why is your

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,039
Market fit and what a lot of big

101
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,280
organizations fail to realize is is that

102
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,919
their Market changes it's not that they

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,120
fail to realize it it's they don't

104
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,120
understand how to take advantage of it

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,360
because they build up rust right in all

106
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,360
of the bureaucracy that builds up around

107
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,720
the organization we shouldn't have a lot

108
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,120
of bureaucracy if you have a lot of

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,240
bureaucracy in your organization you're

110
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,160
doing it wrong right that's that's all

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,039
you're not able to respond to Market

112
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,000
changes quickly enough if you have a lot

113
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,520
of bureaucracy um local optimizations

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,840
right so

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,919
this comes back to that idea of agility

116
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,479
is not equal to speed the purpose of

117
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,520
agility is not to go

118
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,080
faster if you think you're going to do

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Agile to make you go faster you're wrong

120
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,960
it's not going to work that way if you

121
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,800
have 300 things to

122
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,639
do it's going to take 300 things worth

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,479
of time to do whether you do Agile

124
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,680
waterfall whatever you've got 300 things

125
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,479
to

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,240
do the way agile makes it seem like

127
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:30,039
you're going

128
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,759
faster is maybe you don't need 300

129
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,919
things maybe you only need 100

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
things that's how it might seem like

131
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,039
it's faster because we do 100 things and

132
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,000
we're

133
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,080
done right uh think of the Sentinel The

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,840
Sentinel project right that's the big

135
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,600
famous one that was the US uh FBI uh uh

136
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Records keeping system uh 1995 brand new

137
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,560
system was delivered it was green screen

138
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,960
with terminals right we all had Windows

139
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,720
95 at that point and they realized it

140
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,639
was obsolete the moment they shipped it

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,880
so they started working on the new

142
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,800
version project Sentinel right and they

143
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,120
had money from Congress so $400 million

144
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,319
and I can't remember the company might

145
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,319
have been ly Martin that was building it

146
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,400
um and they spent four years $400

147
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,639
million and at the end of that they

148
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,360
didn't have a working product no working

149
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,479
product so they had to go to Congress

150
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,080
get more money $300 million 5 years

151
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:34,800
spent $300 million another 5 years

152
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,720
no working product right not very

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,319
fast got

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,440
to I don't know

155
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,120
2012 they've been going for nearly 10

156
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,400
years this project had been going for

157
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,120
nearly 10 years maybe 2005 anyway nearly

158
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,319
10 years and um they decided to quit the

159
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,240
whole thing they took the best people

160
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,240
out of the the group that they had

161
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,879
building it they hired them the FBI

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,840
physically hired the people people um

163
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,080
set up scrum teams in the basement of

164
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,560
the Hoover building so they had about 40

165
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,759
people went from 400 people to 40 people

166
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,800
and they delivered to production within

167
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,199
a year so you could say that they went

168
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,000
faster but they didn't go faster they

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,199
just didn't try and build the whole

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,440
thing they just built the first

171
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,599
piece right they got to production

172
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,680
within a year that's the speed that

173
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,520
we're talking about we're not actually

174
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,360
talking about delivering what you

175
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,560
thought you were going to get faster

176
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
you're going to get a better product in

177
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,680
the same amount of time so the best way

178
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,960
to think about it is if we have a let's

179
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,400
say it cost $10,000 per Sprint um we've

180
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,919
got $100,000 we can do 10

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,560
Sprints we can do five things per

182
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,960
Sprint do we just do these 50 things we

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,199
decide up front or do we figure out as

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,479
we go which 50 things are the best 50

185
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,599
things to build we've still spent

186
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,919
exactly the same amount of time but we

187
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,400
have a better 50 things that we've

188
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,599
delivered we've got 50 of the wrer

189
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,759
things than just the 50 things we

190
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:15,440
thought we needed at the start and

191
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:15,440
that's why agile is not about speed
