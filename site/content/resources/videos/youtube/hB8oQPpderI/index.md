# One limitation of a book versus a scrum course.

#shorts #agile books are great. You can learn a great deal about #scrum, #kanban, or any other #agileframework from reading a great book. In fact, to become successful in our field, you need to read a lot of books, blogs, articles, and white papers to master the field.

That said, when you're starting out or looking to level up, a book can only take you so far. #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching, and #mentoring from a strong professional in the field is incredibly important in that journey to mastery.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the one limitation of learning from a book versus attending a #scrumtraining course.
