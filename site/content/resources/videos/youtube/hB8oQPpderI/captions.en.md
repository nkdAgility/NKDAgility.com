So what's one limitation of reading a book versus attending a course? 

Um, a book can answer your questions. That's a limitation. A book doesn't have a bunch of other people in the same position as you and saying, asking other and different questions that also might be of value to you as well as you're going through the content. 

Um, reading the book is great. There are lots of great books on agile. Um, I think the value in attending a physical class is that you're able to have those discussions, talk about the different ideas, share your opinion of those different ideas, and perhaps that will sway the people in the room or perhaps you'll be swayed by the counter arguments.
