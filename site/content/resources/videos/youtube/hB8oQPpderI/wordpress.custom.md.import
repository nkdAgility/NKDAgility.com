**One limitation of reading a book vs attending a course**

## Books vs Interaction

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for reading and it's no secret that I love books.Â  ðŸ“–

For centuries books have offered incredible insights and knowledge to millions of people.Â  However, when it comes to humans, there's one limitation of reading a book that I want to address today: a book can't answer your questions.

For me, being unable to answer questions is a huge restriction.Â  A book can't engage in discussions or respond to your or other course attendees' thoughts.Â  And a book certainly can't share experiences or spark conversations with others who might be struggling with similar questions or challenges. ðŸ§©

Attending a course brings you into an engaging place of interactive learning.

In a course environment, you're not just absorbing information, you're actively engaging, debating, and exchanging ideas with fellow learners.

We all know that the power of conversation, the exchange of perspectives, and the benefits of shared understanding can shape your learning journey in unique ways that a reading experience cannot. ðŸš€

I urge you not to overlook the value of attending a course and keep reading. Â The whole philosophy behind my Agile and Scrum courses is to create an environment that facilitates thought-provoking discussions, encourages curiosity, and promotes collaborative learning.

Don't just read, interact!
