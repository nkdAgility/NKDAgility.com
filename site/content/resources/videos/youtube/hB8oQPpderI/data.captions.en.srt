1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,200
so what's one limitation of reading a

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,559
book versus attending a course

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,740
um a book can answer your questions that

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,199
that's a that's a limitation a book

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,199
doesn't have a bunch of other people in

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,660
the same position as you and saying

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,779
asking other and different questions

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,140
that also might be of value to you as

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,539
well as you're going through the content

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,719
um reading reading the book is great

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,559
there are lots of great books on agile

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,860
um I think the value in attending a a

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,079
physical class is that you're able to

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,960
have those discussions talk about the

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,020
different ideas share your opinion of

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,480
those different ideas and perhaps that

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,180
will sway the people in the room or

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,840
perhaps you'll be swayed by the counter

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,840
arguments
