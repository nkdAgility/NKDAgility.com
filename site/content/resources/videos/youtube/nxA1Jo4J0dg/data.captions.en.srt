00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799
the scaled professional scrum is a

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,040
hands-on activity-based course where

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,440
students develop a collection of skills

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,480
that can be applied to overcome

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,880
challenges when scaling scrum even after

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,880
achieving success with scrum teams are

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,000
still limited by the amount of work they

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
can do and the value they can create

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
they need to expand or scale to groups

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,760
of scrum teams working together on the

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
same product

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,439
with doing so they encounter common

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,399
challenges with cross-team dependencies

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,719
self-management transparency and

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,680
accountability when introducing

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,559
heavyweight scaling methodologies teams

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
often find that the added overhead slows

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
them down

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,399
and distracts them from the essence and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
benefits of scrum the scaled

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
professional scrum with nexus class

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,360
builds on the nexus framework by

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,399
introducing complementary practices and

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,960
techniques proven to help teams at scale

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,960
the course also includes a free attempt

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,199
at the globally recognized scaled

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,200
professional scrum certification exam

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,840
our training is delivered as an

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,080
interactive activity-based course over

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
half-day sessions using microsoft teams

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,320
and mural

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,920
students work together in a nexus to

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
organize and simulate a scaled product

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
development project

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,840
throughout this case study based class

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,520
common challenges in scaling are

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,840
presented and more than 50 practices for

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,479
overcoming them are revealed students

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,840
will develop an understanding of how to

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,720
launch structure organize and manage a

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
large agile project using scrum

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,200
they will leave the class with a toolbox

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,600
of techniques for identifying and

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,240
overcoming common scaling challenges

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,399
between each of the daily sessions we

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,799
