00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,060
The Scaled Professional Scrum is a hands-on,
activity-based course where students develop

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,759
a collection of skills that can be applied
to overcome challenges when scaling Scrum.

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,880
Even after achieving success with Scrum, teams
are still limited by the amount of work they

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,070
can do and the value they can create. They
need to expand, or scale, to a group of Scrum

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,349
Teams working together on the same product.
When doing so, they often encounter common

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,899
challenges with cross-team dependencies, self-management,
transparency and accountability.

7
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:42,740
When introducing heavy-weight scaling methodologies,
teams often find that the added overhead slows

8
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,143
down the teams and distracts from the essence
and benefits of Scrum. Instead, the Nexus

9
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:48,143
Framework minimally extended the Scrum Framework
to include ways that help solve the dependency

10
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,143
and collaboration challenges of cross-team
work. Since Nexus enhances the foundational

11
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,143
elements of Scrum, it reinforces the benefits
of Scrum while also being familiar to those

12
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:51,143
that have used Scrum.

13
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:52,519
The Scaled Professional Scrumâ¢ (SPS) with
Nexus course, builds on the Nexus framework

14
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,650
by introducing complementary practices and
techniques proven to help teams scale. The

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,960
course also includes a free attempt at the
globally recognized Scaled Professional Scrum

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,449
(SPS) certification exam.

17
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,840
Our training is delivered as an interactive,
activity-based course over half-day sessions

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,030
using Microsoft Teams, and Mural.

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:20,710
Students work together in a Nexus to organize
and simulate a scaled product development

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,020
project. This case study-based class presents
common challenges in scaling and more than

21
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,920
fifty practices for overcoming them are revealed.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,659
Students will develop an understanding of
how to launch, structure, organize, and manage

23
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:43,719
a large Agile project using Scrum. They will
leave the class with a toolbox of techniques

24
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,710
for identifying and overcoming common scaling
challenges.

25
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:54,840
Between sessions, we provide additional reading,
writing, and watching activities to maximise

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,659
the learning opportunities and complement
the classroom experience.

27
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,130
After the conclusion of the class, we provide
access to a community of peers and continued

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,380
access to the trainer through office hours,
quarterly catchups, and constant engagement.

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:16,410
To maximise validated learning, all students
are given a password to take the SPS assessment,

30
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,470
and if they take it within 14 days and are
unsuccessful, they will be granted a second

31
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,470
attempt.

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,780
As part of our validated learning experience,
we provide a 30-minute learning review, a

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,480
1h coaching session, and access to future
courses at a 30% discount on future classes.
