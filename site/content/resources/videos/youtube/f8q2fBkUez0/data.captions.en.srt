um so to set the stage for for the

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
conversation again we talking about

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,200
money the post that you did a couple

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,480
weeks ago Michael um had some themes

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,239
around financial literacy

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,959
and general

71
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,319
again I'll I'll leave it there financial

72
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,239
literacy is that enough to to guide you

73
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
into your point of view on that

74
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,200
particular

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:47,360
topic Michael that that's

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,879
you oh that was my C good I didn't so so

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,879
I can bring the post up if you want but

78
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,000
it was it was um should should companies

79
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:58,599
take money off the table that was

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,760
that Alfie con Dan ping says you take

81
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:05,400
money off the table is beautiful and

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:09,439
then you you came in with a a not that

83
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,519
so exactly so uh there's uh one very

84
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,959
interesting proverb I picked up in my uh

85
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,759
student time and that's everything wor

86
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,160
doing is wor

87
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,840
overdoing so that is basically where we

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,120
get from uh so of course uh I know that

89
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:30,639
the original intent of Dan pink is uh to

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,320
say that uh I don't want people to be uh

91
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,520
worried about their

92
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,039
livelihood because it distracts them

93
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,280
from achieving the things that they're

94
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,240
setting out to achieve and that is not

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,039
something that uh we would like to have

96
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,039
in a company uh but of course uh I'm

97
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,680
taking this one a bit further and it's

98
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,759
also based a lot on uh investigation a

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,120
lot of experience in organizational

100
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,120
transformation organizational change

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,919
observing also from the good old times

102
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,199
of being a project maner manager or

103
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:07,720
system architect that uh the financial

104
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,479
conversation is usually very very

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
hard and friend of mine recently also

106
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,000
gave this example so you have this team

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,000
of developers they working in their

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,240
traditional way of working and

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,560
everybody's somehow happy the salaries

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,000
are paid everybody has a stable job

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,960
nobody needs to worry anything and uh so

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,919
they have this issue that they're doing

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,800
three release per year which is not even

114
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,720
once a quarter but every like three or

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,319
four months more like it and uh of

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,600
course they're always doing work but uh

117
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,880
then when the release comes first you

118
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,759
come the release packaging then comes uh

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,000
release testing the debugging preparing

120
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,880
the release release coordination all of

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,600
those kind of things and uh so does this

122
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,639
team have a problem yes or no and a team

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,880
somehow starts to argue yeah you know

124
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,000
what nowadays modern and uh cicd and we

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,000
should make the transition and what do

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,680
you think the manager understands oh the

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,720
Nerds want a new toy what does the

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,960
manager say no we've got serious work to

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,120
do so what they're failing is the commun

130
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,280
conversation about how much does this

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,880
process cost us so we're spending like

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,479
uh 60 days for a whole team just on the

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,319
release uh Management on the release

134
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:38,960
process every quarter or every four

135
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,039
months that is uh 60 days cost how much

136
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
let's just say $1,000 per developer per

137
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,319
day so 60,000 per developer you have a

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,039
team of 10 people we're talking 600,000

139
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,360
three times a year we're

140
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,759
talking over $2

141
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,720
million for what what do we get for that

142
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,879
what is the value we produce and that is

143
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,000
a kind of a different conversation and

144
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,360
yeah we would like to introduce

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,879
continuous delivery because it's a

146
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,800
better process because it's more modern

147
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,879
and it's kind of a conversation many

148
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,280
people are not able to lead and because

149
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,840
they have never

150
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,000
considered how much are we spending on

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,639
what and what is the returns that we are

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,160
getting because they do not have the

153
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,240
literacy to even think in those terms

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,160
and what I just told you is really

155
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,199
really really simple Mass one developer

156
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,840
one day 1,000 dollar 10 developers is

157
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,680
10,000 60 days is 600,000 there's no

158
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,280
magic to this it's not like you need to

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,199
have studied accounting or an MBA in

160
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,599
order to do this kind of thing but

161
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,120
people struggle to have this

162
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,919
conversation

163
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,120
because like I said the money for teis

164
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,159
has been taken off the table they are

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
happy we get a fixed salary can we can

166
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,960
live from this salary we can pay our

167
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,639
rent and where the money comes from or

168
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,360
where the money goes that's my manager's

169
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,360
problem but like that they are bringing

170
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,960
themselves into a situation where they

171
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,039
are unable to make the impact that they

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,440
need to make in order to do the best

173
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,440
possible

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,360
job all right we let that sit for a

175
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:23,319
moment thank you Michael Martin you had

176
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,280
a response to that in public I'll hang

177
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,879
you out there to when you go yeah

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,680
so so I I mean there's there's

179
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,760
absolutely nothing wrong um with what

180
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,640
what Michael said I think I think he is

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,320
correct that there is a a an

182
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,040
epidemic of organization people in

183
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,360
organizations that don't understand what

184
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,399
their time and their group time costs to

185
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:56,600
the business um costs to the customers

186
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,240
so they're making decisions and making

187
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,640
as as as you know Ryan Michael but every

188
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,399
developer every person in your

189
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,480
organization all the way up the chain

190
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:07,480
makes lots of micro decisions every day

191
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,000
within the context of what you know

192
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,760
their knowledge and expertise that they

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,279
don't go ask anybody but they make those

194
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,920
decisions and those decisions cost the

195
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,200
business money and are they making the

196
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,640
right decisions or are they making the

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,600
wrong ones and I fully agree that they

198
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,640
should be making those

199
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,560
decisions within the context of

200
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,560
understanding what it costs to do

201
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,680
business um I used to work on a a scrum

202
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,279
team with an Australian company and we

203
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,120
knew that our scrum team was charged to

204
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,920
the customer so this was it's a

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,040
consulting company so that includes

206
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,839
margin as well um for $60,000 a Sprint

207
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,839
so this was Australian dollars right so

208
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,959
$60,000 for for for for two weeks so we

209
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,360
we were looking at every

210
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:59,519
Sprint thinking about well if the

211
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,839
customer is giving us $60,000 and we're

212
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,959
doing this work what are we providing

213
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,200
for them what are we doing next what's

214
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,800
the most valuable thing we can do to

215
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,640
spend their

216
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,000
$60,000 um and that that's absolute

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,519
absolutely

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,440
key but I think that is completely

219
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:26,240
unrelated to the Dan pink story it might

220
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,399
be anecdotally related as in um a a a

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,519
manager that sucks or an organization

222
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,480
that sucks and I'm using sucks in a

223
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,880
totally bad manner there but um that

224
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,399
isn't very good that doesn't understand

225
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,160
these Concepts um might equate the two

226
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,639
and thus we end up with a with a the

227
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,680
difficult comp conflation that M

228
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,959
Michael's talking about but the idea of

229
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,839
me as an

230
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:57,279
employee and my personal outlook on my

231
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,519
finances and having enough as an

232
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,079
individual with my family nothing to do

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,639
with the business the the the the the

234
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,680
the the the business that's

235
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,560
running that's a totally different story

236
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,600
that's a personal story to the business

237
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,160
operating cost story although my

238
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,519
personal story of how much I earn and

239
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,920
how much is provided to me is a number

240
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:25,480
on the accounting for that right but for

241
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,000
me this is a personal story of if I'm

242
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,320
sitting here this is the Dan pink idea

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
if I'm sitting here worried about being

244
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,560
able to pay my

245
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,920
rent I'm not going to be focused on

246
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,160
solving the business problems I'm going

247
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,279
to be focused on worrying to pay my rent

248
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,839
me having enough so I'm not worried

249
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,880
about the intrinsic Mo extrinsic

250
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,639
motivations and can focus on the

251
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,560
intrinsic motivations of autonomy

252
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:57,639
Mastery and purpose does not

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,040
precludes me understanding how much I

254
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,560
and my team and the work that we're

255
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,120
doing costs to the business or the

256
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,000
customers they should definitely

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,279
understand that stuff but I think I my

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,680
belief is they're they're they're two un

259
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm I'm going to say they're two

260
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,000
unrelated and separate stories however

261
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,199
the outcome of the personal story is a

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,880
line item on the accounting on the other

263
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,440
story if that makes sense that's that's

264
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,240
the way I think about

265
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:31,600
it actually in this one and uh this may

266
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,240
be my person I'll take

267
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,480
here I have a company

268
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,399
too how do you separate me as a person

269
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,000
from the company I

270
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,320
run it's probably pretty difficult

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,680
because I I identify as this company and

272
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,040
this company exists because of me if

273
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,600
this company is in financial trouble so

274
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,360
am I and the other way around so for me

275
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,000
as a business owner it is absolutely n

276
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,760
natural that every financial decision

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,600
every product decision every development

278
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,600
decision I have to take from two angles

279
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,240
even the question do I go into the cloud

280
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,800
do I rent the VM do I host this stuff by

281
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,279
myself is made from a perspective of

282
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,199
this one ultimately it hits my pocket so

283
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,000
I have a different way of making

284
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:28,199
decisions uh then I would have as an

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
employee who doesn't care where the Bill

286
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:34,160
Gets Sent and how big it is and even you

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,959
have this I mean I'm joking in this one

288
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,800
because what we're talking about is five

289
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,839
or 10 dollars but still the point stays

290
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,120
that if you have financial

291
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
responsibility for your own business

292
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,639
because it affects you personally you

293
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,680
make different decisions than if it's

294
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,839
completely

295
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:57,160
detached sure but that's not an employee

296
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,880
issue that's a business owner issue and

297
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,480
there is only one or two or three of you

298
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,079
in a particular business maybe a little

299
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,120
bit more depending on the scale of the

300
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,160
business and then there's hundreds of

301
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,639
other people who are the people doing

302
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,480
the work that actually don't care about

303
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,560
that story explicitly because the the

304
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,000
success of that story for you as a

305
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,560
business owner lines your pocket it does

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,440
nothing for the employees but if the

307
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,639
business makes a 100 million more profit

308
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,759
this year I don't get any more as an

309
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,759
employee in my pay check Mo for in most

310
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:38,399
companies unless this profit share right

311
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:41,519
um but as a as a as a business owner um

312
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,440
and as a business owner myself I I do

313
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:50,040
separate those things right my my my

314
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:54,160
success as a business owner means I earn

315
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,240
more money right because it's my it's my

316
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,440
business so but I need to be

317
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,600
conscious as a business owner that

318
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,959
that's not how my employees think and

319
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,880
that's not how they're supposed to think

320
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,440
and even all of that doesn't

321
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,720
preclude those employees taking care of

322
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,440
the pennies and pounds a a great example

323
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,519
of this is um what they've done in

324
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,480
Jaguar Land Rover recently so one of the

325
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,639
things that they found um they they were

326
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,120
they were doing a bunch of analysis

327
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,399
on why why did this disaster happen they

328
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
disaster that cost them something like2

329
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,680
$300

330
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:41,040
million and it was it the fundamental

331
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:43,360
rot cause of this problem was an aging

332
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,279
machine that was creating slightly

333
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,880
faulty Parts like they were good enough

334
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,399
but not good enough long term so they

335
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,399
had to be replaced later and that was

336
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,399
much more

337
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,759
expensive and this machine was run by a

338
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,560
person and they asked that person why

339
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,920
didn't you request a new machine and

340
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,279
they're like I've requested a new

341
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,279
machine every year for the past five

342
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:10,639
years but what happened in that story is

343
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,240
that that that um request went up in the

344
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,279
organization to somebody who it wasn't

345
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,279
in their budget for this year because

346
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,120
perhaps they were you know looking at

347
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,800
looking after the shareholders right and

348
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,839
we want to have a certain amount so we

349
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,440
can't afford $5 million for a new

350
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:29,160
machine and they would deny that

351
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,800
request so the change that they made in

352
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,680
the

353
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,920
organization was they now allow every

354
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,440
single person in the organization to

355
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,839
approve any amount of spend and that

356
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,000
sounds ridiculous that sounds like

357
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,480
people within the organization will just

358
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
start spending money willy-nilly and you

359
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,160
know you're you're you're then

360
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:55,040
hemorrhaging cash but they created this

361
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,519
this understanding of kind of spend it

362
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,639
like it's your own money right would you

363
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,639
spend this money on this thing

364
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,439
and that's kind of that's orthagonal but

365
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,600
related to what what it is we're talking

366
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:10,160
about right that that we want the people

367
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,039
doing the work regardless of whether

368
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,839
they are owners in the business or not

369
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:17,079
if you're doing doing work if you're

370
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,679
making decisions you want them making

371
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:23,199
decisions with the understanding of the

372
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,120
context the operating context of the

373
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,959
business the costs that we're running

374
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,039
and things that are happening and and I

375
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,160
absolutely one thing I totally agree

376
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:37,160
with you Michael I I see time and

377
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,919
again especially in Professional

378
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,440
Services

379
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,080
organizations where they seem they seem

380
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:48,480
to deliberately

381
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,160
Shield the the they seem to deliberately

382
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,080
Shield the people doing the work from

383
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,320
the costs of the work um I was just

384
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,080
working in a in a in an organization

385
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,919
where I think we had the group group

386
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,360
that I was in that was about 150 people

387
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,200
working with the customer right and this

388
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,919
was this is Mega ridiculous cost you you

389
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,840
probably would talk about an operating

390
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,520
cost per day of about 2,000 two to2 and

391
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,440
a half thousand maybe $33,000 to the

392
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,840
customer right so $3,000 a day per

393
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,559
person 150 people that's that's more

394
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,159
than a that's holy crap that's like more

395
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,320
than 400,000 my math in my head sucks

396
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,120
Michael sorry it's more than 400,000 per

397
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,400
day it's a lot a lot of

398
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,280
money and what what were they getting

399
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,000
for it people were sitting doing make

400
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,679
work because they couldn't think of what

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,960
to do but they didn't fundamentally

402
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,159
understand the cost of the business they

403
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,919
didn't understand what they were being

404
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,480
charged to the business to the customer

405
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,159
they didn't understand how much money

406
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,000
they were burning just sitting there not

407
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,280
doing anything for a day so they weren't

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,720
making

409
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,080
decisions with context and it's that

410
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,320
context that's important and and I very

411
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,120
much agree that lots of businesses think

412
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,320
that they have to Shield their staff

413
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,520
from the cost of actually doing business

414
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,200
and I think that's

415
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,679
wrong exactly and that is the point

416
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,520
where where I said this is the

417
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:23,320
point where I said that look really and

418
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,240
I was teasing with this post quoting

419
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,159
then ping take the money off the table

420
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,840
of course because uh this is the point

421
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,760
where it go goes wrong when you run your

422
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,000
business and say I do not want for any

423
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,799
reason whatever not picking out anything

424
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,840
my employees to know the financial

425
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,960
impact of what they are doing at that

426
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,200
point you're hurting your own business

427
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,240
you cannot run a successful business if

428
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,039
you're surrounded by people who don't

429
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,760
know the consequences of their actions

430
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,880
from a financial

431
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,120
perspective I I guess then I really

432
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,280
don't understand why you put down on the

433
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,679
table because they're completely

434
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,080
unrelated things right so I I know

435
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,559
you're saying you're you're you're

436
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,919
you're teasing right but even even even

437
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,559
when you're when you're teasing it it if

438
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,320
you're making an analogy between two

439
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,760
things they have to be the same thing

440
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,159
and I think they're fundamentally not

441
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,360
the same thing and that's what that's

442
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,120
what triggered me to reply right is that

443
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,720
because because I I guess I I got

444
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,919
suckered I'm easy to be triggered right

445
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,840
um I have I definitely I I have I have

446
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,880
an Asbergers coach and helps me very

447
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,919
much on on not poking at things but for

448
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,440
for some when when they're ABS the issue

449
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,919
I I I have is not that when when you're

450
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,240
reating these two things that are

451
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,360
radically different even even in kind of

452
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,080
in G right it's it's not for the likes

453
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:53,039
of us who are practitioners within this

454
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,320
space who could potentially fully

455
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,880
understand that oh yeah Michael's just

456
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,880
taking a rip at Dan pink to try and H

457
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
you

458
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,440
know get engagement and talk about the

459
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,919
topic and

460
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:13,080
Views yeah but pull pull it apart a

461
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:16,360
little bit um but but what what about

462
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,600
all of the people out there who stumble

463
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,000
upon your

464
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,559
post and what they read and if they if

465
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,600
they read your post and they're not in

466
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,080
that context of understanding these

467
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,360
Concepts they're going to read

468
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,520
um Dan Pink's ideas are crap they're not

469
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,200
what we want to be looking at and we

470
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,039
should disregard everything he's talking

471
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,760
about that that's what I feel that they

472
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,679
would hear which is why I quite I quite

473
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,000
often Ryan will know this because he we

474
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,400
follow each other as well I quite often

475
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,720
reply to posts based on that context

476
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,720
right I'm not actually replying to the

477
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,240
person who made the post I'm replying to

478
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,640
all the other people who would read that

479
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,000
post and maybe the at least I can save

480
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,640
some percentage of them for getting the

481
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,480
from getting the wrong end of the stick

482
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,120
that's a that's a British idiom what's

483
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,480
wrong end of the stick would be getting

484
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:17,520
the wrong idea right misinterpreting

485
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,640
misinterpreting the joke as as as a as a

486
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,799
reality and I think it's very easy to

487
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,880
make those make those

488
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,720
conflations that result what's the

489
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,960
what's the the um dual track agile

490
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,159
that's a really famous one right where

491
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,159
are you familiar with Joel track agile

492
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,480
yeah so track

493
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,600
AG it's this

494
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,200
idea

495
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,200
sorry

496
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,960
go means the ability to do the right

497
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,200
thing at the right time so duel track is

498
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,640
uh let's have the ability to sometimes

499
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,679
do the right thing isn't that better

500
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,600
than doing it all the time yeah so so

501
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,679
this is this is yeah this is Joel track

502
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,039
agil was essentially this a paper

503
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,400
talking about this idea that there are

504
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,799
there are two types of work right you've

505
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,159
got Discovery work and you've got

506
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,400
delivery work and you need to do both

507
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,960
and the same people need to e and flow

508
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,600
between that work depending on how you

509
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,120
know if you don't know about something

510
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,320
you're going to spend more time on that

511
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,840
Discovery track if you know a lot about

512
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,080
it and you're just executing on it

513
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
you'll maybe spend a little bit more

514
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,799
time on that delivery track

515
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,919
but lots of people read that and then

516
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,640
post about dual track agile being you

517
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,360
need a delivery team and a discovery

518
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
team and they end up being two

519
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:44,039
completely separate teams and then we

520
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,240
all have to spend a whole bunch of time

521
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,480
and effort explaining to people that no

522
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,360
that when people say that that's not

523
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,360
what it was talking about you end up

524
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,799
having to to explain away those those

525
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,080
those issues and I just felt that there

526
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,640
was a danger in the comment that you

527
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,679
made of that that similar idea happening

528
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:10,120
that disconnect between your your your

529
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:13,120
intent and what what we want to help

530
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,679
people understand and what Dan pink was

531
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,240
trying to help people understand which

532
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:21,039
is that intrinsic extrinsic motivation

533
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:24,440
thing which is separate from that

534
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,480
business operating cost as part of the

535
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,480
context that every employee should

536
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,480
understand

537
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:38,240
interestingly I would say yeah I am not

538
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,600
so sure that uh how to say and like you

539
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,159
say maybe business owners are a little

540
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,880
bit different than the regular employees

541
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:49,799
and the question of uh should money be a

542
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:55,399
motivating factor but then I even come

543
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,399
back to the concept how can you promote

544
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,120
entrepreneurship not entrepreneurship

545
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,840
but

546
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,559
entrepreneurship if your employees don't

547
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,960
have this

548
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,600
mindset Whi which mindset are we talking

549
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,960
about because there's the mindset of

550
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,760
they they they're they're happy and

551
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,679
successful and feel like they can spend

552
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,279
more time focusing on the work because

553
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:24,440
we've taken money off the table at home

554
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,880
versus the business focus of we need to

555
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,720
understand the financial motivations

556
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,640
within the context of business for

557
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,480
business and I don't think that piece is

558
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,200
any different between an employee and a

559
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,559
business owner right it shouldn't be if

560
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,120
we can agree that it shouldn't be I'm

561
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:43,039
with you the problem is in practice it

562
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,640
too often is very very

563
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,640
different why why is

564
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,640
it why does that

565
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,440
happen I've got an idea on

566
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,679
that it's a very good question

567
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,520
ultimately I mean uh just look you

568
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,919
brought this up that the employee they

569
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,279
do not think like the business owner so

570
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,840
uh yes I agree with you so what's the I

571
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,000
do agree I mean I was thinking about

572
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,399
this one from my own perspective I used

573
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,880
to be an employee for a long number of

574
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,640
years and when I transitioned into

575
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,799
freelancing into being a business owner

576
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,640
this shift it took me like I would say

577
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,840
like three or four years to start

578
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,919
thinking

579
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:34,279
differently I mean in part it is like

580
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:36,600
you said because as an employee there

581
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,919
are other people making this decision

582
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,840
for me I I used to work for a company

583
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,039
where I was out of the loop I did not

584
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,399
know the company's finances except for

585
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,760
yeah we don't have enough money for a

586
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:53,880
Race So So this go ahead go ahead I

587
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,799
think you're gonna come back in there

588
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,600
yeah I think I I I I think there's a fun

589
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,480
there's a fundamental why here that's

590
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,240
really important which is which is why

591
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,640
um historically that thing that we're

592
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,720
talking about has happened that we've

593
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
disconnect that businesses have

594
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,159
systematically and deliberately

595
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,919
disconnected their employees um from the

596
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,159
financial Runnings of the business and

597
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,919
it's fundamentally so that they don't

598
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:23,360
discover what their colleagues are being

599
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:26,200
paid because they pay them differently I

600
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,240
had and purly I I had this exact

601
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,080
circumstance I used to work for a little

602
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,840
company called Merl Lynch uh you might

603
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,159
have yeah it was not fun Ryan was not

604
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:43,519
fun I sub Prime Mortgage as well so it

605
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:46,120
was even worse pre 2008 um the the so I

606
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,960
I was having a conversation with one of

607
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,919
my

608
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,760
colleagues and I

609
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,159
offhandedly not even thinking of of of

610
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,480
the ramifications offhandedly said oh

611
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,519
we've just cuz we we'd all just got our

612
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,640
and pay Rises and stuff and I

613
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,440
offhandedly said oh now I'm in the 40%

614
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,840
tax bracket this that's going to kind of

615
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,840
suck

616
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,960
right and my colleague who did exactly

617
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,559
the same job as me was incredibly pissed

618
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
because they were nowhere near that 40%

619
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,039
tax bracket yeah so they go they go to

620
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
their boss and I get in I get I get into

621
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,720
trouble rather than them getting into

622
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,760
trouble for not paying them properly I

623
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,039
get into trouble for letting slip

624
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,919
funnily enough that was in 2007 and in

625
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,720
2008 in the UK that became protected

626
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:44,120
speech right because in many places

627
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,000
it's I know it's to it it everybody

628
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,840
should be talking to this is part of how

629
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,519
we break this cycle Michael is that

630
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,279
every employee should be talking to each

631
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,039
other about the financial stories how

632
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:00,840
much do we earn should be open

633
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,440
information within an

634
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,559
organization it absolutely it absolutely

635
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,919
should and in I think in Most states in

636
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,600
the US is now isn't it protected speech

637
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:12,240
as well or is it federally protected I

638
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,840
think it might be federally

639
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,200
protected you're as an employer you're

640
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,679
not allowed to say to your employees you

641
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,320
can't tell each other about if you don't

642
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,279
want to you don't it's not you're not

643
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,840
forced to talk about it right yeah i'

644
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,799
I'd have to I'd have to check into the

645
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,240
legality of it um but that seems that it

646
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,799
seems like it would be a more companyto

647
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,279
company kind of compliance issue I'm not

648
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,240
sure

649
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,159
regulations protect it and that's that's

650
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,360
again this is completely BS as far as

651
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm concerned I think as far as you're

652
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,640
concerned what I was gonna say is going

653
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,240
to Michael's point and then coming back

654
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,080
what when you become a a contract when

655
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,960
you have your own business what are you

656
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,080
you're

657
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,279
independent well what do what does that

658
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,200
mean you are dependent on yourself for

659
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,880
your financial awareness and your

660
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,720
business acument and that kind kind of

661
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,200
those things but when you are employed

662
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,039
by a company who has the financial

663
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,159
information and controls the

664
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,679
compensation about who they decide where

665
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,279
you are ranked what are you you're

666
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:17,480
dependent it creates a dependency

667
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,159
relationship and then I think that was

668
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,360
that was evidenced Martin by that

669
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,279
situation is that oh well we're

670
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,720
dependent on this other person to give

671
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,519
well hey boss uh you know Martin's

672
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,799
telling me this and then then seeking

673
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,120
some other authority as opposed to

674
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,880
having a conversation where the

675
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,240
structure set up for you to have that

676
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,120
conversation and and and I I agree with

677
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:41,840
you I mean we we Ryan and I both went on

678
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:45,640
the same master class so we know uh um

679
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,679
that I I the reality is in many

680
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,760
organizations though that you do have

681
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,720
that situation even with the the the the

682
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,480
the best intentions of leadership when

683
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,880
it comes down to salaries and stuff you

684
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,200
normally I'm not saying it's the right

685
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,960
I'm not saying it's good but you

686
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,360
normally end up in that hierarchy issue

687
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,399
with line line management and

688
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,639
discussions of salary perhaps with HR

689
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,960
right and I think that the the that does

690
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:15,840
fundamentally have to change I think I

691
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,000
don't fully understand what that would

692
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,720
look like in an Ideal World and maybe

693
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,440
there is no ideal and it's company to

694
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:27,679
company and that kind of thing but I I

695
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,840
I I did see who was the the web guy from

696
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,639
new New York that used to be very active

697
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,880
I think he's retired now um he had a

698
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:39,159
company and he published his all of his

699
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,440
salaries for all of his employees were

700
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:42,679
published internally in the organization

701
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,039
and they had

702
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,279
levels because it wasn't R alio was

703
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,880
it I can't remember but guy but this was

704
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,279
an engineering they were software

705
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,039
development company um and it was just

706
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,679
it was very interesting and and he would

707
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,559
he would open source that story right

708
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,039
and say Here's the story here's what I'm

709
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,559
thinking and actually publish it

710
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,039
publicly and then say what what do you

711
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,240
think is this going to work what are the

712
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:10,480
things that might not work and I think

713
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,279
that kind of open

714
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,720
discussion I actually I don't understand

715
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,120
where the closed salary discussion comes

716
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,720
from me

717
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,639
personally and this is this is a Martin

718
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,720
thing I'm quite happy to tell anybody

719
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:30,440
what I earn

720
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,559
right but but I definitely feel like

721
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,279
most

722
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,279
people feel like it's secret

723
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,000
information yeah I'm not sure where that

724
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,720
comes

725
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,720
from there's also a lot how to say

726
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,279
there's also a

727
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,080
cultural element to this I know that in

728
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:56,600
Germany there's this uh PR you don't

729
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,639
talk about money you have

730
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,120
it but literally that is part of the

731
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,559
problem that the people the business

732
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,519
owners who have access to the money they

733
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,279
don't talk about it so that other people

734
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,080
don't know and like you already

735
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,240
mentioned it creates a dependency it

736
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,080
creates a power slope and uh even

737
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,000
bringing this one back to the point of

738
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,360
taking the money off the

739
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,399
table as a regular employee will I ever

740
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,000
know whether I am being paid enough to

741
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,519
be silent or whether I am being paid as

742
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,200
much as I am

743
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,480
worse how do I find out for that one I

744
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,559
need to understand what my contribution

745
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,159
to the company is because if I

746
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,760
understand this I can argue look because

747
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,519
of me you're making 50 million how about

748
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,519
my share is just two of that it's an

749
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,840
entirely different story of I would like

750
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,320
a race yeah but financial situation is

751
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,279
difficult well per perhaps employee

752
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,200
employe the employee employer

753
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,960
relationship ship has had its time right

754
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,600
Perhaps Perhaps it should be business

755
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:09,000
owner to business owner relationship and

756
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:11,359
everybody we hire in our organization is

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,919
I I always found it weird this Ryan

758
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,320
won't get maybe won't get this and I'm

759
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,520
not sure what happens in Germany I found

760
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,280
it weird Ryan that I had to do my tax

761
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,320
returns when I went to the

762
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,599
US in the UK you don't do a tax return a

763
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,000
normal employee does not do a tax return

764
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:34,599
it's done for you by the by your company

765
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,280
and the tax man

766
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,639
why

767
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,119
yeah because that's how it's that's how

768
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,119
it's done here same reason we don't have

769
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,800
sales tax and it's all included in the

770
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,720
price you pay the price on the ticket is

771
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:52,200
the price you pay right um the the the

772
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,040
the salary I get is the salary I get and

773
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,079
I don't have to worry about how much tax

774
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,599
I've paid I don't have to that's all

775
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,800
taken care of by your

776
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,680
employer

777
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,480
right how does that different so this is

778
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,839
very interesting I had no idey how is

779
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,800
that different in Germany Michael yeah

780
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:12,000
actually it's very interesting the Texas

781
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
is

782
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,839
probably it's been a running gag for a

783
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,079
long time that uh sometimes politicians

784
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:25,040
like to advertise uh that

785
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,800
uh one it was like 10 years ago they

786
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,800
said that maybe there we should should

787
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,920
simplify the tax system so that your tax

788
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,240
form fits on a beer stamp uh but this

789
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,839
never happened if I would show you the

790
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,720
tax forms and literally every single

791
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,920
German has to do their tax form every

792
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,119
year and it's a science literally uh it

793
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:54,000
takes you about a day just because of

794
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,200
how complicated it is and uh how to say

795
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,440
in Germany you tell your employer your

796
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,119
envision ient gross

797
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,160
salary but that doesn't mean that that

798
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,160
is your net salary so what is

799
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,480
transferred to you on your bank account

800
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,400
is about half of that and depending on

801
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,160
which tax bracket you are and whether

802
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,560
you're single married have children or

803
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,319
more it could be a bit more than half a

804
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,160
bit less than half the problem is that

805
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:25,359
this one already creates the first level

806
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,400
where people feel treated very very

807
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,359
unfairly because in Germany you have two

808
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
levels of tax one is the tax that you

809
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,280
pay as an employee and the other is the

810
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,760
level of tax that the employer pays and

811
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,960
I like to say I run a business I charge

812
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:48,599
my customer â¬100 from those â¬ 100 I as a

813
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,680
private person can spend about 30 the

814
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,000
rest goes to the government in one form

815
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,760
or another so as an employer I always

816
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,640
see the â¬ 100 EUR that I need to make in

817
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,079
order to pay

818
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,319
myself as an employee there â¬0 as an

819
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,520
employee and there was even one comedian

820
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,520
in Germany who made this joke that he

821
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,079
said that it's a bit schizophrenic

822
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,760
running a oneperson company as an

823
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,160
employer you say my employees they're

824
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,640
asking too much money and as an employee

825
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,000
you say my employer is ripping me

826
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:27,520
off but but I think I think um Michael

827
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,880
by default if you're just an employ

828
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,839
employee in Germany and you have no

829
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,119
special

830
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:39,400
circumstances the company does your tax

831
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,960
return no correct no no they file of

832
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,040
course they legally have to do but you

833
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,599
still have to take care of your tax

834
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,880
returns by yourself the company's not

835
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,160
involved in this

836
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,599
process okay that's that's not the

837
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,119
information I have over here it just

838
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,760
says that um you may may want to file

839
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,599
tax returns but you don't have to um so

840
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,040
in in the UK I can file as an employee I

841
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,520
can file a tax return if I want to but

842
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,079
by default unless if I'm only working

843
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,560
for one company

844
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:13,200
Ryan if I only have one

845
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:17,079
employer then they know everything about

846
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,480
my incoming finances so unless I have

847
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,400
any other things that I need to declare

848
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,280
I can just let the company file my my

849
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,720
tax returns on my behalf and that's a

850
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,720
legal obligation of theirs uh Within in

851
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,040
the UK so they play pay the employees

852
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,319
tax what's actually really interesting

853
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,640
is companies shield from employees that

854
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,880
other piece that Michael's talking about

855
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:42,400
because you have the cost of the

856
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,720
employee right from the perspective of

857
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,640
the employee like I know I get paid x

858
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,760
amount and my tax is this amount but

859
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,760
what you don't see is the employer's

860
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,079
liability

861
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,720
tax workers compensation and federal

862
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,520
programs and all that stuff that we have

863
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,960
here and even even like we we pay

864
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,119
something called national insurance

865
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,119
which is like Social Security in the US

866
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,920
which used to be for a specific thing

867
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:12,839
and now it's just tax right um and and

868
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,760
there's employer employees contributions

869
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,160
and employers contributions and the

870
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,800
employer contributions is higher so

871
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:23,200
staff don't normally see or even under

872
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,720
staff employees not business owners just

873
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,240
pure employees don't normally have any

874
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:34,359
visibility on what they actually cost

875
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:37,119
the business exactly and and yeah that's

876
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:40,160
weird well I think this comes down to a

877
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,560
basic so we're talking about individual

878
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,440
incentivization right and I think this

879
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,880
and Michael you brought Alfie con into

880
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,839
the into the conversation with that too

881
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,280
and and Alfie as as you know and Martin

882
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,920
I think you know this too from from

883
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,520
where we've been talking about in beta

884
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,520
codex and all that stuff is that um

885
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,040
incentives are individual incentives are

886
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,599
demotivating the punished by rewards

887
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,400
kind of thingum and that and and

888
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,880
iemp pardon employee of of the month is

889
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,640
one of my favorite ones yeah well and

890
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,440
this I think we're coming down to this

891
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,680
okay so my individual tax burden is this

892
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
what do I what am I contributing to that

893
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,800
that all that

894
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,760
conversation becomes null and void when

895
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,839
a small group of employees in this area

896
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,839
are managing a business in and of

897
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,640
themselves with their own profit and

898
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,520
loss statement they're managing that

899
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,040
again different it's a different

900
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,880
relationship in kind in terms of oh it

901
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,720
doesn't necessarily matter you know what

902
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,920
what all of us no no one person creates

903
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,079
value on their own and I think that that

904
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,319
is a big concept because I need both of

905
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,839
you to create value in whatever I'm

906
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,680
doing

907
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,680
and on the variable compensation is top

908
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,680
of that but if if you raise and then

909
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,520
I'll I'll leave there but the

910
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,280
Baseline base compensation if you pay

911
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,400
people fairly and pay them well yeah

912
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,960
then then that quote I think this is a

913
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Deming quote I think that that is

914
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,520
actually I was trying to find it my

915
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,839
Deming I'm not 100% sure but I'm yeah I

916
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,440
think so it I think I think it's it's

917
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:23,319
really interesting though Ryan that

918
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,560
that the and suddenly we're we're

919
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,520
starting to have a conversation just

920
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,319
about capitalism right um the

921
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,920
the the big the elephant in the room

922
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:37,079
right in in the the the the the system

923
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,560
within which we

924
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,680
operate that we're all

925
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:45,520
operating is fundamentally about a small

926
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,040
group of people Gathering large amounts

927
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:53,240
of wealth right because the the the the

928
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,839
wealth flows from the people who don't

929
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,640
get paid very much but we make a lot of

930
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,400
profit on the people that are not and

931
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,800
rather than paying them

932
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,839
better the wealth flows up to that one

933
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,240
one person at the top right the CEO with

934
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,839
the multi-million dollar salary for

935
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,119
whatever reason but they're taking a lot

936
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,200
of risk but are they really taking

937
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,240
hundred million dollar worth of risk

938
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,040
right personal risk not really right and

939
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,760
and I think that's that idea that we

940
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,880
were kind of the employer employee

941
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:31,040
relationship if every person in in the

942
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,800
story would their own boss right You'

943
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,920
basically got a they're a bunch of

944
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,079
Boutique uh uh individuals who are

945
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,079
selling themselves for how much they

946
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,960
think they're worth and doing their own

947
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:44,200
taxes and doing their own thing and

948
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,200
understanding at that part of the

949
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,160
business like you're saying Ryan doing

950
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,200
profit and loss for that part of the

951
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,880
business yeah I think the reason we

952
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,040
don't have that

953
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,079
systemically is because those people

954
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:04,000
would be absolutely a

955
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,000
gas at the levels of profit that they

956
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,400
generate that's money that's going

957
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,760
somewhere else that they don't get right

958
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,359
exactly behen to the business to hide

959
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,920
that it's not really hide it's a virtual

960
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,920
hide make it make it um what's

961
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,920
the

962
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,000
through ASA as they can

963
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,040
so that employees don't get upset that

964
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,599
why am I doing this work and making you

965
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,280
100 million when you're only paying me

966
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,760
50 Grand right and and and again it's

967
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,640
not like like each individual oh I need

968
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:44,440
to have you know 98% of that you know

969
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,520
our team makes X and I need that I think

970
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,680
and this is part capitalism is not evil

971
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,720
capitalism what we have creating value

972
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,240
is not evil you know I I think there's

973
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,119
there's there's this bifurcation wow

974
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,760
okay right so there's this bifurcation

975
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,440
of oh it has to be way or the other

976
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,280
either we're this socialist dippy commun

977
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,839
folks but but some some folks bring it

978
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,480
but yeah I agree I agree with that there

979
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,119
there's a way to

980
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,720
say

981
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,280
individual the nordics are are are

982
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:19,680
fairly fairly good at creating that um

983
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,800
bif bifurcation where you you you've got

984
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,640
and the America you America used what

985
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,599
was the

986
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:31,520
1970s under a uh Republican government

987
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:34,559
what was the tax Max tax bracket I think

988
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,760
it was 70% yeah there was 75% tax

989
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,119
bracket I think there was a 90% D

990
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,280
bracket back in the in the FDR days the

991
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:44,680
the the we had we had a thing in the UK

992
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,119
that was it was really interesting had a

993
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,920
really interesting effect at one point I

994
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,800
think it was in the 80s or early 90s I

995
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,319
can't 100% remember so somebody would

996
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,640
need to look it up and and validate it

997
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,000
but we had a whole bunch bunch of

998
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,119
companies that were making unbelievably

999
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,920
ridiculous amounts of profit and they

1000
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:08,839
were doing Revenue extraction not value

1001
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,240
creation they were extracting massive

1002
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:14,040
amounts of revenue from from effectively

1003
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,599
from the economy and it was damaging the

1004
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,599
entire economy the amount of money they

1005
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,079
were taking out and taking overseas and

1006
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,920
doing all of those kind of things so

1007
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,720
they created something I can't remember

1008
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,400
which government it was probably a labor

1009
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,720
government because it sounds not like

1010
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,599
something the conservatives here would

1011
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,480
do

1012
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,839
um but they created something called the

1013
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:37,720
winfall tax and the windfall tax said if

1014
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:42,359
your business makes over 500 million in

1015
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:45,839
profit everything over that is 100% tax

1016
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:48,640
that was the wind tax and it forced all

1017
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,359
of these companies to start going we

1018
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,280
don't want to pay the tax so what should

1019
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,520
we do with this money instead perhaps we

1020
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,400
should invest it in our infrastructure

1021
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,040
perhaps we should invest it in our

1022
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,079
people perhaps we should invest it in

1023
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,240
the things that we're doing to generate

1024
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:08,319
value within our context and encouraged

1025
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,480
people to do that and I I thought it was

1026
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:13,319
a it was a I'm not saying that would

1027
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,839
work now but it was a very interesting

1028
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:18,599
Dynamic that happened as part of that

1029
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,559
that that story and very very

1030
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,720
interesting in terms of regulatory

1031
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:25,160
impact of that well now we have that

1032
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,040
regulation then then the folks who who

1033
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,800
have been

1034
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,680
get in the ill gotten gain from before

1035
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:37,240
that regulation might hire uh capable

1036
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,240
and intelligent tax accountants to say

1037
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,480
how might we Shield that profit and put

1038
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,960
it somewhere else else I mean and that's

1039
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,119
and we've we've

1040
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,119
we right endend up with with with with a

1041
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,880
lot of whack-a-mole because you don't

1042
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,040
have this problem in in in the US Ryan

1043
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,040
but we we've got we've got a thousand

1044
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,440
plus year old tax system in Europe for

1045
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:01,680
most of the most of the the the the

1046
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:06,280
countries so there's all kinds of weird

1047
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,920
stuff in European law and and European

1048
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,400
just in in the countries right in the

1049
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,280
tax law and the things that that are

1050
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,480
very hard to close because they've just

1051
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,160
been there for so long and nobody's the

1052
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,200
things have superseded them but then

1053
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,640
they find this way of loop hauling

1054
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,599
something I I know you have that in the

1055
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,559
states as well but when you've got a

1056
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,599
thousand years of tax law it's worse 250

1057
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:31,800
is different than than a thousand or

1058
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,440
more Michael I think you you're going to

1059
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,079
hop in there um in a moment or I don't

1060
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:40,720
know if that's no it's okay but

1061
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,800
if I mean the entire conversation about

1062
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,800
tax is very interesting because it

1063
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:51,720
somehow closes the loop between uh the

1064
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:55,599
economy as the global system the company

1065
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,960
as how to say our system of work and me

1066
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,880
as an individual with even how to say my

1067
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,520
family my close Circle as my

1068
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,680
personal system of control I would say

1069
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:11,400
uh but how to say I would say one of the

1070
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,400
key issues when we talking about those

1071
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,680
is

1072
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,079
even the system that we are operating in

1073
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,240
we can always uh reframe it and we just

1074
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,200
reframed it by saying let's talk about

1075
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,920
text let's talk about capitalism as a

1076
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,559
whole uh and even this uh when we bring

1077
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,839
this one back to the point where we are

1078
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,559
coming from is what kind of decisions do

1079
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:38,680
we want whom to make because uh what we

1080
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,559
were talking about Martin with this one

1081
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,640
the 500 million the windfall tax is uh

1082
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,280
literally the big decisions made by some

1083
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,760
of the big corporate players which is

1084
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,760
yeah yeah yeah that's really high 1% of

1085
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,040
the

1086
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:57,880
population and uh I to say the what we

1087
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:01,079
need to talk about and that is why I was

1088
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,960
bringing up the entire point is uh and I

1089
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:06,720
think that is fully within the spirit of

1090
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,680
anything that any one of us is promoting

1091
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,640
I would like uh all those kind of

1092
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,160
decisions to be more decentralized to

1093
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,359
have everybody involved in the decision

1094
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,960
everybody being able to talk at face

1095
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,839
level rather than I am on the top that's

1096
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,680
why I'm telling you and then you tell

1097
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,319
your people and then they tell their

1098
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,280
people face level conversations are the

1099
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:32,480
way that we can change this system so

1100
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,599
what we need to create is a system not

1101
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,240
only where the phase level conversation

1102
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:39,599
is possible but where people do have a

1103
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,520
self-interested in saying I want to join

1104
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,440
this

1105
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,799
conversation yep and Ryan has a lovely

1106
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,680
diagram behind him behind his head right

1107
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:50,319
there uh uh getting to some of some of

1108
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,839
those some of those ideas it doesn't

1109
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,839
have all the answers but it definitely

1110
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,880
is a is a definitely a a a structure

1111
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,599
that can be

1112
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,520
I I I think you're you're absolutely

1113
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,040
right but I think it only comes with the

1114
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,079
that that's that idea of the sale based

1115
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,200
structure of the profit and loss at each

1116
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,319
level that that we just don't

1117
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,920
fundamentally have now I I worked with a

1118
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:15,280
company in

1119
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,680
Norway and uh it's a French company but

1120
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,960
I worked with the the Norwegian

1121
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:23,079
department and they had a product that

1122
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,319
cost a lot of money to make 650 people

1123
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:30,400
working on it every day and the product

1124
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:32,480
owner for that product had no visibility

1125
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,640
of how much that product cost to

1126
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,079
build none none at all so the way I know

1127
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,200
exactly the way the way it was organized

1128
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,960
was that that there was I think it was H

1129
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,839
nine 13 Technology Centers in nine

1130
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,760
different countries and each Technology

1131
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,839
Center invested their own money in

1132
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,200
features for the

1133
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:58,960
product so profit and loss was all

1134
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:02,079
country based in these nine different

1135
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,200
countries and the product owner and

1136
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,280
management for the product had zero

1137
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,000
visibility on because they they're not

1138
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,160
allowed to see the profit and loss for

1139
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,680
the division in this other country

1140
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:16,079
that's not allowed within the context of

1141
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:19,359
this big hierarchical oil and gas

1142
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,480
business right and and but that

1143
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:24,440
fundamental lack of visitability is part

1144
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,240
of the problem yes and it's not but it's

1145
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,680
not it's not I think we're losing sight

1146
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,920
of the big picture though because it's

1147
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,880
not just money that's the problem I mean

1148
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,839
we're talking about money in the context

1149
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,280
here is money but I worked with a car

1150
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,880
company and they couldn't get in order

1151
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:44,640
to get Telemetry data from all of the

1152
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,240
cars in existence right to get access to

1153
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,760
some of the tele data it took six to

1154
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,960
eight months of request forms and

1155
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,400
getting the data and the person I was

1156
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,720
speaking to had colleagues in Tesla who

1157
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,720
could just go

1158
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,799
the data right and then we can make

1159
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,119
decisions based on what's actually

1160
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:06,799
happening out in the world now did now

1161
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,240
in that example did they have a have

1162
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:11,319
visibility understanding of why Tesla

1163
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,720
was functioning that way and what was it

1164
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:16,960
about that organization

1165
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,319
different I I kind of know what it is

1166
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,520
but I what was

1167
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,599
the I

1168
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:26,599
mean I think Tesla is a funny Beast that

1169
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,359
doesn't fit into any particular category

1170
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:31,520
because and I think all of elon's

1171
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:34,760
companies are the same right that the

1172
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,480
the there and probably Apple was the

1173
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,839
same under under jobs right there's a

1174
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,559
little bit of cult of personality

1175
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:46,359
driving the decision making rather than

1176
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:48,680
policy based decision- making which is

1177
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:51,319
how most organizations and I say most

1178
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,640
Ryan for sure most organization what

1179
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:55,880
what could you tell me what you think

1180
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,440
well what I I think I don't know whether

1181
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,160
this came from from a a talk I saw with

1182
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,559
Joe Justice because I know he had been

1183
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,720
involved there in

1184
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,839
some some background knowledge but what

1185
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,720
I understand is that they kind of have

1186
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:12,119
apis between their different teams that

1187
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,839
there are agreements of how this team

1188
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,520
deals with that team and that team deals

1189
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,599
with the other teams and those are not

1190
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,480
mandated and that if if I have a a Rules

1191
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:22,920
of Engagement for myself as it were and

1192
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,599
you have it for yourself and we serve

1193
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,680
these different needs that that

1194
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,040
information can flow much more freely

1195
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,319
because we have that kind of

1196
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,359
relationship I think that that also may

1197
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:35,359
be true of the actual Hardware of the

1198
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:37,040
vehicles um and that how that is

1199
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,520
assembled that we we can assemble

1200
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,480
different parts in different ways but if

1201
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:44,680
our if our protocol if our interaction

1202
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,799
Protocols are if we have a good

1203
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,559
understanding of the interaction

1204
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:50,119
protocols then we will have have the

1205
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,160
ability to get information back and

1206
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,280
forth effectively without having to

1207
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,559
translate and make legible why we are

1208
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,400
doing what we're doing in order to

1209
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:01,000
satisfy some need for status level

1210
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,599
control and as opposed to to going based

1211
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,480
on value

1212
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,760
creation but I think um Nils talked

1213
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,520
about this a little bit in when we did

1214
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,920
the the the master class he talked about

1215
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,200
um maybe it wasn't Nils maybe it was

1216
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,280
because I was speaking to somebody else

1217
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:22,400
about um not

1218
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:25,839
uh not ah I'm trying to get my brain in

1219
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,880
gear um they were talking about you you

1220
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,119
need to have a sponsor for whatever

1221
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,760
changes you're making in the

1222
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,760
organization if you want to make those

1223
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:35,559
types of changes you need a sponsor

1224
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,920
that's senior enough yeah it it was I

1225
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,680
don't think it was Nils it was open

1226
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,119
space beta it was um open space agile it

1227
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,599
was the open space agile D isic open

1228
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,880
space that's that's I speaking to um and

1229
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:51,440
he he he was talking

1230
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,760
about the hard part is getting people

1231
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,880
somebody senior enough and I I like I

1232
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,599
like Neil's comment that if you're

1233
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,559
talking to somebody and they're like oh

1234
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,319
I've got to go ask somebody you're not

1235
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:07,480
talking to somebody senior enough right

1236
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:10,760
but the difficulty in doing doing that

1237
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,480
with smaller organizations is

1238
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,240
easy doing that with large organizations

1239
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:19,599
was hard I I when I worked at Marl Lynch

1240
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:23,319
my boss was a project

1241
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,119
manager his boss was a regional director

1242
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,200
a business Regional

1243
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,680
director and there were living people

1244
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:35,160
above

1245
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:38,559
him yeah so how like at some point in an

1246
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,760
organization like that management is

1247
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,720
effectively Bean counting right there's

1248
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,480
not there's not actually any

1249
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,520
understanding of the work being done we

1250
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,240
don't care about the work being done

1251
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,480
it's numbers and spreadsheets and profit

1252
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,119
and that's all we care about yeah and

1253
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,920
management by remote

1254
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,400
control there was I had a great I'm so

1255
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,680
I'm thr in a lot of things but I had a

1256
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,119
great conversation with somebody at a

1257
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,960
conference years

1258
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:06,000
ago who he asked me what I did and I

1259
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,280
said I help organizations that are

1260
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,039
screwed get unscrewed right that's

1261
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,039
effectively well that's that's what

1262
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:15,599
that's what we do right right yeah um

1263
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:18,119
and he said

1264
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:21,039
why and I said I don't know he said you

1265
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:24,440
should just let them die go go find a

1266
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:27,359
company that's not like that and make it

1267
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,760
successful and ignore the companies that

1268
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,599
are that are have that because they're

1269
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,400
not they're not fundamentally going to

1270
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,200
change it does feel a lot Ryan like

1271
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,480
we're what's it h peeing up wind I think

1272
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,079
is the expression peeing into the wind

1273
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,960
right yeah a chotic or someone say quick

1274
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,039
sotic Quest you know you're tilting at

1275
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:53,440
windmills kind of yeah it's it's just so

1276
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:54,680
hard to actually help people to actually

1277
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,799
make change in

1278
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,599
organization is it wor worth actually

1279
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:01,960
making the change and then with with the

1280
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,200
effort and then I think about

1281
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:08,960
organizations like Microsoft right that

1282
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:12,280
while certainly not awesome on on these

1283
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,760
things has made massive changes in the

1284
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,960
fundamental way they do business over

1285
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,640
the last 10 years that has enabled them

1286
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,000
to take advantage of many of the things

1287
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,200
that that that we talk about not all of

1288
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,240
the things that they still they're still

1289
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,319
a big hierarchal organization right how

1290
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,480
many 50,000 150,000 I'm trying to think

1291
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,920
how many people in how many people you

1292
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,880
need uh two in front of that and an

1293
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,799
extra zero yeah there two

1294
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,240
200,000 200,000 people in in in in

1295
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:45,839
Microsoft but if you think about it as a

1296
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,799
group of businesses which is why Google

1297
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,160
changed right that's what one one this

1298
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:53,760
is my I'm not saying it's why Google

1299
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,880
changed it's why I think Google changed

1300
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,440
right that they changed to a venture

1301
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,920
capit

1302
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,680
company alphabet because they realize

1303
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,240
that you just can't change its scale and

1304
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,799
what's better is you kill the old

1305
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,720
companies and start new

1306
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:13,520
companies um start new efforts kill old

1307
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,359
efforts right um and yeah it's a

1308
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,280
decentralizing

1309
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:21,240
pattern but it's it's kind of like big

1310
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,359
kind of moving solar systems out of the

1311
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,960
Galaxy instead of you know moving

1312
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,880
planets to different parts of the solar

1313
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,039
system kind of thing um so and maybe

1314
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,480
this is about the Arc of History you

1315
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:37,640
know if we if we each as individuals we

1316
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,240
are where we are when we are there um

1317
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:46,880
working and living within a Microsoft

1318
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:49,319
mirror Lynch a IBM or name your Behemoth

1319
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,319
and are are you choosing to be a force

1320
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:56,160
for Force for good or Force for evil but

1321
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,880
a force for um changing the system and

1322
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,839
intervening in the system and standing

1323
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:06,440
up for something that that there is a

1324
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:09,720
there is a way that we could be we and

1325
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,799
and do more and be more and not only

1326
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,880
just only for the employees and like ha

1327
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:15,440
human relations you know big deal make

1328
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,359
the employees feel happy and then still

1329
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:21,039
extract the universe but to actually

1330
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:22,839
have people in relationship one another

1331
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,640
and relationship with the customer in

1332
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:28,440
service of a greater good for the

1333
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,400
company and for the society because I

1334
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,799
mean I think we we got in from

1335
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,240
individual versus team and then we also

1336
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,799
when we started talking about taxes

1337
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:41,359
you're talking about wow what is our

1338
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:44,400
responsibility as individuals also to to

1339
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:47,599
the the legal and government struction

1340
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:51,039
around us isn't what we're talking about

1341
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:54,039
here very similar to a

1342
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,039
Cooperative

1343
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,000
similar it's kind of a new new kind of

1344
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,160
Beast I think I think we have to think

1345
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,079
of some new kind of animal because

1346
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,039
because the the language around around

1347
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,839
what we're talking about becomes oh are

1348
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:10,640
you talking about this are you talking

1349
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:14,000
about that I know I know there's a new

1350
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:16,319
type of company that they've just I I

1351
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,079
created a new type of company in the US

1352
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:22,359
like an official you can put it on the

1353
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:25,119
form company it's a a low profit a low

1354
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:26,520
profit company yeah I think those be B

1355
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,720
Corps

1356
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:32,760
yeah I I don't know the exact

1357
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:35,440
terminology um and and I I I think I

1358
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,079
think it's really it's really

1359
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,520
interesting

1360
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,400
and I think it's the future but how

1361
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,359
quickly do we get there I think it's

1362
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,920
going to be really really difficult

1363
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,880
because we still we still have I mean

1364
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,960
existentially we still have to get over

1365
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:59,119
the um Universal income hump as well

1366
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:02,640
which is we've not got it yet uh it's

1367
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,640
it's going to be a really

1368
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:08,200
interesting

1369
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,920
decade I think yeah well and I think and

1370
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,720
this is this is all we're not talking

1371
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,839
about I mean there's there's there's

1372
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:16,440
ways to think about this that are not

1373
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:18,960
either or that are better you know it's

1374
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,119
not Universal basic income which is like

1375
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,680
everybody everybody gets this and no one

1376
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:27,559
get and more and there's no no variable

1377
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,640
compensation but I think the idea of

1378
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:31,160
variable and and hey we're talking about

1379
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,760
money so we can talk about compensation

1380
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,160
I think compensation and motivation was

1381
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,440
one of the things we were again with

1382
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:40,119
talk about Dan pink you're bringing that

1383
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,119
in there but so if we are if I trust you

1384
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:46,559
if I respect you and we're do we're in

1385
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:49,680
we're in this love together and if we're

1386
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:52,039
there with it um then we can talk about

1387
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,160
compensation what is what what are our

1388
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:55,680
relative

1389
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,640
compensation what is our contribution to

1390
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,680
this group each other and you can't have

1391
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,319
that in a 50 person

1392
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,599
organization among 50 people but you can

1393
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:08,160
have it among five to seven or eight

1394
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,799
yeah and and so so that I think that

1395
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,000
it's it's a different model of

1396
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:14,480
compensation and and financial

1397
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,720
management that that you have to be

1398
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,599
willing to suspend your disbelief and

1399
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,880
have someone and have dialogue with

1400
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,000
someone who has sponsorship authority to

1401
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,039
make the kind of change that we're

1402
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,279
talking difficult to get enough snowball

1403
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:30,039
to make

1404
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:32,880
the these sorts of things viable because

1405
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:37,559
the the the where all the all the money

1406
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:39,200
is is in these big biomic organizations

1407
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,880
and these big bomic

1408
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,079
organizations um don't want to deal with

1409
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,359
the seven or eight person company

1410
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,079
because then oh crap I'm going to have

1411
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:50,839
to um if if if we have a thousand seven

1412
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:52,480
or eight company companies we've got to

1413
01:02:50,839 --> 01:02:55,119
deal with I've got to do a thousand

1414
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,880
invoices a month but if I go to

1415
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:00,279
Accenture I only have one invoice a

1416
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,039
month I'm done right and the the there's

1417
01:03:00,279 --> 01:03:06,920
a there's a uh how would you describe it

1418
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:10,039
there's a a a local

1419
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,039
optimization um where they want to

1420
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:15,319
minimize their invoicing

1421
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:17,520
costs that is really that's a tactical

1422
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:20,799
problem though

1423
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,000
that's Sol it's a problem but they a

1424
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,359
strategic initiative right it is

1425
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,480
extremely relevant

1426
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:30,720
and even though it might be disclosing a

1427
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,480
bit too much of some confidential stuff

1428
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,520
that's going on on my end but this is

1429
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,039
exactly some of the stuff that we are

1430
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:41,480
doing we are operating with some of the

1431
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:44,240
world's best players in their field and

1432
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:46,960
let's just say I don't want to name uh

1433
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,079
any big Consulting but those people do

1434
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,079
not work for big Consulting they have

1435
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:56,119
their own business so if you want them

1436
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:58,960
all together you do not have a choice

1437
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:01,160
you have to go saying that where do we

1438
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,319
find the right

1439
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,799
people I think there's two there's two

1440
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:07,279
different sorts of

1441
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:09,039
Consulting right and and and I'm I'm

1442
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:11,400
definitely polarizing here putting

1443
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,480
things in buckets which I fully fully

1444
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,599
fully admit I'm happy to do right

1445
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,680
polarizing always fun right there's two

1446
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,160
types of people in the world those that

1447
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,640
understand binary right

1448
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,440
SC so there's but I I feel like there's

1449
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:28,000
two main types of Consulting

1450
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,319
there the big

1451
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:36,119
Consulting um like the the the the the

1452
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:40,480
accent and infosis and uh I don't know

1453
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:42,359
pick pick your McKenzie

1454
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,000
deoe you know a lot of people don't

1455
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:46,319
realize how long McKenzie's been around

1456
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,760
right I think they're they're coming up

1457
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:50,760
on their on their

1458
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:55,039
centinary um and and and the Damage

1459
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:58,640
they've done I really recommend um uh oh

1460
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:00,640
what's the book called the big con big

1461
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:05,319
con yeah that one that one awesome

1462
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,319
Marana matado yes yeah um those those

1463
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:11,039
types of

1464
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:13,559
Consultants tend to be about fulfilling

1465
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,839
consultancy like consultancy is the

1466
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:19,799
point we want to take over parts of your

1467
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:21,720
business and we will run it for you

1468
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:24,119
because it's more efficient for more

1469
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,760
cost effective for us to run it because

1470
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:29,520
we've got a 100 people in a room that

1471
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:33,680
can do your invoicing for you right um

1472
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:37,039
but the reality is that Outsourcing

1473
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:40,440
those things results in a company's

1474
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,359
inability to adapt to change because

1475
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:45,520
they're relying to pick on upon this

1476
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:49,480
other system I my favorite example is

1477
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:52,480
anything to do with sap right as soon as

1478
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,279
you bring in sap or

1479
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,839
I let's let's let's double down in

1480
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:59,520
Microsoft moft uh Microsoft's got a sap

1481
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,559
compete whatever the heck it's called

1482
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,000
Great

1483
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,200
Planes no it's not called that anymore

1484
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,720
but yeah it was called grip planes um as

1485
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,240
soon as you you bring in somebody else's

1486
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,640
business model that you have to follow

1487
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:16,960
you're limiting your ability to change

1488
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:19,880
it it doesn't matter what it is right

1489
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,760
sometimes we accept small limitations

1490
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,119
like we might use as your devops to hold

1491
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:29,520
our work items or we might use jira or

1492
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:31,960
we might use that's a small um dis

1493
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:34,680
what's the opposite of optimization un

1494
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,960
optimization dis

1495
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:40,559
optimization whatever that compromise

1496
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:43,160
it's just a compromise yeah we we we we

1497
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,920
compr you're right we compromise our

1498
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:48,079
ability to change a little bit in order

1499
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,359
to streamline something and when you do

1500
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,640
it at the small scale like we're going

1501
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:55,079
to store our work items in aure

1502
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:58,200
devops awesome pretty pretty high

1503
01:06:55,079 --> 01:07:00,960
benefit for pretty low uh uh limitation

1504
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:04,200
right until it's not and then you change

1505
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:06,920
but when it's something as systemic as

1506
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,760
our entire procurement

1507
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,039
platform that goes to every part of the

1508
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,000
business it then makes it really

1509
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:16,000
difficult to change because any change

1510
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,839
is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

1511
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,359
millions of dollars to get it to change

1512
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:24,160
we we we

1513
01:07:20,359 --> 01:07:26,559
we it's an optimization that creates

1514
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:30,920
this inability to change

1515
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:34,279
right yeah a friend of mine said one

1516
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:36,760
time that uh he hates uh let's not name

1517
01:07:34,279 --> 01:07:39,720
the company this one with a passion

1518
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:43,279
because he said that once you bring them

1519
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,760
on board it's easier to kill your

1520
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:47,200
business and start a new company than to

1521
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,760
get rid of them

1522
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:54,839
again yeah I think that's but I I count

1523
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,520
the big consultancies and big software

1524
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,839
in that

1525
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,440
and I guess there's software that maybe

1526
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:04,039
doesn't count in that category like

1527
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,440
bringing do doing Office 365 or Google

1528
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:08,559
probably doesn't because it doesn't

1529
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,760
impose process on you yeah right it just

1530
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:14,839
provides capability you can decide how

1531
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:18,000
you use it but I it's where you cross

1532
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:20,920
that line

1533
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,319
into imposing upon your your your

1534
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:25,640
business

1535
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:28,159
practices actually in this one I think

1536
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,040
that one of the key challenges that com

1537
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:34,600
companies face is they buy these things

1538
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,799
as a commodity and don't realize that

1539
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,440
what they are onboarding is not a

1540
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:42,120
commodity but a business model yeah B

1541
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,319
they're bring and when you when you

1542
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,719
install somebody else's business model

1543
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,080
what makes you different from that

1544
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:52,239
somebody else and that's exactly you L

1545
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:54,319
differentiating factor and uh I remember

1546
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:56,960
working many years ago with a Telco

1547
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,640
operator who said at literally I mean

1548
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,520
you as a customer you take your phone in

1549
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,400
the end does it matter for you you go to

1550
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,480
AT&T you go to T-Mobile you go to Dell

1551
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,679
whatever it doesn't matter to you so

1552
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:10,920
what's the discriminating factor for you

1553
01:09:08,679 --> 01:09:13,400
as a customer the price teag what

1554
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,159
defines the price de process efficiency

1555
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,920
but if all three of them have the same

1556
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:21,000
process how's that supposed to

1557
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:25,520
work so to bring this all the way back

1558
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,799
to our original question right that that

1559
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,600
sh the should companies take money off

1560
01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:34,920
the table and understanding the cost

1561
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:39,839
it's not just the employes not

1562
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:43,719
understanding the cost of um what their

1563
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:45,120
cost to doing the work it's everybody

1564
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:47,279
who's a decision maker in the

1565
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:52,199
organization understanding the cost of

1566
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:56,280
doing not doing a thing and also the

1567
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:58,159
longterm cost like if you in if you take

1568
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,480
sap and replace your procurement

1569
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:03,360
processes with with a sap

1570
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,480
equivalent what's the cost to change

1571
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,480
later if you decide you want to

1572
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:11,960
change and How likely is that cost of

1573
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:14,239
change to happen and I I think people

1574
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,640
don't make

1575
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:21,800
decisions with that level of

1576
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:24,280
foresight and why why don't they and and

1577
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,719
U so my opinion about why I agree I

1578
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,159
agree that those decisions are not made

1579
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:31,520
with that level of information I know

1580
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:33,920
why too why well yeah well yeah we all

1581
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,840
know why but yeah we might not agree but

1582
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,159
again if if you take U

1583
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:42,880
obscurity off the table what do you have

1584
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:45,239
you have transparency and and if your

1585
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:48,679
open book all the information is there

1586
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:53,400
if the information is distributed in an

1587
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:55,360
effective and free fashion then then the

1588
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,400
then you can make the decisions and then

1589
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,120
you can agree and there there's there's

1590
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,920
certain frames about making group and

1591
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:05,159
group decision making is a whole other

1592
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:08,400
issue but I think add there's an

1593
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:12,480
additional piece on that Ryan and that's

1594
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,880
I I've been um there's a marketing guy

1595
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,560
who I've been watching a B I think he's

1596
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,440
actually a psychologist but he talks a

1597
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,760
lot at marketing forums but he's a

1598
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,560
psychologist and what he talks about

1599
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,920
is

1600
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,880
mathematics taking decision making off

1601
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,120
the table

1602
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:33,440
and they want people look at the cold

1603
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:36,520
hard numbers and make a decision based

1604
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:39,280
on the numbers because then they didn't

1605
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,679
have to make a decision the numbers made

1606
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,440
the decision for them oh God that's evil

1607
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:46,600
um and they don't have to take

1608
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,800
accountability for that decision because

1609
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,280
the numbers made that decision for them

1610
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,320
yeah and and that that goes into another

1611
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,840
whole and interesting it'd be

1612
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,199
interesting to hear who that person is

1613
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:59,440
and what the rational I thought and I

1614
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:01,320
thought as soon as you said Cold Hard

1615
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,520
Cash Michael's ears would perk up and he

1616
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,920
would she would show up on screen like

1617
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,560
oh my God I want to talk about the

1618
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,239
numbers

1619
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:13,440
um yes yeah that's you I'm talking to

1620
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:16,280
you it's inform decision making not do

1621
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,560
the decision making for you I I talk

1622
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,000
about I talk a lot about numbers and

1623
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,520
Telemetry and evidence-based management

1624
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,480
and all of those things but ultimately

1625
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:29,320
we're playing poker not chess right and

1626
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,159
we don't have all of the information we

1627
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,080
have some of the information and some of

1628
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:36,239
it's hidden and we're trying to use our

1629
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:39,199
intuition based on the data that we have

1630
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,600
to make the best decision possible

1631
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:41,920
within the context and then we see

1632
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,199
whether we're right maybe we need to

1633
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,120
make a different decision and yeah I'm

1634
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:50,760
I'm trying to get that um that guy for

1635
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,760
you because

1636
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:56,760
it's there he is there's something very

1637
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,600
similar I'm f

1638
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,800
uh and that is how to say I am part one

1639
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,520
of the startups I'm involved in is

1640
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:08,280
literally to make the

1641
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:12,560
information of an entire organization

1642
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:15,000
available and use a management framework

1643
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,120
to support decision making like you say

1644
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,480
I'm not taking the decisions away from

1645
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,520
people because I do not believe that

1646
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:23,639
mathematics can have the full

1647
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,800
understanding of what is going on but

1648
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:28,639
saying let's take all the data that you

1649
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,960
have how fast can you as a manager of

1650
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:33,080
10,000 people organization process

1651
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,639
everything that's going on you can't

1652
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:38,159
there's more happening in real time than

1653
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:41,080
you can catch up with but with AI you

1654
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:43,320
can catch up you can use algorithms you

1655
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:46,280
can use machine learning to figure out

1656
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:48,480
what's going on and say those are things

1657
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:51,880
that you have to pay attention to and

1658
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,560
that is noise and based on what we know

1659
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,679
what's going on those are decisions

1660
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,120
that are

1661
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:01,239
likely to bring you in the direction of

1662
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,800
the goals that you want to pursue and

1663
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:04,400
those things are the things that you

1664
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,120
have to address otherwise you're not

1665
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,400
going to reach your goal and I'm

1666
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:11,800
building this kind of thing with a team

1667
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,480
with AI and it's really fancy stuff but

1668
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,920
this is the organization that I want

1669
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:19,080
that everybody in the company has access

1670
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,520
to the information and decisions they

1671
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:25,360
need so that they can make them without

1672
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:27,840
meeting Madness

1673
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:30,199
well absolutely a and and I think the

1674
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,880
important thing is that this is a tool

1675
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:35,440
that's fit for purpose and that when

1676
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,320
when also this is I think this is

1677
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,159
another thing that Deming has said that

1678
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,800
if there are if there is fear involved

1679
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:46,239
in what the numbers are stating if

1680
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,000
there's people have fear of loss or this

1681
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:50,199
incentive to gain based on what numbers

1682
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,880
they are in individually responsible for

1683
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:54,840
reporting then those numbers are going

1684
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:57,800
to be lies they're just going to be lies

1685
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:59,800
and instead but I like the idea of okay

1686
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,440
the machines understand the numbers

1687
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:05,520
right if and if if the and again the

1688
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:08,199
algorithms and the calculations are also

1689
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,080
freely open and that that if you want to

1690
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:11,880
see how those decisions are made how

1691
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,120
those tabulations are done and what what

1692
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:16,800
what you're measuring if it can be

1693
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:19,199
measured and measured objectively and

1694
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,080
put out there for the actual carbon

1695
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,480
hydrogen oxygen and spirit beings to

1696
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,480
make sense of as opposed to the silicon

1697
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:30,400
and electricity beings um then then I

1698
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,480
think we can we can hold hands and talk

1699
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:36,400
about again like Martin like you're also

1700
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:39,440
saying is that making informed decisions

1701
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,920
and um making decisions quickly with

1702
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:47,080
with as good of information as we have

1703
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:49,800
actually I would say that one of the key

1704
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:52,360
challenges so have you have your turn

1705
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,040
soon one of the key challenges we face

1706
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:58,040
with decision making is that there's all

1707
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:01,760
always uncertainty so what we can only

1708
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:05,400
talk about is uh bets every business

1709
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:08,480
decision is a bet not a fact because we

1710
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,520
don't know until we tried it and

1711
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,400
probabilities but there are things that

1712
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:16,400
we know that most likely will not give

1713
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,719
you what you're looking for and things

1714
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,960
that are pretty likely to give you what

1715
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:24,400
you're looking for and there are

1716
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,880
patterns we've observed for many years

1717
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,159
uh and we can see if we can spot

1718
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,320
patterns and if we say that you're on

1719
01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:33,639
this pattern then we can say okay this

1720
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,159
is the kind of advice I would provide

1721
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:38,199
for you because literally as a

1722
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:39,760
consultant that's what I do I am uh

1723
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:41,159
trying to figure out what the patterns

1724
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,320
are that are going on in your

1725
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:46,560
organization I'm saying that okay based

1726
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:48,239
on what I've seen before this could work

1727
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,280
this is probably not going to work if

1728
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,960
it's you want to try it you can still

1729
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:55,560
try it it's your choice but let me make

1730
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,199
a prediction of the outcome and if

1731
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:00,080
you're good as a consultant then um I

1732
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:02,920
would say that at least two thirds of

1733
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:05,760
the time uh you're pretty on spot maybe

1734
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,960
not fully accurate but pretty on spot

1735
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,360
and this is the same that in many

1736
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:14,639
organizations is going wrong that uh

1737
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:17,600
most decisions are made without an

1738
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:19,000
understanding of where does this lead us

1739
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,639
it's just okay that we have this

1740
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,080
meetings we need to talk about this

1741
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:26,840
topic let's make the decision but what's

1742
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,840
going to happen nobody knows

1743
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,760
and again realizing that we're at time

1744
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,880
Martin I know I know you have to be out

1745
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,520
of here um a great conversation both

1746
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,679
both of you gentlemen Michael also want

1747
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,280
to bring you here to say some words

1748
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:41,880
Martin is there anything you wanted to

1749
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,760
say here bring forth that you had not

1750
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:47,400
yet had a chance to

1751
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:50,760
do no I think

1752
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:56,080
um that the the context is really

1753
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:58,600
important and don't Shield people from

1754
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,520
from that context in your organization

1755
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:05,600
for what is in effect selfish reasons

1756
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:08,000
right um I want to hide the information

1757
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,440
of how much the team costs because I

1758
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,920
don't want members of the team to find

1759
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,760
out they don't get paid very much that's

1760
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,719
a selfish reason um that's not a good

1761
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,320
reason to hide those costs and limit

1762
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:20,199
people's ability to make decisions and

1763
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:24,040
reduce the effectiveness of those

1764
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:25,560
decisions because I it's it's just not

1765
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:29,480
good enough

1766
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:32,440
but on the other side don't

1767
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:35,440
confuse Dan Pink's story of taking money

1768
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:38,520
off the table with that story of the

1769
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:42,360
corporate context the business

1770
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:44,760
context um the personal story of people

1771
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:50,960
who are

1772
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:53,960
individuals and want to be able to um

1773
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,280
make make the best they can of things

1774
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,520
that that that intrinsic focus on those

1775
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:01,920
intrinsic things of autonomy Mastery and

1776
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:04,159
purpose um and we want to enable that

1777
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,280
from the context of our business but

1778
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:08,639
don't

1779
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:11,159
compromise the context and knowledge and

1780
01:19:08,639 --> 01:19:14,760
understanding and transparency of your

1781
01:19:11,159 --> 01:19:18,920
business in order uh to support that

1782
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:21,520
right have both have both is what yeah

1783
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:24,800
show Nuance show Grace show respect

1784
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,320
sounds like human things um Michael

1785
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:30,639
would you like to drop in with your your

1786
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:33,560
final thoughts before we head

1787
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:36,440
out actually I can only say I fully

1788
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:39,600
agree with Martin and uh despite the

1789
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:42,040
seeming conflict this is exactly the

1790
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,000
point that I wanted to bring just uh

1791
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,719
have the conversation provide people an

1792
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,400
environment where they feel comfortable

1793
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:53,880
to have the right decisions to work in a

1794
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:56,840
way that is conducive both to them

1795
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:00,639
personally and to their business to

1796
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:04,280
their environment to society and if we

1797
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:07,440
can shape this in a way that everybody

1798
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:09,920
benefits then this is good for everybody

1799
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:13,320
but like you say don't for what is

1800
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,840
ultimately a selfish reason keep people

1801
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:18,600
away from things that maybe they should

1802
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,440
know because it's G to backfire you're

1803
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,600
not going to make the best decisions if

1804
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:25,600
people don't know what the consequences

1805
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
are

1806
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,719
well I will I will leave the uh leave

1807
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,920
the conversation at that thanks to both

1808
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:37,920
