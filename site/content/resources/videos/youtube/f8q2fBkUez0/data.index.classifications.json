Accountability is explicitly mentioned and tied to outcome ownership, especially in contexts like Scrum and examples such as Jaguar Land Rover's spending policy. However, the article's main focus is on financial literacy and its link to motivation, with accountability discussed mainly as an outcome rather than deeply explored as an organizational construct. The content aligns conceptually, but depth on explicit accountability systems, roles, or structural mechanisms is somewhat limited. The intended audience (leaders, Agile teams) matches the category, with a signal that's strong though some content is broader (motivation, financial literacy). No penalties applied; reasoning is supported by specific theme references and examples.",
