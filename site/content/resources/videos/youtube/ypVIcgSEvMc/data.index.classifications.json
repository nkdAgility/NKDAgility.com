Nowhere does it mention Product Developers, their responsibilities, or accountability. The main intent is marketing, not discussing product developer role, structure, or practices. While it uses language about professional growth and skill development, there is no alignment or depth on Product Developer as a formal accountability or role beyond generic references to learning or working in Agile/Scrum. The intended audience may include developers, but not specifically Product Developers in the modern sense. Signal-to-noise is low, as almost none of the content is relevant to the category.",

Audience is somewhat relevant, targeting practitioners in Agile and DevOps, but content is off-topic for the category.",
