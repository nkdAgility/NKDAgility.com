1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,559
I'm going to configure release

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,280
management to use um a a new uh Team

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,080
Foundation server so I'm going to go

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,039
ahead and open the release management

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,279
client I'm going to head over to the

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,400
administration

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,680
Tab and on here I've got a manage TFS

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,039
options let me go in there so you can

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,759
see we already have the Faber cam fiber

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,680
collection added I'm going to add the

11
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,719
tail spin toys one so if I click

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,760
new I can just put in the name of the

13
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:40,320
server here or I can put the full URL

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,480
you'll see that it kind of builds the

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,440
URL down at the bottom you can see at

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,239
the top as well I'm going to put the

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,600
collection name in which

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,559
is Tail

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,239
Spin

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,239
toys

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,960
collection and you'll see here I've got

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,519
the default path and port number and

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,120
this is just all on the default setup

24
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,480
and it's local to this box so I

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
shouldn't have any communication issues

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,520
however if I hit the verify button

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,479
you'll see I get a common error message

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
box pops up and this Box gives you

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
possible reasons for the communication

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,680
problem one is you you know you filled

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,360
it out correctly or the TFS server

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,360
unavailable and the other one is that

33
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,479
the password is incorrect which is the

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,880
case here I have no connect as account

35
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,920
name and password in um so I need to go

36
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,600
over here and I need to fill out

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,720
um

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,000
my user let me just check name there we

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,680
go and

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
my

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,240
password and click verify now if that

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,560
still doesn't work and you don't get a

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,520
green tick you might want to check uh

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,920
obvious things like the spelling of your

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,159
server and collection name and and

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
whether you can access those things the

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,520
easiest way to do that is to copy this

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,520
URL open it up in a browser paste it

49
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,000
in and see if you can actually access it

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,439
on that URL and indeed uh it can be much

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,920
easier to get access to it than just

52
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,239
copi it off and I can make it easier so

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,760
now that we have that I can hit save and

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:18,760
close and I now have two active uh uh

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
TFS

56
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,080
connections
