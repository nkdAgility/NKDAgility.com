It aligns well with Scrum principles, particularly in relation to accountability and value delivery. The depth of discussion is substantial, providing insights into backlog management techniques and the significance of team understanding. However, there is a brief mention of Kanban, which slightly detracts from the overall focus on Scrum.",
