1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,520
one of the key things that new product

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,559
owners need to learn is how to manage

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,280
their product back clog it's a key part

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,199
of the story yeah I will point out that

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,760
you don't necessarily need to do it

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,119
yourself right you can delegate it but

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,359
you remain accountable you you as the

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,480
product owner are accountable for Value

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,199
delivery and if maximizing the value

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,279
delivery and if you have a terrible

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,320
product backlog regardless of whether

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,280
you delegated or not still going to be

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,079
you that's held accountable right so you

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,920
at least especially if you're a new

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,800
product owner you're going to want to

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,320
learn how to manage a product backlog

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,640
how to order that backlog how to write a

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,680
good backlog so that you enable

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
understanding with everybody who's who

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,960
who needs to who's reading it um so in

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,640
order to do that uh it it does a lot of

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
work involved in managing a product

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
backlog one of the key Concepts that I

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,720
think is often overlooked by product

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,840
owners is that the the purpose of the

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,400
things in your backlog is they become

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,320
ready right I some the team can take

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,799
them

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,320
on based on everybody's understanding of

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,240
it you can't measure understanding right

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,079
you just can't measure it you can't say

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,640
here's a Line in the Sand and at this

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,040
point everybody understands it it's a

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,799
lot more nebulous than that a lot more

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,439
fuzzy than that so you as a product

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,280
owner need to learn to to read the room

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,320
to to to know what language you need to

38
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,840
use in order to enable understanding to

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,759
know what what sometimes people don't

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,640
want to admit that they don't understand

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,600
your thing right so you need to learn to

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,520
be able to read when when people are in

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,840
that category and and maybe do some more

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,280
around it but there are kind of um four

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
key vectors that you need to understand

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,720
you need to enable for your for your

47
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
product backlog the first one is risk

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,239
how risky are the things on your product

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,680
backlog and that could be fiscal risk it

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,360
could be operational risk um it could be

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,640
lots of different types of risk what's

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,000
the risk involved and if things are

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,640
really high risk those are the things

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,040
you want to spend a little bit more time

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,640
on upfront to understand them better

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,879
break them down reduce the risk right

57
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,239
that's that's that that's key that's

58
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,280
part of refinement right refining your

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,440
product backlog is really

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,159
important you also need to understand

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,599
the value what are you going to get out

62
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,280
of what do you think you're going to get

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,239
out of it because remember everything

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
you think you're going to get out of it

65
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,560
is an assumption until you actually get

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,280
it in front of real users who are using

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,360
it in production okay so you need to

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,840
figure out what's our what do we think

69
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,239
the value is going to be and does the

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,640
value we think we're going to get

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,319
actually outweigh the risk right if the

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,159
risk is too high for the value perhaps

73
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,480
we don't bother doing it it's too

74
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,239
dangerous it's too risky for our product

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,280
another thing to understand is the size

76
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,239
of the items on your backlog how big are

77
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,959
those things um that can I'm not going

78
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,959
to tell you how to determine what big is

79
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,040
but I generally have a conversation with

80
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,720
teams uh the people who are going to do

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,439
the work right are your one of your

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,599
primary audiences

83
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,760
do they feel that they understand it

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,519
enough that they can deliver it in a

85
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,519
single Sprint that might be a question

86
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,159
to ask if they do understand it enough

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
to deliver it in a single Sprint you're

88
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,799
probably good to go if they don't

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
understand it it could be either because

90
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,120
it's too big or because there's not

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
enough information or they don't they

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,079
need more questions answered to be able

93
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,599
to understand it a little bit more and

94
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,200
that's where refinement comes in so we

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,920
talked about risk value and size

96
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,159
and the last item is how we solve some

97
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,640
of those problems is learning right is

98
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,720
there something that you need to learn

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,519
uh by doing right remember agile

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,040
Manifesto we learn more by

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,079
doing so maybe you can do maybe you can

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,680
try and build something small maybe you

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,919
can um take on a little piece of that

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,160
risk early on and try and do something

105
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
in the

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,360
product that hopefully alleviate that

107
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,039
risk or at least you figure out more

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,759
about that risk that's product backlog

109
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,240
management you've got this overarching

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,240
refinement you need to refine this

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,280
backlog to ready and then everybody

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,160
needs to understand it so that the team

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,280
can deliver it and the stakeholders

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,600
understand the value because if they

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,400
don't understand the value they're not

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,560
going to turn up at the review right um

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,600
so how are you able to do that we have

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,160
uh scrum.org have the new um product

119
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,960
backlog manag M course which is

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,600
specifically focused on this topic that

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,520
takes you through a whole bunch of

122
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,520
complimentary practices that can help

123
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,240
you with that story uh but there's also

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,919
lots of different tools and techniques

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
that we talk about in the product owner

126
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,319
class the advanced product owner class

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,199
around that topic heck even the

128
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,360
professional scrum with user experience

129
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,600
brings in that refinement story and if

130
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,360
you really want to get serious then you

131
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,680
probably want to bring flow mechanics

132
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,400
into your story as in have a caman

133
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,960
strategy applied to whatever your

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,120
process is for delivering uh uh your

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,440
product and enable um the the the

136
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,560
maximum throughput in your process while

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,840
you're also focused on maximizing the

138
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,639
value and that's an awesome combination

139
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,759
right ability to deliver and delivering

140
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,479
the right thing that's how you make

141
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,199
awesome products if you find it hard to

142
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,840
manage your product backlog and maximize

143
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,880
the value that you're returning my team

144
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,960
at naked agility can help or we can help

145
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,759
you find somebody who can don't let

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,960
these sorts of issues undermine your

147
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,840
ability to deliver value don't have a

148
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,759
poor quality not understood product
