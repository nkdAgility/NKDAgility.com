00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,280
welcome to another episode of agile

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:10,880
actually today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,120
tools creating more of a problem than

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
they

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,600
solve what do you think Simon that looks

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,960
like it triggers you

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,400
already tools complicating the problem

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,240
uh I I love the quote from Grady bo uh a

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,039
fool with a tool is still a fool just

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,439
and then you got the coroller but now

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
they're a tooled up fool

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,160
um I think it's very easy to fall into

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:42,360
the tool trap I think this this is a

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,360
massive thing um how much do you

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,960
include

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,239
predefined packaged processes or

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,520
practices in in that word to as well

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,480
because I I kind of I kind of do right

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,039
if you if you

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,160
have is an interesting one yeah is is

21
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,799
Scrum

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,000
tool yeah that's a that I W that's a

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,560
good one it depends I guess it depends

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,960
on your perspective right scrum could be

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,960
a tool from one perspective it could be

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,840
a like a collection of tools that are

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,040
put together into a technology right I I

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,799
I I tend to think of scrum as a

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,240
technology rather than specifically as a

30
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,400
tool but you could that there's some

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,840
synonymous nature between those two

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,799
terminologies right yeah words are fun

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:38,560
right yeah but but for story points is a

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,880
tool Yeah well yeah so it's a yeah uh a

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,320
device or implement used to carry out a

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,040
particular

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,640
function yeah all right so if we say

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
that's what a tool is I I really like

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,600
the fact that Ken and Jeff called it a

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,719
framework so it's a a collection of um

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
aspects that help you achieve a

42
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,600
particular purpose

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,719
so I think it'd be useful for this not

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,479
to get into

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,879
framework methodology discussion sure

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
yeah I think that's that's just Elmo

47
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,440
those right so our little red friend can

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,640
just jump out there and right so I think

49
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,879
the the idea behind the

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:28,080
topic is that there's quite

51
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,680
often tool tools should be there to help

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,879
enable us to do the thing that we need

53
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,080
to do yeah but quite often they get in

54
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
the

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
way of doing the thing that we need to

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,959
do because of some some particular

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,319
reason perhaps

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,800
because everybody in the organization is

59
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,159
told to use the same tool that could be

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,959
a reason for it to get in the way right

61
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,879
but it's not really a generic framework

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,400
right it's it's a specific tool and it's

63
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,519
for a specific

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
outcome and

65
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,840
people have to use it for everything and

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,000
therefore you start having it used for

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,959
jobs that it shouldn't be used for

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,200
right um yeah and then we also have the

69
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,360
the boiler plating of

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,239
tools yep

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,319
where a tool is configured or locked

72
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,680
down or over

73
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,159
controlled I've seen far too many people

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,120
trying to work in an agile way and the

75
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,640
custodians of the tool their job is the

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,080
tool and they lock the tool down so you

77
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
have very little permissions to uh

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,040
change it so your team wants to innovate

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,879
or try something differently but you

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,480
have to use this tool even selecting

81
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,159
another tool is considered heresy um

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,159
varying the way the tool is used for

83
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,840
whatever reason is considered a breach

84
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:01,000
um and people it then becomes an attack

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,280
on someone's St status to suggest a

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,120
different configuration of the tool

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,959
someone will go off and read a Blog

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,879
article or something and then just put

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,599
another bit of formula in it and lock it

90
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,920
down and make this a mandatory field and

91
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,320
next thing you know uh you're looking at

92
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,919
a

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,440
700% like that's a number by the way it

94
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,360
was proven I did this with a client the

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,440
tool we wanted to use to the tool we

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,039
mandated to use it was a

97
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,639
700% increase in admin to Ed the

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:33,880
mandated tool as opposed to the

99
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,360
preferred tool cu the reason we wanted

100
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,360
to use a preferred tool it wasn't locked

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,440
down uh I've got a another a concrete

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,880
example that I can even name I can even

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,160
name and shame the organization and it's

104
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Microsoft uh they had on the Windows

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
team in the old days they used to have

106
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,680
the windows

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,479
teams process yeah your devops it used

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,720
to be up on up on giop GitHub upub so

109
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:08,440
you could go go take a look at it and on

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,919
the bug work item there was 170 plus

111
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,039
required fields in order to sub required

112
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,120
required Fields you could not save a bug

113
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,280
unless you'd filled out all of these 170

114
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
required Fields oh there would be some

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,240
nonsense saved in that right cuz only

116
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,639
non not only some nonsense saved in that

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,520
role but there's the old adage that if

118
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,160
make something even a little bit

119
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,080
difficult you vastly reduce the instance

120
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
of action right yeah that's why we have

121
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,400
locks on our front doors right there's

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
not a lock that anybody has on their

123
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,120
front door that somebody who really

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,960
wants to get in can't get in right but

125
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,440
if you deter people enough and make it

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,280
enough difficult then most people don't

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
bother their butt doing it and that's

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,160
the same with with anything you put in

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
the way that's the the configurations

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,960
the complexities in the tool that you're

131
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,319
using anything that you put in the way

132
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,599
vastly reduces the

133
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,680
um the the the instance of people

134
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,800
actually doing the thing you want them

135
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,560
to do which poent maybe you don't want

136
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,720
them to raise bugs right maybe that's

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
that's exactly why that ties into

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,800
transparency right and there's proven

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,440
evidence that creating a culture that is

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,919
more comfortable raising bugs talking

141
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,960
about incidents and near misses creates

142
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,160
a cult C culture of quality which

143
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,479
results in performance Improvement and

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,080
enhancement but what we're talking about

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:44,080
is putting the minimal sufficient

146
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,120
obstacle in the road so that the it just

147
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,000
it's too big right the activation energy

148
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,599
is too great so people don't do it and

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,599
typically the way this has worked around

150
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,240
in a lot of the Enterprises I've seen is

151
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:56,960
they then end up putting default

152
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,080
information in these mandatory fields to

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,240
get around that hurdle to make people

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,120
use it will just default fill it anyway

155
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,039
which means that you end up with more

156
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,520
noise than signal well this is why in

157
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,199
aure devops there's a template option I

158
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,319
don't know if you've you've if you're as

159
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,720
your developed user you might have

160
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,879
noticed on a work item you can click on

161
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,479
the ellipse and create a template from

162
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,720
the work item that you're viewing and it

163
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,360
will pre-populate a whole bunch of

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
fields and then you can just apply that

165
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,360
template when you open a new work item

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,840
apply that template and it will fill out

167
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,919
a whole bunch of stuff right um but then

168
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
you've got

169
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,440
noise then you get noise right if that

170
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,360
if that data I I it's the same reason

171
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,360
that I

172
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,080
always have strong words when people

173
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,400
want to template their work items right

174
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,599
I've got got whenever I add this type of

175
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,599
backlog item I want these 10 tasks to

176
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,960
appear under it and it's but it has to

177
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,639
be a user story Martin it has to be in

178
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,840
user story syn yeah that to has to be

179
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,039
with story points with story points

180
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,319
right and that's that's why that's why

181
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,960
you get get backlog items in somebody's

182
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:08,039
backlog that says as a product owner I

183
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,960
want or as a system as system for I want

184
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,159
as a systems integrator it's like the

185
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,440
the

186
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:18,159
those that square peg round hole right

187
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,919
you're trying to fit something into a

188
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,520
format use a tool for a task that it was

189
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:26,440
not meant to be used for and then it

190
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,479
ends up inhibiting value reducing

191
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,879
transparency because people can't really

192
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,560
see what's going on

193
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,880
a good example that I hit recently uh

194
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,360
same same same idea that OB Fusion that

195
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,039
lack of reducing

196
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,760
transparency is and and there's a little

197
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,760
bit I know this is a tools conversation

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,160
so it's a little bit Azure devops but

199
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,040
when you when you put a work item in you

200
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,200
know how you've got the different levels

201
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,600
in Azure devop you've got backlog and

202
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,959
then you've got the feature level and

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,399
then you've got the epic level you can

204
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,680
call them whatever you want and you can

205
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,880
have up to seven levels but that's

206
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,399
effectively that's it the out of the box

207
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,240
when when you have a a the caman board

208
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,120
the board's view it's not called campan

209
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
board but board's view there boards and

210
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,399
then task board right those are the two

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,000
views on the on the board view if you uh

212
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,560
it defaults The Columns to all of the

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,920
states that are physically on the work

214
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,000
item right so if the work item is new

215
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,160
approved uh

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,760
uh in progress done right that will be

217
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
the default column

218
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,200
and then teams can break them down and

219
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,240
make them more columns if they want out

220
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,399
of

221
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,880
that but in a team that I'm working with

222
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,079
at the moment and this is across an

223
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,320
entire group so there's about 13 teams

224
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,200
working in this in this project

225
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,200
somebody's created a dependency work

226
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
item right which is which is okay this

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,839
is like an external to this group of

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,720
people's dependency that we want to

229
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,120
Monitor and track but they've added it

230
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,959
to the backlog level and it has eight

231
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,560
eight states that are completely

232
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,240
different from the the the the the

233
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,720
backlog item state which means the

234
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,600
default when you go to look at the

235
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,800
boards is eight states no there's eight

236
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,920
plus the back right so 13 15 and it just

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,640
effectively shits it all out right yeah

238
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,040
and then if you try and move a backlog

239
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:28,000
item into a column that isn't a state on

240
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,399
that backlog item it zops back to the

241
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,920
start because it doesn't know what to do

242
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,839
with it because that state doesn't exist

243
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,200
on that backlog item but this is the

244
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,440
infu that is a perfect example of a

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,600
tool complicating already complex work

246
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,480
yes the tool is getting in the way and

247
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,079
but it's it's there's two difficulties

248
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
right there's somebody made a

249
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,000
mistake they didn't know it was a

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,040
mistake but somebody did something that

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,680
reduced the effectiveness of the tool

252
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,160
made it harder to use the tool for the

253
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,800
majority of people that are using it

254
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,079
they had good intentions but they it

255
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,760
harder but as soon as that is is is

256
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,760
raised it's a very easy physical fix

257
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
right you just take that dependency and

258
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,680
move it out of the backlog group and

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,240
you're done to 100% fixes the problem

260
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,839
instantly

261
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,040
but how do you get approval to do that

262
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,240
well this is this is an interesting

263
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,680
thing that I'd like to call out a few

264
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,800
aspects of that example the first one is

265
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,279
the the whole lean approach

266
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,760
of a local optimization for a suboptimal

267
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,519
hole right we're solving a very small

268
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,279
problem in a big system and we've just

269
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:51,240
made it insurmountably worse for

270
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:54,680
everyone else yep um the second one

271
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,800
is authorization and the need for

272
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,240
architecture and this is something that

273
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,760
is not disgusting a

274
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,760
lot I know we we talk about it in the

275
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,519
PSD my favorite course and my favorite

276
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,639
version of it was the original version

277
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,000
that you and I qualified under back in

278
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,959
the day five day one and we had a good

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,040
at least dayong discussion about

280
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,800
architecture and the ilities and the

281
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,519
need for architecture and the fact that

282
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,760
we start at a high level and we work

283
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,680
down and architecture is part of the

284
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,000
planning process and and how you do

285
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,079
emergent architecture yeah it's and

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,959
without ending up with that famous house

287
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,839
the Winchester House in America right

288
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,360
because we've we've seen products like

289
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,639
that what you're describing as a

290
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,560
Winchester House process just a quick

291
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,160
pause here uh anybody who hasn't heard

292
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,920
of it get on your favorite search engine

293
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,720
and have a look at the Winchester House

294
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,480
a fascinating story truly tragic um a

295
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
wonderful collection of Foles and

296
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,600
Architectural stupidities because it

297
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,880
there was no overall design or intent

298
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,839
with it yeah and so with a tool

299
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,959
particularly Enterprise tools we need to

300
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:09,720
have architecture in line with the

301
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:13,079
organizational process yep so we have to

302
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,839
have freedom at the team

303
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:19,079
level but it's done in such a way that

304
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,160
one team changing something doesn't by

305
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,040
default impact and roll out and it's

306
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,560
trying to find that goldilock spot

307
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,480
between Some central body going

308
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,680
everybody must do it exactly like this

309
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,920
no Freedom no flexibility

310
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,600
and each team coming up with some change

311
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
that then ripples out and corrupts every

312
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,079
other team yep exactly exactly and and

313
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,040
I've worked in a lot of organizations

314
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,800
where that that's true that there's some

315
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,360
local optimization and sometimes it's

316
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:52,519
it's um f founding founded in business

317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,720
need right the the the sometimes for a

318
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,800
big organiz the example I'm thinking of

319
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,560
is when I worked at Marl

320
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Lynch um they have the the people who

321
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,240
make the real money for the

322
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:09,040
business are the the trading desk yeah

323
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,800
folks everybody else is supporting them

324
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,480
and at some point some tool that

325
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,639
somebody wrote inside of the

326
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,880
organization got installed on a trading

327
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,399
desk platform on the trading desk

328
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,079
platform that they were using and it

329
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,279
disrupted the core trading desk software

330
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,079
right which is a big no no because

331
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,600
that's hundreds of millions every second

332
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:31,639
it's not working that that things are

333
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,800
going to be a

334
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,680
problem so they instituted a rule that

335
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,440
every piece of software in the

336
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,399
organization has to be validated on that

337
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,440
platform has to

338
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,839
be but now you've created a a

339
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,600
bottleneck inside of the organization

340
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:55,160
for for example I was building a small

341
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,800
application that ran on uh call center

342
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,680
people's desktop that popped the the

343
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,120
calls for them right so I I it connected

344
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,720
to a database listed all the the the

345
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,519
customer data allowed them to change and

346
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,680
enter customiz data and then pop the

347
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,560
tappy interface to to to to call that

348
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,360
person so that they could do their sales

349
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,920
stuff for selling right completely

350
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,240
different but we had to go through that

351
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,519
three-month process of getting our

352
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,800
software validated on that

353
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:30,480
environment and all it needed was any

354
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,120
software going on these machines needs

355
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,920
to go through this process right yes to

356
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,800
firew I

357
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,440
remember a similar discussion when I was

358
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,240
a software engineer at Nationwide

359
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,319
Building Society uh I got pinged a

360
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,600
message from the security team that I

361
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,120
was messing around with certain bits and

362
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,160
pieces of the

363
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,440
computer uh which made sense given I was

364
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,360
doing Biz talk development and if you've

365
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,519
ever done bis talk development um you

366
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,360
will be familiar with this thing called

367
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,000
the gak and

368
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,720
bis got really good at this weird thing

369
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,199
called UNG gaking so the global assembly

370
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,800
case where you put assemblies that you

371
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,959
wanted bis talk to consume and if you're

372
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,360
doing local development you had to do

373
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
some food right you had to do some dance

374
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
and of course this flagged up and hit

375
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,839
security like this guy's messing with

376
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
some really fundamental it's like that

377
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,279
was a monitored folder it's like yeah

378
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,160
it's yeah yeah I'm just doing what

379
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,360
you're pay me for but um and this this

380
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,600
can happen so is a processor tool Martin

381
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,920
this is where we're sort of heading

382
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,199
towards do processes become tool like in

383
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,279
their

384
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:46,199
manifestation I think processes become

385
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,680
tool like and I'm I'm I'm going to say

386
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:53,920
this in a bad way if they're used like

387
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:57,040
tools right so a tool is something that

388
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,759
like a hammer I don't alter the hammer

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,000
in order to use it effectively in

390
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,920
different circumstances it's a hammer

391
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,520
right it has the shape of the hammer is

392
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,439
the way that the manufacturer intended

393
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,959
it to be me modifying that hammer is is

394
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,600
not something I can't imagine 99.9% of

395
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,919
people out there modifying their hammer

396
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,959
in order to have a different outcome

397
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,240
right or to use it in a different

398
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,280
circumstance there might be the odd

399
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
occasion where tools have multi-purpose

400
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,959
and somebody's figured out some weird

401
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,720
thing that you can use a tool for that

402
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,160
works pretty well but in general

403
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,280
intended use for the tool is the use

404
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,360
that you're going to use it for and if

405
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:38,000
you treat practices like that whether

406
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,360
it's story points or it's um uh uh

407
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,240
planning poker right that's a practice

408
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,440
how to get story points the the three

409
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,520
questions whichever three questions you

410
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,880
like whether it's the daily scrum three

411
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,840
questions or the Sprint retro three

412
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,600
questions right uh if you treat that as

413
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,799
a tool I.E this is how you're going to

414
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
do things this is the only way to get to

415
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,320
this outcome this is the only way to use

416
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,880
this thing then it becomes a tool and

417
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,600
potentially inhibits if you're using it

418
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:09,360
in the wrong circumstances um the way

419
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,000
you're saying that I'm noticing um a

420
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,400
very strong parallel towards the the

421
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,600
process management tools that we were

422
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,840
talking about

423
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,080
earlier

424
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,799
whenever whenever we become too

425
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,559
constrained in how we apply the tool yep

426
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,159
when when it becomes too locked in it

427
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,159
increases the complexity of the problem

428
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,600
and I think this is one of the reasons

429
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,240
we're both fond of scrum we're fond of

430
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,120
the principles of agility because if you

431
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,120
lean into the lightness of it where we

432
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,320
allow our teams to riff within the the

433
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,480
context and the boundaries of the

434
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,159
framework if we know what the

435
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,280
constraints are and they can use the

436
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,240
framework and they're allowed to

437
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,000
experiment and play with that to find

438
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,600
what works for them when we start

439
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,799
locking things in and over mandating it

440
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,000
we

441
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,799
then start limiting the capacity and

442
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,120
capability of the teams to deliver right

443
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:13,039
so it's at that point be it a business

444
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,600
process be it a a tool physical virtual

445
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,640
whatever with then making the problem

446
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,440
complex and the interesting thing is

447
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,919
when you increase the magnitude of

448
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,760
complexity very soon it tends toward the

449
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,080
boundary of chaos if we thinking of the

450
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,480
Canan framework right because it become

451
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,480
very very unpredictable and the manner

452
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,760
in which we behave becomes unpredictable

453
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,480
as well right yeah it I

454
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,880
it's sometimes easy to do the same thing

455
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,559
over and over again and then quite often

456
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,600
the processes get codified in the tools

457
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,120
as well right so a good good example of

458
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,760
that for me again I I your devops user

459
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,840
not a jira user my claim to fame is I've

460
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,679
never actually touched a jira instance

461
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,360
ever in my life I think that's a pretty

462
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,679
good uh claim but I do play with aure

463
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,400
devops and there's a a thing that I see

464
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,400
teams doing in Retros all the time

465
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,520
there's a plugin for Azure devops which

466
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,960
is called the retrospectives plugin and

467
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,400
it has columns where you add cards for

468
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
uh what went well what didn't go well

469
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,240
what do you want to prove what you want

470
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,240
to keep right so there's those columns

471
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,200
and then in it has a a way for people to

472
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,880
vote on those items to surface what

473
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,640
items do we want to talk about do we

474
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,159
want to deal with and then it has a what

475
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,000
are you going to do about it page and

476
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,360
the idea of that is great right it's

477
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,480
that sounds like it's something that

478
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,039
that you want to do but if you've been

479
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,840
using it for the past 20

480
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:00,159
Sprints suddenly perhaps it just becomes

481
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:03,559
a mechanical thing it becomes just a

482
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,280
tool and there's no emotion in a tool

483
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,720
there's no there's no connection to the

484
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,000
scrum values yeah that's what I was

485
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,000
looking for there's no connection to the

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,080
scrum values and scrum itself scrum

487
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,039
itself can become a tool for

488
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,919
organizations there's a reason it's

489
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,159
called the scrum guide and not the scrum

490
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:24,960
rule book right it's not there is an

491
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,120
organization out there that sells um

492
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,240
their scrum study book and I think

493
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,799
they've managed to get the 4 Pages up to

494
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,039
208 and every something yeah yeah yeah

495
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,919
aw massive here here's the scrum rule

496
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,200
book right scrum body of knowledge there

497
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,000
you go you want scrum in a project

498
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,120
managed way

499
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,640
so how do we so we're saying a let let

500
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,799
me stumble around and find the question

501
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,000
here we're suggesting that overly

502
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,600
constraining means that um business

503
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,640
practices tools whatever become more

504
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,960
tool like when they become man

505
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,840
mechanical in operation we want to

506
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,640
maintain empiricism and the ability to

507
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,600
live the scrum values when we're doing

508
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,880
stuff how what what advice yeah this is

509
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,279
my question what advice or what

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,080
steps could you think of to help

511
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:25,200
somebody if they find their organization

512
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,200
is becoming overly mechanical like in in

513
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,600
their use of tools like a your Dev so

514
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,279
they've locked it down too far you can't

515
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,720
get this out or they're using they

516
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,200
weaponized retrospectives or you know

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,520
everybody has to complete mandatory this

518
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,679
or that or even the reporting on

519
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,720
retrospective output I

520
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,760
find a topic of concern because you

521
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,559
might shut down openness if you know

522
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,240
that the grand Pooh bar of division X is

523
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:55,799
then going to have a look at your retro

524
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,400
output well I I yeah and a good example

525
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,559
is also totally outside of the well well

526
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,760
the core agile space is procurement as

527
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,960
well right where where companies have

528
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,600
processes in place and treat everybody

529
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,360
the same when not necessarily is that

530
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,120
true right you end up with that's that's

531
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,640
the reason I've fallen in love with lean

532
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,679
agile procurement because it applies the

533
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,919
values of lean and agile to the

534
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
procurement process yeah and if we

535
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,120
create a discussion space we can get

536
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,760
through a lot of a lot of which has

537
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,960
become very structured and template

538
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,640
um I think you and I have both completed

539
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,200
bids for multinationals where it you

540
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,520
know took you to better part of three

541
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,400
working days to fill out uh 700 page

542
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,720
that's a mild exaggeration but not by

543
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,760
much

544
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,240
EX I I on on on my current current

545
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,840
engagement I've probably spent a total

546
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,720
of at least 10

547
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,799
days um on admin stuff yeah um and we

548
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,559
need admin right there is a need for it

549
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,799
but how do we how do we create that

550
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:10,760
space where we can focus on the value

551
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:13,120
delivery and reduce the

552
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,200
bureaucracy so but this is this is this

553
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,279
is where I feel

554
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,320
like um there's a word that's used a lot

555
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,760
in the adual state space that is what

556
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,200
we're talking about that people

557
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,279
misunderstand and I feel like I used to

558
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,720
misunderstand as

559
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,720
well um and that's the word

560
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,480
emergent that we talk about the the

561
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:43,799
processes and practices that we

562
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,600
need emerge over time right we talk

563
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,200
about that in in in case of scrum we

564
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,120
talk about it for for everything whether

565
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,919
it's procurement whether it's anything

566
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,600
your process is software development

567
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,279
your processes and practices and the

568
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,600
tools you need the processes you need

569
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,440
the practices you need all emerge over

570
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:06,520
time time and I always used to think

571
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,880
many moons ago that emerge means Boop

572
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,399
now it's

573
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:15,720
here right but emerge also means the

574
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:19,080
continuous shifting of that thing over

575
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,640
time that a process or practice might

576
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,399
emerge and then go away and that's part

577
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:28,880
of that emerging the the the what you

578
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:31,399
need emerges over time and that idea of

579
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,440
the constant

580
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:38,520
shifting of um processes practices and

581
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,919
tools what you need goes against that

582
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,720
idea of we just have one thing one way

583
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,480
to do it right that's that's that

584
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,279
imposed one way to do it so whether

585
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,640
that's we're all going to use user

586
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,240
stories right or we're all going to use

587
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,159
story points or we're all going to use a

588
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,600
hammer and every problem is a nail right

589
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,320
or or or procurement right everybody's

590
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,080
the same so when I'm filling out the

591
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,000
vendor form I have to fill out a

592
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,640
delivery address even though I'm

593
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,840
delivering it virtually how does that

594
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,360
make sense or um you know whatever

595
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,080
whatever I mean that's a little thing

596
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,880
right but it that's part of that process

597
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:21,120
so how do you

598
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,799
create those processes that are more

599
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,960
Dynamic that take into account of that

600
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,720
emergent nature of what you might need

601
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:33,840
over time but businesses are designed to

602
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,480
codify the way you do things and then in

603
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,000
Shrine them and lock them in right

604
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,200
you've tightened up all the bolts and

605
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,919
now it can't it can't move

606
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,399
anymore I think this is um there's multi

607
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:50,120
Parts in in the way I would reflect back

608
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:51,640
what you've said is that I think the way

609
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,760
you're describing the process is

610
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:58,919
becoming locked in is very

611
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,880
taoris y and it's that whole concept of

612
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,320
best practice that

613
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,000
once oh hang on that's just Homer

614
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,120
telling me what time it

615
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,120
is um so it's it's taoris in the fact

616
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,720
that we will achieve best practice and

617
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,720
this is the older predictive way of

618
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,600
doing things um because project

619
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:25,120
management is an Adaptive thing now if

620
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,640
we lock ourselves into a space of of

621
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,720
best practice or known way of doing

622
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,240
things without allowing or

623
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,760
tolerating processes to e and flow it

624
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,360
means our

625
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,080
organizations are more robust and this

626
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,840
is the difference between robust

627
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,760
resilient and antifragile so if a a

628
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,440
robust organization will be able to

629
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,519
withstand the buffets of a a turbulent

630
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,279
World whereas if we build resilient or

631
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,519
anti fragile organizations they're more

632
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,760
organic and they will be able to adapt

633
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,200
adapt and change responding to various

634
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,519
stimuli which means that they they will

635
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,760
have a process

636
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:11,159
for deprecating processes right though

637
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,159
as part of their adaptation they can bin

638
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,080
stuff they can bring in a different

639
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,880
process they will be able to respond

640
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,720
more

641
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,720
quickly and this I love the quote that

642
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,039
the whole point of agile is to turn on

643
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,720
the dime for a dime to be able to Pivot

644
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,279
to be able to respond that that ultimate

645
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,559
Essence but because agile's 25 years old

646
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,880
now roughly um it's

647
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,600
now it's now mainstream it's only the

648
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,399
late adopters that are coming around to

649
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,000
it you know there's a few pockets of our

650
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,960
organization uh where it hasn't been

651
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,760
early majority have already hopped on

652
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,200
board with agile and it's now getting

653
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,000
into the the late majority right yeah

654
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,320
yeah yeah but how do we bring in this

655
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,640
concept cep of resilience the the whole

656
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,080
antifragility thing of that uh

657
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,240
empiricism loing the values and in

658
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,760
response to your question like how do we

659
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,919
do that I think it comes down to having

660
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,519
clear principles if we have a a good

661
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,760
business strategy Y and good principles

662
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,519
and then we just let our people be

663
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,519
awesome within the boundaries of

664
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,640
business strategy and core principles

665
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:25,080
principles not rules right that's

666
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,080
principles not

667
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,039
policies yes and anytime you have a you

668
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,559
have a policy you're enshrining one way

669
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,679
to do something when you have a

670
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,880
principle you enable people to make

671
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,600
choices within the bounds of those those

672
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,360
those core principles and it's it's like

673
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,159
if we're designing

674
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,279
uh a well-engineered piece of software

675
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,840
and you know many moons ago I was a

676
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,880
software engineer so I sort of lean back

677
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,559
to that but those principles of uh you

678
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,480
know for instance solid writing good

679
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,799
code that aligned with the solid

680
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,840
principles allowed you the freedom to

681
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,360
find the optimal solution within your

682
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,559
context within your constraints that

683
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,200
aligned with those principles to make it

684
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:20,080
more maintainable durable testable Etc

685
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,080
so now that we've moved out of that um

686
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,640
you know some of the object-oriented

687
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,679
space we're moving on from we're into

688
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,760
the world of microservices and

689
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,360
architecture like that and

690
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,760
devops and the the rise in devops means

691
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,480
we need to lean into the principles of

692
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,919
automation of faster feedback loop of

693
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:44,559
zero touch right but its principles

694
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,159
gives you Elbow Room yeah give you gives

695
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,799
you room to experiment to try different

696
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,080
things to see if a slightly different

697
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:56,039
way is a better way to do something

698
00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:00,880
right which which for lots of

699
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:02,960
organizations I feel like it's it's that

700
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,279
and I do I do definitely agree with you

701
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:10,080
is that that taoris view that that um uh

702
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,399
turn of the century Industrial

703
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:18,039
Revolution thinking where businesses

704
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,960
existed in in very sparse markets right

705
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:23,559
so they could they could afford to say

706
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,080
here's the one way we're going to do

707
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,519
things and build a business around that

708
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,919
one way we're going to do things but

709
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,880
today the markets are so competitive and

710
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,200
so

711
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,000
shifting that that there's I can't

712
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,320
remember what it's called there's

713
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,519
there's a name for um when you've got

714
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,120
too many species in an ecosystem all

715
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:50,320
competing for the same

716
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,919
Niche right that some of those species

717
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,760
are going to die out because they're not

718
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,480
going to be able to adapt to somebody's

719
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,240
going to be better at it same reason

720
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,440
that that that that uh um modern humans

721
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,039
out evolved the Neanderthal right we we

722
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,279
probably killed them off because we were

723
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:12,480
the more more aggressive maybe more uh

724
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:15,279
uh uh thinky uh solving problems well we

725
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,000
more successful EV evidence suggests we

726
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,919
interbred with them but um sure but yeah

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,080
that that whole emergence that that that

728
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,159
responsive as you were talking I just

729
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,720
kept thinking of that that buzz phrase

730
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,120
that's been around for a while now of

731
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,960
vuka volatility uncertainty

732
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,039
complexity

733
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,919
vka something yeah and it it also

734
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,559
reminds me of um uh back in the olden

735
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:49,720
days like when you're talking about this

736
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:52,240
that the the days of sale when the Dutch

737
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,840
French Spanish and English were chasing

738
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,600
each other around the world's oceans

739
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,080
colonizing and pillaging and destroying

740
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,960
the world um

741
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,760
the the British quote for Friday was um

742
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,799
a willing Foe and SEO and it's

743
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,360
interesting that that style of

744
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,600
leadership where once they were out if

745
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,360
they were out in their ship they they

746
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,480
they decided there was a lot of freedom

747
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,480
and

748
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,159
latitude but there was some core

749
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,159
principles that guided it um and so if

750
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:27,720
we can think of creating a space of

751
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,480
autonomy based upon a direct ction and

752
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,440
principles within our teams and enabling

753
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,480
some clear boundaries and I think this

754
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,880
is the thing most organizations really

755
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,440
struggle with what are the constraints

756
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,639
and boundaries of your tooling of your

757
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,960
process of your communication of your

758
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:47,559
problem space if we can nail

759
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,639
that then we can do it because according

760
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:53,840
to the scrum guide the team has

761
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:57,919
flexibility to choose tools that help

762
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:01,120
them the most so they should have a

763
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:05,080
mechanism to choose a different

764
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,399
tool but that sounds hard

765
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,800
Simon

766
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,040
uh I think it was Teddy Roosevelt said

767
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,560
that uh nothing worthwhile in life is

768
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,000
going to be

769
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,040
easy it's hard to come up with

770
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,079
principles because you're you're

771
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,679
thinking about what is the core thing

772
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,520
that I'm trying to achieve whereas it's

773
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,159
much easier to just say here's a set of

774
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,599
rules that you have to follow not why

775
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,480
you have to follow it or what you're

776
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,320
trying to achieve as the

777
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,399
outcome it's also much harder

778
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,000
to uh check against principles it

779
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,639
becomes very nuanced it means you

780
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,240
actually have to talk to people I am

781
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,240
concerned about your compliance or I'm

782
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,720
concerned about how you're enacting this

783
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,359
particular principle I don't think you

784
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,599
are let's discuss this it it means that

785
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,800
our leadership style must become more

786
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,320
collaborative it must become more intent

787
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,560
based

788
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:11,839
because um you and I could both enact a

789
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,760
core principle say we're talking about

790
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,119
um say the principle of

791
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,520
transparency you and I could both enact

792
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,680
it in slightly different ways both honor

793
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,960
it within terms of our context but it

794
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:29,400
would appear radically different and so

795
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,720
it would Rec a conversation right yeah

796
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,240
and intent intent based leadership if

797
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,440
anybody's confused by that term um have

798
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,760
a read of a book called turn this ship

799
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,839
Around by David Marquette um that would

800
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,200
lead you in the right direction for for

801
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,000
for what they mean if if you can't be

802
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,800
bothered reading the book because you're

803
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,040
not a reader there's also a 15minute

804
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,640
YouTube video that also yeah and also

805
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,280
yeah um there's a huge like US military

806
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,760
created some good things thinking in

807
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,319
this space no General Stanley mccristal

808
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,000
team of teams uh jao willink and Le

809
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:07,440
babit with extreme ownership and

810
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,359
followed that up with the dichotomy of

811
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,880
leadership um and David marqu turn your

812
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,760
ship around you know there's there's

813
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,920
some good thinking in this space more

814
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,480
recently there's also a bunch of stuff

815
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,400
around red team thinking as well which I

816
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,119
think brings into that space too yeah

817
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,720
it's it's but it's a lot of it is

818
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,599
principle based and the need for

819
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,160
adaptation well when you're when you're

820
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,760
in the middle of nowhere with no ability

821
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,240
to get help from

822
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,960
anybody rules don't help right you need

823
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,839
the principles to have the freedom to

824
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,000
make decisions within the bounds of

825
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,000
those principles so that you can you can

826
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,319
be the most effective you can at

827
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,680
whatever your mission objectives are

828
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:58,240
yeah be clear upon your mission and be

829
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:02,480
willing to adapt I do I do always um

830
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,160
I I I I have a a thing that I I say I'm

831
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,079
actually I'm looking for you to correct

832
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,520
my

833
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,680
saying uh is that I I I was always asked

834
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,920
people when when did they believe that

835
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,200
the military stopped believing in

836
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,240
command and

837
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,599
control um and I usually my answer is

838
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,599
when Napoleon defeated the Prussian

839
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,960
Army um and Napoleon was the

840
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,319
first military

841
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,920
leader who pushed respon on a on a big

842
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,920
scale anyway who pushed responsibility

843
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,800
down the

844
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,680
organization and whereas in the Prussian

845
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,119
Army that he was fighting against the

846
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,960
the the the soldier on the battlefield

847
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:47,560
had to ask a sergeant who had to send a

848
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,280
runner to the lieutenant who had to send

849
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,440
a runner to the major who had to send a

850
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,880
runner to the general and then all the

851
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,880
way back down the chain to get the

852
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,160
answer to what should we do next well I

853
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,599
I would suggest

854
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,720
there are many many instances of that

855
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,280
still being the predominant way of

856
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,000
thinking um a lot of time you know the

857
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,119
Special Forces definitely have more

858
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,560
freedom you know the the elite units but

859
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,520
you have a look at the history we got a

860
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,040
big danger of digressing here um sure

861
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
that's the whole reason that World War I

862
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,240
turned into such a meat grinder is that

863
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,680
it was the people hiding in you know uh

864
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,599
Berlin and

865
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:31,359
London um put pushing some stuff around

866
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,240
the map and not enabling free thought

867
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,839
you know the the whole reason that um

868
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,119
the disaster of The galipoli Landings

869
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,079
and

870
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,440
the the the failure of that was because

871
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,119
a general decided halfway up the hill

872
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,839
like the Anzac could have taken the top

873
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,520
of the hill fortified and then pushed

874
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,200
through but some clown decided it was

875
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,359
time for a teab break halfway up which

876
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,520
gave time for the Turks to reinforce and

877
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,880
you've got immensely capable service

878
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,599
serviceman on both sides y but then just

879
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,920
basically dug in and I all I'm thinking

880
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,160
about when you're saying that is Black

881
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,480
Adder Simon that's all I'm thinking

882
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,480
about that that arity of of that going

883
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,480
over the top in the trenches oh yes you

884
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,359
forgot your stick ah yes I'd hate to

885
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,480
face a German machine gun without my

886
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:22,079
pointed stick thank you

887
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,440
Baldrick yes exactly yeah it's and so

888
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,760
let's bring it back to the topic so

889
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,240
tools adding to the complexity so

890
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,200
basically what we're saying and we we

891
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,240
went on a flight of fancy as we tend to

892
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:40,720
when we both start discussing um what we

893
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:43,280
arrived at is it is possible to use a

894
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,400
physical virtual or business process as

895
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,720
a tool that increases the complexity

896
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,599
that uh boosts the amount of effort you

897
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,040
and your team have to expend to be able

898
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,440
to achieve sometimes even the most

899
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:02,000
simple of tasks

900
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,880
because it's just unnecessary unworldly

901
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,079
painful Etc so people will either not

902
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,920
use that process tool and you'll then

903
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,319
end up with stuff off the books what

904
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,760
we're saying from that is the more

905
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,040
efficient and effective way of helping

906
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:23,800
teams achieve greatness is by tapping

907
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,520
into core principles much harder to do

908
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,079
but it enables more latitude and freedom

909
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,720
within clear

910
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:37,480
constraints how if if so there's then

911
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:42,720
maybe maybe this is a good good segue

912
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:46,400
into that idea of autonomy versus

913
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:51,000
alignment right generally

914
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,359
alignment um is often fulfilled through

915
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,319
tooling right people people align

916
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,359
through tools and and if a practice is

917
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,480
BL it becomes a tool right how how do

918
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,800
how do we tell the

919
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,160
difference

920
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,240
between

921
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,000
alignment that might hinder the team a

922
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,000
little bit at the lower level CU they've

923
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,560
got something extra to do that is needed

924
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,880
in order to be all going in the same

925
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,520
direction

926
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,560
versus the things that people come up

927
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,079
with for us to do at that

928
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,400
level that just just in hinder for for

929
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,000
for little or

930
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:38,440
no perceivable value or outcome right

931
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,359
how do we tell the difference between

932
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,680
those two things I I got to fall back to

933
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,640
my natural scrum Master stance and just

934
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,359
ask the team like is it helping right

935
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,720
they don't make it harder than it has to

936
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,640
be this is what we're saying don't over

937
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,079
complicate an already messy and complex

938
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,240
situation ask people if it's helping and

939
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,839
this is where alignment of a purpose is

940
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,839
is so important you know the the

941
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:07,560
apocryphal story of JFK visiting NASA

942
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,960
and he bumps into a chat mopping the

943
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,960
floor and he goes what are you doing and

944
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,760
he goes me I'm helping put a man on the

945
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,599
moon you how many times have you worked

946
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,000
with people in a team uh where they

947
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,720
don't understand what the business

948
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,480
strategy is they don't know the guard

949
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,200
rails of their technical strategy and

950
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,000
it's to quote Lewis Carol you know and

951
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,880
it's the cheshier C if you don't know

952
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,960
where you're going all roads will get

953
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,839
you there

954
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,599
yeah or are if you don't know where

955
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,440
you're going how will you ever get there

956
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,920
well yeah and the thing is if we don't

957
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,640
know where we're going you you've got

958
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,200
different people and like you've got

959
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,880
explorers who just can't wait to get

960
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,160
over the next Hill doesn't matter

961
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,800
whether it's in the right direction as

962
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,200
long as it's a cool and interesting Hill

963
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,800
and then you've got other people who

964
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,559
will not do anything unless there's a

965
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,160
clear Direction so they just set up camp

966
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,160
and then dig in

967
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,000
so you end up with this basically you

968
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,760
create a diaspora within your

969
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,359
organization where people are just going

970
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,800
off doing random stuff because you

971
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:14,240
haven't put that clear Direction down

972
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,319
yeah so we need a purpose we need a

973
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,319
strategy we need a

974
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,680
direction we need ruthlessness on value

975
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,319
and this is where we should be using

976
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,240
evidence-based management good

977
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,640
leadership principles to do the hard

978
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,640
work and Define and work with your

979
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,839
people to say what the values of your

980
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,240
organization are what your strategy is

981
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:38,119
and what principles you're going to use

982
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,559
to get there because then people can

983
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,960
find out whether they want to be in or

984
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:46,079
out of the boat well even even not just

985
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,119
the values of of the

986
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,559
organization but what does value

987
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:56,559
mean to the organization what does it

988
00:43:52,559 --> 00:44:01,319
mean to the business yeah yeah it's so I

989
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:04,559
I I very rarely encounter an

990
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:08,040
organization that already and and that

991
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,920
we're probably jaded Simon in

992
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,000
that companies that are doing awesome at

993
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,200
this don't call us for help right so

994
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,040
well they've got it in Spades right it's

995
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,760
but the thing is that it's that great

996
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,640
quote from bander Brothers is they

997
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,280
they're going into Bastone the regular

998
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,200
infantry going out and the the power

999
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,400
Troopers going in chap coming out says

1000
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
you're going to the Germans are coming

1001
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,880
from everywhere you're going to be

1002
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,319
surrounded he just looks him go son

1003
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,760
we're paratroopers we're meant to be

1004
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,559
surrounded right

1005
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,240
you if if you as a

1006
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,800
consultant as a

1007
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:47,040
coach don't are not comfortable and

1008
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:50,599
going helping a client who will need

1009
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,319
help you've picked the wrong job yeah

1010
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,440
absolutely right so I I know there's

1011
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:58,440
there's a lot of organizations out there

1012
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,240
that are smashing this there's a lot of

1013
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,200
organizations out there that have really

1014
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,480
good

1015
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:09,200
principles that are making it easy for

1016
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,760
people to thrive uh I'm reading a year

1017
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,960
without pants which is a story about

1018
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,480
WordPress great book great read and

1019
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,000
WordPress were founded on this whole

1020
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,000
idea of just getting awesome people to

1021
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,680
be

1022
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,599
awesome and and virtually from the start

1023
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,280
right so from the start up you know and

1024
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,559
and one of their core founding

1025
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,559
principles was open source that

1026
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,440
everything they did people could copy

1027
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:41,200
and fork and Spike and do whatever they

1028
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:43,319
went with that that fundamental ethos of

1029
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,520
a communitybased development flipping it

1030
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:50,720
into a business enabled really super

1031
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:54,880
smart people to solve a very tough

1032
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,880
problem in an Innovative and creative

1033
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,680
way so yeah great caller great shout out

1034
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,359
great reminder Martin that there is some

1035
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:08,800
wonderful examples of this out there

1036
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:11,160
yeah there so but you and I quite often

1037
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,640
only see the companies that are not

1038
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,000
doing so well at this because they're

1039
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,200
the ones that call us that need help so

1040
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,040
our view our view is a little bit if we

1041
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,800
if somebody asks us how many

1042
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,920
organizations do you see that are being

1043
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,280
successful the answer is not many

1044
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,440
because the the the many that are are

1045
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,680
are not the ones that that need our help

1046
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,440
right well I've I've had um some very

1047
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,200
short engagements where I've gone in and

1048
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,480
people have said how are we doing go in

1049
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:41,359
again you're doing great you don't need

1050
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,880
me yeah I I I always find if this was

1051
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,200
specifically a scrum engagement many

1052
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,200
years ago but if if the customer says

1053
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,359
we're doing awesome at scrum we don't

1054
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,880
know why we need your help right then

1055
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,200
you know it's going to be a total [Â __Â ]

1056
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,079
show when you get there um but if they

1057
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,440
if if they say well we're trying to do

1058
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,960
some stuff we think we're doing okay

1059
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,119
we're not really sure whether we're

1060
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,200
actually adding value we need some extra

1061
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,079
help then you usually they're doing a

1062
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,200
lot better than they think they are

1063
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,520
because they've realized right that that

1064
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:15,079
that they know they know less than they

1065
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,559
know um and yeah there's a principle of

1066
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:18,760
learning that they're demonstrating

1067
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,960
right they're open to be

1068
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,880
open open to the understanding that they

1069
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,720
don't know everything whereas soon as a

1070
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,599
company or people in the organization

1071
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,839
are of the attitude

1072
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:31,280
um what because that's where you get the

1073
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,040
why do we need to change right why

1074
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,480
should we change there's no interest in

1075
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,440
change because obviously the way we're

1076
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,319
doing it right now is the perfect way

1077
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,359
and that's where the way we do things

1078
00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:44,319
becomes a tool so woody woody that's the

1079
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:46,839
way we've always done it that's the way

1080
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:51,359
we've always done things right get off

1081
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:54,040
get off my lawn is also a right come

1082
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:59,200
that it's so

1083
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:01,960
easy to keep doing things the same way

1084
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:05,119
that we've always done things it takes

1085
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,280
courage and openness and respect to do

1086
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,160
things in a different way where we might

1087
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,640
have friction we might have difficulty

1088
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,079
things are not where we think they need

1089
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,359
to be in order for us to function at our

1090
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:26,280
best but in doing that in going through

1091
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:28,880
that Journey we discover a new new way

1092
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,160
of doing things a new way of working

1093
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:36,880
that can often be more valuable than

1094
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,960
what it was before and I think you on

1095
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,440
top of all the things you called out it

1096
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,160
is going to require work it's also going

1097
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,640
to require effort and it's going to

1098
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,359
require some architectural thinking of

1099
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,760
where do you want to go and how do you

1100
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,599
what are the boundaries that we need to

1101
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,559
emerge within to together

1102
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,880
and

1103
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,480
so we we can apply the emerging

1104
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,520
principles of agility to our tooling to

1105
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,240
our business processes to the way we

1106
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,440
collaborate but it's it's going to be a

1107
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,040
graft right yeah it's it's super hard

1108
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,680
there's a lot of it's a lot harder to do

1109
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,839
the right thing for the right reasons

1110
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,200
than to do the wrong thing for the wrong

1111
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:24,680
reasons right it's it's easy just to

1112
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,520
follow that well this is this is the the

1113
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,440
the the board we have everybody needs to

1114
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,440
use the same thing or everybody needs to

1115
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,440
do story points because then I can look

1116
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,839
at anybody's backlog and I know I know

1117
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,960
what it looks like right I know what it

1118
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,640
should look like I know that pattern in

1119
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,480
my head it should have you know as I

1120
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,280
want so that and as soon as it deviates

1121
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,400
from that oh they're doing something oh

1122
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,880
my my favorite one my favorite one Simon

1123
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,839
this was from years ago you'll like this

1124
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,440
one this is this is Scrum becoming a

1125
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:54,599
tool or a thing becoming a tool um is I

1126
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,839
worked with an organization where um the

1127
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,119
scrum Master had just been fired when we

1128
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,520
got there this was back in when I was

1129
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,799
working in the US and we went in and we

1130
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,079
were trying to figure out what was going

1131
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:08,280
on and uh the scrum Master had told the

1132
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,240
team that they're not doing

1133
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,240
scrum and he told them they weren't

1134
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,920
doing scrum because they were were not

1135
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:19,720
standing up during the daily and let's

1136
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:22,000
put aside the fact that stand up is not

1137
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:25,160
part of scrum stand up as an XP thing

1138
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,480
from 20 years before right um but that's

1139
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,760
what the the the the scrum Master had

1140
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,000
said to the to to this group whereas

1141
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,160
this group had decided as a group the

1142
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,160
team had collaborated and decided that

1143
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,720
they didn't want to stand during the

1144
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,240
daily because they'd be towering over

1145
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,480
the disabled person in the wheelchair on

1146
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,799
their team which is perfect sense right

1147
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,599
and which you know which is the very

1148
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:50,440
definition of self-organization and

1149
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:53,359
fulfills the values of scrum but

1150
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:56,839
somebody coming in and thinking of scrum

1151
00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:00,440
as a tool Thou shalt use use it this

1152
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:02,599
way cause that that and that's a that's

1153
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,960
a really bad example right but there's

1154
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,920
lots of smaller examples that have less

1155
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,799
overall impact but it ends up being a

1156
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,200
death of a Thousand Cuts of uh uh uh

1157
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:18,000
making we see these puls all the time at

1158
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:22,839
the moment Simon that that I hate scrum

1159
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:25,520
because um or scrum is a cancer because

1160
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:28,319
posts that you see around at the moment

1161
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,640
and usually there's a list of here's why

1162
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,839
I think this and none of scrum right

1163
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,920
none of it scrum right none of it scrum

1164
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,440
none of it fulfills the the the the

1165
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,480
values of scrum none of it even fills

1166
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,079
basic rules of scrum right there it is

1167
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,960
it's without this is something I'm very

1168
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:47,480
fond of saying and you know shouting

1169
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,359
from the rooftops scrum without the

1170
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,119
values is a brutal tool of nanom

1171
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:53,119
management and

1172
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,599
oppression I would 100% agree with that

1173
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,240
and that's the people hate mechanical

1174
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,319
scrum for good reason it's being

1175
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,040
weaponized and used to thump them with

1176
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:08,680
whereas professional scrum is founded in

1177
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:12,359
values founded in empiricism and I think

1178
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:16,200
that's the point is that a tool used

1179
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:19,920
badly will wreak davage whereas a tool

1180
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,760
used well will help humans achieve

1181
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,040
greatness right if I use a chef's knife

1182
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,760
in the kitchen there is a probability

1183
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,079
depending on the day that I might make a

1184
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,960
decent meal right yeah could be dodgy

1185
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:32,839
just depending with what women fancy I'm

1186
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,839
following but if I take that chef's

1187
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:37,599
knife away from the

1188
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:40,680
kitchen it's very rare it'll find an

1189
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:42,440
appropriate use in the the lounge room

1190
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,960
right

1191
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:48,480
yep and it's that whole thing of using a

1192
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,680
knife as a screwdriver or you know a a

1193
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,000
hammer

1194
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,440
to yeah yeah yeah you know it's but does

1195
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,280
not usually end well knife no um so you

1196
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,280
might have bent the tip of the knife or

1197
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,440
and it'll only let you use Flathead

1198
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:06,440
screws not Philip's head or um oh you're

1199
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,079
not jamming it in hard enough oh okay so

1200
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,920
probably I I should go and get a sharper

1201
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,839
knife at that point

1202
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,680
right yeah exactly exactly wonder why I

1203
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:19,559
cut my how did you cut your hand well

1204
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:21,720
you see I to put a screw in what yeah I

1205
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:26,240
think I think that's the overall

1206
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:31,280
essence of of this topic right right

1207
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:34,599
that um to tools things that are tools

1208
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,559
and were designed as tools are often

1209
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:41,559
suited for a specific job in a specific

1210
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:46,760
circumstance and using them out with

1211
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:49,839
that often has sub standard or even

1212
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,680
negative results from using that that

1213
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:56,359
that that tool that capability and often

1214
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,960
we turn things that in other

1215
00:53:56,359 --> 00:54:01,280
circumstances wouldn't be a

1216
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:07,520
tool into a

1217
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:10,559
tool by focusing only on the mechanics

1218
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,599
of the thing rather than focusing on the

1219
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,440
values and principles of the context

1220
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:19,720
within which we're

1221
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:22,440
working right so up yeah that so to be

1222
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,440
agile

1223
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,319
actually see what I did there um

1224
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,040
needs to be founded in

1225
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:34,359
values and we need to

1226
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,559
really think about how we're living

1227
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:38,920
empiricism of being transparent and

1228
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,920
inspecting and adapting because there

1229
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:44,400
will be an edge case where we will take

1230
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,119
a tool of one context apply it to

1231
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,280
another and it'll be an innovation

1232
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:53,079
awesome go

1233
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:55,280
you but also be willing to run it as a

1234
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:56,799
hypothesis and go if we try this this

1235
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,640
this will happen and if it doesn't if we

1236
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,480
don't get the expected results your your

1237
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,079
hypothesis has been proven faulty so

1238
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,440
just B it so values

1239
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,119
principles mindful

1240
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:14,960
application focus on value let your

1241
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:18,720
paper flourish yeah is that that's

1242
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,480
absolutely that's what folks should be

1243
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:26,039
doing cool well I I think we've done a

1244
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,560
nice little yeah we' looped all the

1245
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:28,839
I think

1246
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,119
[Music]

1247
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:33,200
um yeah I think there's a lot to think

1248
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,599
about in what we talked about I think

1249
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,640
there's a lot to unpack for for many

1250
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:41,680
folks they might see tools in the

1251
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,480
practices that they're doing um but just

1252
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,680
think about the context bring in the

1253
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,760
context bring in the values bring in the

1254
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:53,520
principles and see if it still suits the

1255
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,839
situation that you're using it in and

1256
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,599
maybe you need to adjust

1257
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,559
the way you do things in order to be

1258
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:03,599
more

1259
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,599
effective be agile

1260
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,839
actually
