# Talk us through the new Product Backlog Management course from Scrum Org

#productbacklog management and refinement is a tough skill to master and if you've never had any formal #scrumtraining or #agilecoaching to help you navigate these elements of the #scrumframework, you could spend years trying to get it right.

@ScrumOrg have recognised this and developed a powerful Product Backlog Management course that will help you and your team manage your #productbacklog more effectively.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the new PSPBM course from Scrum.Org and how it will help you and your team crush your product goals.
