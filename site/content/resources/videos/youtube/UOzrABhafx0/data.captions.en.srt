1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,160
so the new uh product backlog management

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,160
course from scrum.org um has been a long

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,080
time coming it's going to be awesome

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,880
it's one of their new skills based uh

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,520
style of classes which are shorter

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,320
classes they're they're eight hours uh

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,400
rather than the usual 16 hours and they

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,080
focus laser focus on one particular

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,560
skill and in this case it's product

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,960
backlog management um and in product

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,279
backlog management we have a number

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,960
number of things that we cover in the

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,800
class uh we're going to cover um where

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,280
where these backlog items come from

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,680
we're going to cover how to manage those

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,079
backlog items how we write those backlog

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,879
items how we break them down into

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,800
smaller units of work uh that are maybe

19
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,000
easier for the team to consume easier

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,640
for people to understand um and in that

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,559
how we maximize the

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,800
transparency of that product backlog by

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,600
enabling the understanding of everybody

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,759
that needs to understand it to be able

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,560
to understand it right um and then how

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,479
do we work through it how do we how do

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,920
we order that backlog um how do we make

28
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,000
it the best backlog it can possibly be

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,640
within the context of what it is we're

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,200
doing and what we know and what we can

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,680
do within our organization uh so it's

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,240
it's it's an awesome uh little uh class

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,640
that helps us get to grips with some of

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,799
the nuances of product backlog

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,000
management how do we make sure that we

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,079
minimize the amount of things that are

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,079
in that product backlog in order to

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,520
maximize the value that we get from it

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,720
