1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
we need to focus on building a culture

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,879
of engineering Excellence the technical

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,960
leadership to set that direction and go

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,840
in that direction and we need to build

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,839
within our

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,600
organization the the knowledge and

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,560
understanding of the theories behind the

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,599
reasons the things work the way they

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,000
work and how we can then apply our

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,000
empirical learnings within our context

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so every organization's different

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,719
with the knowledge of those theories to

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,040
then extrapolate what's the next best

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,040
decision that we can make
