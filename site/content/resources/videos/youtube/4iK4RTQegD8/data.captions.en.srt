1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,440
legacy systems you've got them they work

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,280
mostly but they're slow expensive and

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,559
getting in the way of where you need to

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,719
go the problem isn't just the technology

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
it's the way it's wired into everything

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,080
your processes your compliance

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,000
requirement the thousand little

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,039
integrations that nobody remembers

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
setting up that's why modernization

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,000
feels risky because if you pull the

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,480
wrong thread everything unravels

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,200
at Naked Agility we're not here to rip

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,000
and replace we help you understand your

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,640
system not just the code but how work

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
flows through it where the bottlenecks

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
are what's worth fixing what's holding

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,719
you back sometimes the right answer

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,640
isn't a full rewrite maybe it's

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
automation maybe it's incremental

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,360
changes that reduce risk maybe it's

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,320
rethinking how your teams operate so

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,800
you're not constantly firefighting

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,120
whatever it is we help you see the

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,399
bigger picture so you can modernize on

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,159
your terms without grinding everything

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,640
to a halt if you're done sinking money

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,360
into a system that's working against you

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,360
let's talk because modernization

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,680
shouldn't be a gamble it should be a

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
strategy
