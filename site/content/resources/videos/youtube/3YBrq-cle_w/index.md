 The #PSMII or #advancedprofessionalscrummaster course, developed by #scrumorg, has been designed to escalate the knowledge, skills, and capabilities of a #scrummaster to a more advanced, professional level.

Often, that means building on the rock-solid foundation of the #PSM or #professionalscrummaster course, but for some it's a brand new experience with the world of professional #scrum and challenges many of their assumptions about the accountability.

Martin Hinshelwood explains how the #PSMII or Advanced Professional Scrum Master course will take you to the next level.
