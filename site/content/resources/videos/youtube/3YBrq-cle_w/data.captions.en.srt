1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,840
how will a psm-2 class challenge your

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,480
sub assumptions the most I I think

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,640
fundamentally people's assumptions about

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,160
what they think a scrum Master is what

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,859
they think a scrum Master does how they

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
think a scrum Master guides the team the

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,500
number of times that we have to hit on

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,740
those myths of of what scrum what what

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,940
people think scrum Masters are right I

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,700
mean

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,160
um let's discover Masters or jira admins

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,739
that's a good one

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,540
um so realizing they're not a jira admin

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,760
they're not there to solve the team's

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,260
problems right get Get impediments Out

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,539
The Way of the team is apparently the

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,760
scrum Master's problem is like oh no

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,739
they're they're there to cause the

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,600
removal of the impediments

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,640
right which which means they probably

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,739
don't do the work themselves they're

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,260
helping the team do the work themselves

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,539
and effectively doing themselves out of

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,460
a job right you want to be invisibly

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,920
present that's a great phrase that I

26
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,680
love from the from the PSM too is being

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,320
invisibly present right

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,799
um you're there you provide value

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,780
um you help a shape and guide the way

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,960
people are organizing around the work

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,799
but then if you're off for two weeks

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,520
um

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,560
the work still happens if you're

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,020
away for two weeks the retrospective

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,360
still happens the daily scrum still

36
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,700
happens because the people on the team

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,700
understand the value that it provides

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,320
rather than just being told to do it by

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,079
the scrum master and I have to turn up

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,420
and be told what to do right

41
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,060
um that for me is the biggest

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
transition from

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,960
um

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,479
scrum Master into the advanced scrum

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,340
