However, this initial leap - investing 30% upfront in your future - is less about the financial aspect and more about investing in yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>By committing to this payment, you're not just reserving a seat in a training programme; you're affirming to yourself and the world that you're on the move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Here's how you can kickstart the process, turning your current stagnation into acceleration towards the career you're meant to have.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Take a good, hard look at your skills and decide what you need to learn.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Commit</strong>: Decide that you are worth the investment.
