1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,920
so we have we have this this uh program

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,500
I I call it the well I guess it's

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,599
confusingly named under employment

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,940
underemployed

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,440
um unemployed program I kind of change

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,939
the name depending on how I feel that

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,080
day

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:29,099
um and it's a program that allows people

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,080
who either don't have a job right so

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,940
they're they're they're changing careers

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
their

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
um just happen to be made redundant

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,399
right that could be things that happen

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,820
um or if they're in a job that is

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,440
beneath them right that's that's that's

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,120
depending on your your country they're

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,340
gonna calculate

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,480
um unemployment in various different

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,579
ways but most of the major countries uh

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,079
calculate include in unemployment

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,019
figures somebody who is underemployed so

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,580
that is uh your uh you're a nuclear

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,240
physicist and your are currently working

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,619
at McDonald's right you're underemployed

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,479
you should be working somewhere using

26
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,420
your talents and capability that you've

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,520
got but it could be I mean I'm creating

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,979
a a big one there but that could be any

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
you know even even short gaps uh

30
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,259
somebody who is uh normally a project

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
manager who is

32
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,100
working with uh teams or a scrum master

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,540
and

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,520
um they're they're having to do

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,500
something else because they're or jobs

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,299
available in their particular context

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,960
right that's that's the that's the under

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,079
slash unemployed uh program that we have

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,060
and um the reason I created it was

40
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,880
because there are so many people that

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,439
are in that category and they can really

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,119
struggle to afford premium training like

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,399
we're talking about right you want you

44
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,500
want to get your your your your PSM your

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,979
pspo your Advanced whatever it is

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,619
because you think it will enable

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,079
um doors to open for you right we all

48
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,060
know that that certification is not the

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,619
be all and end-all of of knowledge it's

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,200
not a thing

51
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,319
um that that you should rely on right

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,080
but lots of recruiters and companies do

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,000
rely on it and while they do rely on it

54
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,239
it's perhaps something that you could

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,420
add to your cve adds to your story that

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,099
would open a open a door and to enable

57
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,200
you to then have a conversation with

58
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,400
somebody and that's where you are then

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,660
able to shine

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
right and part of that uh um um story is

61
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,440
being able to participate in these

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,599
trainings gain some extra understanding

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,480
and that bit of paper that perhaps

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,040
cracks that that door to get into that

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,840
interview

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,760
um so that you can shine so that's

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,300
that's why I created it

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,480
um if the way it works is

69
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,420
um you go to my website you book a a

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,800
class and instead of paying upfront

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,700
which is what most people are going to

72
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,640
do

73
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,099
um you can pick invoice and then give me

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,780
a call uh give me a chat chat to me

75
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,580
email me whatever

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,580
um and we can have a conversation and

77
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,920
what I do is I just set it as 30 deposit

78
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,239
up front so you pay a little bit right

79
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,239
it's not going to be completely

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,760
completely free I have costs too right

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,159
so there's a 30 deposit up front and

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,060
then you pay the rest when you're ready

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,099
right when you feel uh you're when when

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,000
you've got that job that you want that's

85
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:39,599
paying you the the the rate that you're

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,159
Worth right then you can pay it back

87
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,280
um I've done this a few times with a few

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,900
people I've never had anybody not pay it

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,700
back and most people pay it back fairly

90
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,379
quickly so uh I am always happy to help

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,140

00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,120
