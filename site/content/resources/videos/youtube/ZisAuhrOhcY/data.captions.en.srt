1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,080
I got introduced to cban uh by Daniel

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:12,519
Vante and Steve Porter uh when I did the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,320
the the participated in the first uh

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,359
professional uh scrum with cban class uh

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,359
back in

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:26,560
2018 late 17 early

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:30,880
18 and I didn't fundamentally understand

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:35,120
at the time the value of of this

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,719
different way of thinking of this um

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,120
observational tool I think it's quite

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,760
important to understand that Canan is

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,280
not a system itself that's why uh uh Pro

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,320
Canan and the

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,000
cban guide talks about it as a strategy

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,039
it's a strategy for understanding your

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,440
existing system and then actively

17
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,719
managing the flow of work through that

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,560
existing system

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,119
and we talked about it in that context

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,479
within the context of a scrum team and

21
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,880
how we can manage actively manage the

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,680
flow of work within the system use the

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,280
cambam metric to augment our existing

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,439
perhaps awesome scrum process in order

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
to really understand the predictability

26
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,479
that we're getting and increase that

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
predictability for the business because

28
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,840
lot lots of teams do struggle

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,960
uh with their ability to to to deliver

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,479
they struggle with getting to the end of

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,320
the Sprint and having working product um

32
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,560
they struggle with um consistently

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,479
getting working product they struggle

34
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,799
with the con the quantity of working

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,360
product um and

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,600
that creates fear in the business

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,159
because the business are paying a lot of

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,759
money to get stuff and they feel like

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,200
they're getting that stuff in fits and

40
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,600
starts in an unpredictable way right

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,679
they feel like it's not what they asked

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,959
for it doesn't cost what they thought it

43
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:12,560
would and it's not delivered when they

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,640
thought it would and part of that is

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,200
because they they can't see what's going

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,599
on they can't we're we're not giving

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,840
we're not giving them any information

48
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,280
the standard scrum team is not giving

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,920
the business any information to reassure

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,200
them they're not doing transparency

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,440
right they're not increasing the

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,319
transparency to a level where the people

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,160
viewing who need to understand actually

54
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,239
understand what's going on and that

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,200
creates that fear that means that we

56
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,800
want to have more control right when we

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,400
fear something isn't working out when we

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,480
fear that um our money isn't being spent

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,959
well we want to take more control of

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,680
that thing and that's the knee-jerk

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,840
regression that we get from a lot of

62
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,879
teams in organizations when a lot of

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,280
teams move towards scrum because they

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,840
take away

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,959
uh uh some of the the the the tools for

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,080
measuring productivity from the teams

67
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,680
right um because in agile we don't

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,080
measure productivity they take that

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,720
stuff away but then they don't replace

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,400
it with anything and because they don't

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,640
replace it with anything transparency

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,720
drops fear increases and then we want to

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,000
go back to the old way so a caman

74
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,200
strategy and this is this is something

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,799
that I've learned really over the last

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,439
five years of work working with Daniel

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:39,959
Vante and the the campan guide and uh

78
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:42,560
Pro caman is that the only way to be

79
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,400
successful is to use a caman strategy

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,959
because we need to understand our

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,000
predictability we needs to understand

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,040
and actively manage the flow of work

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,040
through the system and we are not going

84
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,200
to be successful if we don't do that so

85
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,319
I I recommend a cand strategy for any

86
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,599
team

87
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,840
doing anything in any context that's

88
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,120
right any team doing anything in any

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,720
context if you're a marketing team

90
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,200
delivering marketing contents if you're

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,000
a um a software team delivering software

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,000
and you're using scrum you're a software

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,799
team using safe you're a software team

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,960
using something else that you made up

95
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,960
yourself or you're a management team

96
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,840
managing portfolio or I don't know I'm

97
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
trying to think of other things if you

98
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,720
work in a Factory and you're delivering

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,639
stuff you should be using a camand

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:42,120
strategy in all of those contexts that

101
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,720
is the metrics you need in order to then

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,039
be successful right because those

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,120
metrics create transparency transparency

104
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,199
allows you to make better decisions and

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,600
ask more interesting questions and those

106
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,199
interesting questions and better

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,039
decisions result in more effective flow

108
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,680
or stop doing the thing that you thought

109
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:03,479
of um and that's why caman is so

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,720
important to the strategy for every team

111
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,199
building anything in any company if you

112
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560

113
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,600
