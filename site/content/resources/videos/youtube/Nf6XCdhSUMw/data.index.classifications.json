    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of 'customer' or 'customer focus' are sparse (e.g., 'enhancing customer value' is referenced as one of several possible business outcomes), hence a low 'mentions' score. Conceptual alignment is strong: the content genuinely champions using evidence and purposeful metrics to drive decisions and shape behaviors, which aligns with customer-focused agile/DevOps principles (measuring outcomes, informed improvement, and focus on value). Depth is solid: the article explores how evidence-based management affects decision-making, offers practical steps, and warns against data misuse. However, it only occasionally anchors these ideas in customer-centric terms—much discussion centers on internal metrics, team behaviors, and org effectiveness. Intent is generally supportive but not laser-focused on customer outcomes as a primary driver. The content targets practitioners (agile/DevOps/management), generally matching the category's audience. The writing is clear and on-topic, hence a strong signal-to-noise ratio. No penalties were warranted as the material is current, neutral/positive, and on-topic, but customer focus is presented as one value among several, rather than the organizing principle.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the content emphasizes evidence-based management and hints at customer value, it treats customer focus as one of several goals, not the central theme. Its practical depth and relevance earn a moderate-to-high confidence for 'Customer Focus', but low direct mention and primary framing limit a perfect score.",
