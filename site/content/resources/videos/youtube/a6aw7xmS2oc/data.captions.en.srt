1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:10,139
uh what are the top two things that a

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,200
product owner needs to bear in mind when

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,360
adopting the entrepreneur stance

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,180
I kind of think of the the entrepreneur

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
stance as as like the Visionary looking

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,400
forward to the future

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,619
um and that's where a lot of the stuff

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,539
that ends up on your product backlog is

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,160
going to be this is just one part of

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,239
being a product owner

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:37,320
and I think the the two most important

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:41,340
things to focus on and one is connecting

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,820
the team to uh the value that you're

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,040
creating does everybody on the team

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,600
understand

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,760
the connection between the work they're

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,320
doing every day and what it is we're

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,300
trying to achieve do they understand

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,300
that connection so that that would be a

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,000
lot around uh Vision communicating it

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,739
product goal communicating it Sprint

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
goals right making that connection

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,280
between the work that's happening every

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,500
day I think that's probably one of the

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,500
most important things and the most

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,360
common lacking things

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,720
um the other one is where the value

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,240
comes from uh one of the things that I

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,880
find when I engage with product owners

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
the first thing I ask them is is how do

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,740
you decide what's valuable and what

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,500
isn't and quite off often the answer is

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,400
I make it up as I go along right which

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,299
which

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,700
uh while not necessarily 100 wrong a lot

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,840
of people have very good

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,700
um guts skills at reading the the

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,740
reading the market reading the

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,560
information that they have

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,960
um but really we want to be taking a

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,700
more evidence-based approach

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,320
so from a product owner's perspective

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,939
are you making decisions

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,979
based on

45
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,020
information

46
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,700
do you even have the information that

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,439
you can get there's going to be lots of

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,740
hidden stuff right we're still taking

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,599
bets we're still taking risks

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,900
um but

51
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,520
do you have enough information to make

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,040
more of the right decisions and less of

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,660
the wrong decisions uh so for that I

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,540
usually look towards Evan's base

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,420
management right making sure that I

56
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,360
understand my my current value I have in

57
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,700
the system like uh our product that's

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,700
our current value puts features already

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,319
in there and our unrealized value what

60
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,120
are the stuff that we need to have in

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,420
our system that we haven't built yet so

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,640
kind of looking forward into the future

63
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,300
but I also really considering our our

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,379
our other more organizational capability

65
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,459
focused metrics where I'm gathering data

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,200
from

67
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,360
um both our our ability to innovate

68
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,540
right how much time do we spend on net

69
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,300
new things versus existing things it's

70
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,120
that's the same reason that

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,060
um uh we all get upset that Netflix is

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,940
canceling our you know favorite show

73
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,180
right because they do a season and the

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,860
numbers are good but they're not amazing

75
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,959
and if they're not amazing they know

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,280
that the second season is going to be

77
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,319
less amazing than the first season

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,780
because it just always is

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,519
so they would rather invest that same

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,920
money they would invest in doing a

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,340
second season of existing show into

82
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,319
doing a first season of a brand new show

83
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,659
that might be more likely to get a

84
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,180
higher return on investment for that for

85
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,500
that first show right we get all upset

86
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,900
because they cancel our favorite show

87
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,060
with their favorite characters right but

88
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,220
in reality they're making commercial

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,019
decisions based on the data and the

90
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,760
analytics that they're collecting from

91
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,440
who's watching all the shows and how

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,299
they're doing it you need to do that as

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,099
a product owner right that's the product

94
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,500
owner making those decisions based on

95
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,840
the data so you've got your your ability

96
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,360
to innovate and then you've also got

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,519
your your time to market right how

98
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,980
quickly can you go from

99
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,500
same for Netflix as well right how

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,599
quickly can you go from an idea to

101
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,580
getting that thing in front of real

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,040
users who are then able to give you

103
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,959
feedback right how quickly can you get

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,900
stuff in front of them and I think

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,419
that's that's if you think in the in the

106
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,880
in the in the movie TV show space that's

107
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:25,919
why we're seeing so many limited series

108
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,340
now

109
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,440
um and that's because

110
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,419
we are unhappy with that false sense of

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,180
we're getting more later

112
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,620
right we're getting a second season and

113
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,940
we're hoping for a second season and

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,860
then we don't get it whereas if they

115
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,720
Market it to us as it's a limited series

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,460
we're only making one

117
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,320
if it's if something happens we might

118
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,180
make that but we're only making one then

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,940
we don't have that sense of loss as

120
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,820
users and that's product ownership right

121
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,919
they're managing our expectations

122
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,919
they're looking at where the next piece

123
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,080
of value is coming from how can we get

124
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,919
different users increase our market

125
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,080
share into our product uh and and really

126
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:08,759
understanding value and how it impacts

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,300
on that and the decisions that you make

128
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,759
get the data in there as well that was
