    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses the differences between resource efficiency and flow efficiency, which aligns closely with the tenet of 'flow efficiency over resource efficiency' in Agile methodologies. It provides a detailed exploration of these concepts and their implications for team productivity and decision-making. The text references actionable insights about balancing both efficiencies, which is relevant to guiding behaviours within an organisation. However, it does not strongly emphasize a particular tenet as a doctrine or rule, leading to a lower confidence score despite the strong conceptual alignment.",

While it touches on themes related to Agile processes, the focus is more on comparing two forms of efficiency rather than on achieving or nurturing capabilities that enhance organizational performance. The depth of discussion is somewhat limited to definitions and implications of resource vs. flow efficiency, lacking a thorough exploration of capability development or measurement, which are central to the capability category.",
