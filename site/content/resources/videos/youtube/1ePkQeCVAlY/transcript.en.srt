1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,179
oh that's a great question so so the

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,460
question is what's the difference

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,660
between resource efficiency and flow

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,360
efficiency

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,539
and and first off I I do want to say

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,560
that that most organizations and most

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:26,640
teams focus on resource efficiency

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,519
um that's where uh you worry more about

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,500
your access to materials with people

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
being considered materials in this case

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,719
right people are resources

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,020
and we want to optimize the amount of

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,120
time that they spend doing the thing as

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,280
if they're machines in a factory that

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,320
you're paying a rent for right you're

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,899
paying maintenance for and you want to

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
maximize the output of of of of that

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,820
machine

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,640
um unfortunately in in in our world of

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,739
of complexity

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,300
um we're not doing the same thing over

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,199
and over and over again like a machine

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,540
does so we can't optimize with with

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,880
patterns in that way I mean there are

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,500
patterns we can optimize with but not

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,460
not in the same way that we can with

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
machines

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,700
so when you focus on on resource

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,979
efficiency

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,200
with a group of people you end up with

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,360
feature factories you end up with

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,700
unhappy people you end up with high

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,140
staff turnover right because people

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,580
don't really care about your company

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,619
they don't really care about what you're

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,680
trying to do and they feel like you're

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,000
not rewarding them for the expertise and

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,740
capabilities they're bringing to your

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,119
organization so they'll be like well

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,619
I'll go somewhere else that's offering

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,200
me more money or I'll go somewhere else

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,540
because I don't like you anymore or my

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,340
boss sucks or whatever it is

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,280
whereas in a flow efficiency environment

45
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,200
you're looking holistically at the flow

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,979
of work through the system

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,340
rather than optimizing any particular

48
00:01:54,979 --> 00:02:01,680
resource right a great example of that I

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,619
think is in organizations that have

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,640
sales teams quite often they optimize

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:10,800
sales for leads and more work coming

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,540
into the system but you don't actually

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,900
have the capability to deliver work

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,420
deliver that work in the system so sales

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,920
is overselling and then the engineering

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,660
teams need to suffer because they have

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,819
to try and deliver within the bounds of

58
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,580
of of that world of we're under high

59
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,500
pressure we can't actually

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,879
solve the problems that we want to solve

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,620
we've just got to get stuff out the door

62
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,440
get it done get it finished

63
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,200
and that doesn't breed

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,500
happy people or

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,260
um you know it doesn't break the craft

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,060
craftsmanship or crafts person ship I

67
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,220
don't know if that's a word but that

68
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,860
that idea that

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,319
um I want to be good at what I do I want

70
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,120
there to be value in what I do I want to

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,800
understand

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,599
uh uh um what it is that I'm trying to

73
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,099
achieve and why it matters right what's

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
the work I'm doing and how does it

75
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,360
matter to the overall organization so

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,819
flow efficiency tries to look at

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,540
holistically across

78
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:13,319
um the the flow of work right are we

79
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,879
optimizing in the right areas are we

80
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,080
able to

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,080
um see that when we increase the

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,780
um what would you call it

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,540
if we if we optimize this reach this one

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,459
resource what effect does it actually

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,500
have on the rest of the system

86
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,599
right what does effect does it have down

87
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,340
the down the line if we optimize for for

88
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,620
software engineering the developers are

89
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,720
churning out stuff and we've got testers

90
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,220
as a separate entity here are are they

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,420
then overburdened and then it looks like

92
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,739
they're the problem and we're all

93
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,819
blaming the testers for not getting

94
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,280
stuff done

95
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,220
so flow efficiency is about looking

96
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,299
holistically across the system

97
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,340
understanding the flow of work through

98
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,560
that system and how do we optimize to

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,720
maximize the value that we're delivering

100
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,260
through the system

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,080
resource uh uh efficiency is looking at

102
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,760
um how do we deliver more stuff we just

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,620
need more stuff

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,500
right whether that's

105
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,720
projects finished or it's widgets in a

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,760
factory or whatever it is that's that's

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,540
a resource efficiency versus flow

108
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,540
efficiency Loop
