    "reasoning": "The content focuses on immersive training for Scrum Masters, emphasizing practical application, leadership, and continuous improvement in agile contexts. While it loosely references agency (team empowerment, value delivery, leadership), it does not discuss agentic engineering, deliberate engineering design for human/AI agency, or relevant systemic/ethical/DevOps practices. There are no direct mentions or in-depth conceptual exploration of agentic engineering. Alignment is partial due to shared themes of autonomy and continuous value delivery, but the discussion remains generic to agile and professional development. The content's audience (practicing Scrum Masters) overlaps, and signal is moderately strong for professional growth, not for agentic engineering itself.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on Scrum Master training and leadership in agile, with minor, indirect links to themes of agency. It does not specifically address agentic engineering, deliberate system design, or AI/human agency and thus only partially aligns with the category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is focused exclusively on immersive training for Scrum Masters, emphasizing leadership, facilitation, and practical skills improvement. There are no explicit mentions or substantive discussions of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, or integration between AI and human expertise. None of the key topics—such as AI autonomy in delivery, feedback loops driven by agents, or agent-enabled practices—are present. Audience and intent are centered on human Scrum Masters, not agentic systems. While some tangential ideas (e.g., maximizing value, continuous improvement) overlap with agile delivery principles, they do not engage with the agentic paradigm. Therefore, fit with the category is minimal.",
