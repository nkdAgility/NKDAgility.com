1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:10,160
so what we don't need is any more scrum

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:13,320
Masters that don't have the experience

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,759
and understanding to be able to help the

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,359
teams that they work with uh we don't

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,720
need any more scrum Masters that

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,359
actively inhibit the maximization of

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,560
value and the effectiveness of teams

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:32,759
because of their lack of knowledge and I

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:36,399
think the scrum Master immersive class

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,000
is a perfect opportunity for people who

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,840
are aspiring to be scrum

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,960
Masters to truly try and understand what

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,600
it takes to be a scrum Master now now

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,559
don't get me wrong if you're if you're

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
thinking of being a scrum master and

16
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,320
you're not actually a scrum Master yet

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,039
the immersive class is probably not

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,640
going to work out very well for you

19
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,479
mainly because you as an aspiring scrum

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Master are going to have difficulty in

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
enacting and working through the

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,520
assignments which are specifically

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,520
designed for people who are already

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,159
working as a scrum Master regardless of

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,840
their knowledge level already working as

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,280
a scrum master and um focus on them

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,079
becoming more effective at what they do

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,079
at helping their teams be more effective

29
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:37,360
so really um if you're um looking to be

30
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,079
a scrum Master then uh probably the

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,840
immersive class is not for you but if

32
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,119
you are already a scrum Master

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,000
regardless of your skill level then the

34
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,759
immersive class is an absolute perfect

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,119
fit to enable you to really deepen the

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,439
knowledge that you need to perhaps

37
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,680
become a great scrum Master if you want

38
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,920
to have a discussion about how immersive

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,280
classes can revolutionize your training
