3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,799
are already a member of your Azure

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,340
Active Directory so that's not gonna

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,640
work for students or for for me what you

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,400
need to do is you need to go to the team

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,289
so to be the team here and then you have

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:32,579
to add a member and if you put in Martin

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,370
at nkd agility comm it'll come up well

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,160
mine says I can't find any matches but

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,350
yours should come up and say an

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,910
invitation let me copy your email I

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:51,690
don't know what the emails are for your

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:54,750
Azure Active Directory but this will

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:01,500
come up and say at guest so I can click

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:05,309
Add Oh awesome so mine's messed up

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,840
because your email address something

18
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,650
weird is going on with that that I might

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,590
have to fix so I'm gonna go into the

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,509
admin system and try and fix that so I

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,700
can add you in there but that's how you

22
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,170
do that you have to hit add members I

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,200
when I'm inviting students to the class

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,320
if I get them up front and I use our

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,689
power shell script that loads the excel

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,479
sheet with all the students in it and

27
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:37,670
I'll load them all in to Azure DevOps

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,380
and does your DevOps to the system

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,540
active directory for authentication and

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,360
instead of them getting the automated

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,030
email I take their I build their

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,759
invitation links and then I load that

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,939
into MailChimp so they get an email from

34
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,530
me like you know like course email that

35
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,100
just has that here accept this

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,649
invitation clickable link in there and

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,869
then they are authenticated with Active

38
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,880
Directory and then they can get into the

39
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,099
team but if you just add them on teams

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,080
they'll get an invitation I wanted you

41
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,050
to see the invitation email so I'll try

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,610
and go and fix that so you can get

43
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,610
the invitation email okay
