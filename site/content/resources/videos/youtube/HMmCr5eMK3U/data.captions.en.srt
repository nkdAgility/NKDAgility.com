69
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,759

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,800
how people answered

75
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
bye

76
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,519
there we go everybody everybody's back

77
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,360
in the main room

78
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,920
awesome

79
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,279
how how how did you get on was that

80
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,279
were they quite difficult questions

81
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,680
no i i anna anna two is shaking her head

82
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,160
like nope those were easy

83
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,440
okay i think we got stuck on one but it

84
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,759
was good

85
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,759
yeah it's it's um

86
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,680
i think

87
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,600
definition of done

88
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:29,120
is something that is often

89
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,560
misunderstood and often confused or

90
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,079
conflated

91
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
with acceptance criteria

92
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,839
victoria i just popped you on uh mute uh

93
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,360
there just there was some background

94
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,079
noise popping in

95
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,440
uh just a note that ev everybody has

96
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,079
permission

97
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,639
to pop other people on mute

98
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,199
um so if you do hear a lot of background

99
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,440
noise it's okay to go to mute that

100
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,120
person uh but um

101
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,320
if you just don't like what they're

102
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,360
saying it's not okay to go put them on

103
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,839
mute

104
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
okay that's not a good reason to to put

105
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,520
me we're not allowed to meet you

106
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,280
you you can if you want you can if you

107
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,280
want and uh

108
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,079
and i can kinda can take over

109
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,520
that's right

110
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,720
so what

111
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,160
were there any

112
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,160
contentious discussions

113
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,679
in your room i got a couple of things

114
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:35,440
that i want to to to hit on because this

115
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,440
like 50 50 between the rooms

116
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,679
i think number four

117
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,799
number four

118
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
we we don't have to conform to any

119
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,919
standards

120
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,640
we don't like standards what's this get

121
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,039
these standards off me

122
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,520
that's that's

123
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,760
i think

124
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
standards are something that should be

125
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,080
built into any process

126
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,799
for everything we're doing

127
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,880
right too many standards might end up

128
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,320
being bureaucracy

129
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,840
so you need to be careful of that

130
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,360
balance

131
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,440
but having standards is a good idea

132
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,160
definition of done is one of those

133
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
standards um that we should have that is

134
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,559
a good idea

135
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,480
um

136
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,480
does anybody know what the scrum guides

137
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,240
says about definition of done

138
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
and where it comes from

139
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,919
eight i know you do

140
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,480
i think it's a

141
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,440
responsibility it's a responsibility of

142
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,160
income but sorry

143
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
we'll say it again

144
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,919
so um i've got a a little phrase here

145
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
i'm just gonna bring it in um it's

146
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,360
straight off oh well i put it on a

147
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
post-it that's probably not the best

148
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,799
place to put it i should have put it on

149
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,880
a text box let me change that to a text

150
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,919
box and then i can make the text bigger

151
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,360
there we go

152
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
well except i paused that

153
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,080
is that where did that go it magically

154
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
disappeared i will get a new one

155
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,160
let me make it bigger

156
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
there we go i've just put it off to the

157
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,280
to the to the bottom of our

158
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,120
um

159
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,799
start up and it says

160
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,440
if the definition of done for an

161
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,160
increment is part of the standards of

162
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,480
the organization

163
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,760
all scrum teams must follow it as a

164
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,799
minimum

165
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,960
so that for me implies two things

166
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,440
it implies that your organization should

167
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,240
have some kind of standard

168
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,720
for what your definition of done is

169
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,240
and it also implies that the team the

170
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,600
scrum team can add more things

171
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,600
than the minimum requirement

172
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,200
right so if you think about

173
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,240
definition of done should be applied

174
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,280
equally across your entire organization

175
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,360
so there might be things that you don't

176
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
put on that list because you can't apply

177
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,760
them across everything

178
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,440
and then each team depending on what

179
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,440
they're building

180
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,080
are going to have individual things they

181
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,120
have to add i'm thinking of an example

182
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,919
uh and i i think a good one is um let's

183
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,159
say you're an organization who

184
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,000
makes printers

185
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,000
but also makes pacemakers

186
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,200
right

187
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,120
the pacemakers

188
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
need to comply with a bunch of

189
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,280
regulations that printers do not

190
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,000
right the the the the

191
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,600
somebody has to i guess medical within

192
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,559
your country there'll be some medical

193
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,640
body

194
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,640
that imposes restrictions upon you

195
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,760
there'll be an iso standard for that

196
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,880
absolutely and there are a lot of iso

197
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,240
standards

198
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,960
which ones apply to your organization

199
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,000
uh there might be standards around

200
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,720
um

201
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,400
financial information

202
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
one that i've had to combat with a

203
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,600
number of times

204
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,480
is no matter where you are in the world

205
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,679
if you build software

206
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,320
that somebody in an organization that's

207
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,799
listed on the new york stock exchange

208
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,840
makes a financial decision

209
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,799
based on information you present them

210
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,960
your software must comply with sox audit

211
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,000
sars van oxley which is an absolute

212
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,960
nightmare

213
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,360
but you have to provide that data that

214
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,360
information that ability to see what's

215
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,600
going on it's about traceability of who

216
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,559
made the decision uh

217
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,320
and and what the data showed them uh in

218
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,720
order to have that traceability in case

219
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,280
something's wrong right

220
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,120
so that might be imposed upon us we have

221
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,280
no choice if we want to build software

222
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,919
in a particular market we have to comply

223
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,919
with standards

224
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,679
so it's okay for those things to be

225
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,799
imposed from the outside because they

226
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
might just be reality

227
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,080
uh another one i noticed that we we had

228
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,360
a little bit of two teams put a red

229
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,919
uh put across and two teams put a tick

230
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,039
and that was all technical debt is a

231
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,039
risk to the business

232
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:39,880
that's a phrase i've used before i kind

233
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,880
of kind of stuck snuck that one in there

234
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,880
is one technically that the risk or is

235
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,600
not paying it off or risk

236
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,039
it

237
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,799
well it's not not paying off continues

238
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
the risk

239
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,640
right so if you if you have money on

240
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,720
your credit card

241
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,559
that you've not paid off yet

242
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,799
it is a risk

243
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,039
even if you have the money to pay it off

244
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,720
at the end of the month something might

245
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,520
happen that makes it

246
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,000
dangerous right

247
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:17,679
um so it is a it is a risk all debt is a

248
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
risk i have a mortgage on my house

249
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,760
right if i can't pay that mortgage each

250
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,760
month i lose my house don't i

251
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,559
so there's risk there

252
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,559
and that that

253
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,679
debt

254
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,039
is secured against my house so i i'm not

255
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,120
i'm not going to

256
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,919
lose money i'm gonna get the money back

257
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,919
that i put into the house

258
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,440
but what is the technical debt in your

259
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
products secured against

260
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,840
who ensures

261
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,840
the technical debt in your product

262
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,480
nobody does it's completely unsecured

263
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,480
risk

264
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,360
that's a business risk isn't it if you

265
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,360
have unsecured risk that's that's

266
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,880
a big risk of the business

267
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,919
the problem is the business doesn't

268
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
understand that risk

269
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,799
so they don't know it's there because

270
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,320
you know we don't tell them

271
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,080
we don't have that conversation with

272
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,200
them about

273
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
well

274
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
you know i know you wanted you spent 100

275
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,600
000 on this product but actually you

276
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,919
know we didn't run all of the tests

277
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,919
every sprint

278
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
you know there's some features in there

279
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,799
that you know maybe they work

280
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,799
we don't know maybe they don't

281
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,720
what risk is that to the business

282
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,600
yeah

283
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,679
it depends how you think about the

284
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
question isn't it

285
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,799
i'm just triggered by the old technique

286
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,960
because sometimes not getting

287
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,720
technically depth is a huge risk as well

288
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
if you cannot ship

289
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,240
a new

290
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,080
so

291
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,919
it's not what i'm saying paying it off

292
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,039
as long as you highlight that you have

293
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,279
technical debt and plan to fix it

294
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,240
next sprint

295
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,880
the risk of not doing

296
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
reduces

297
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,600
yes but it only reduces the risk it

298
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,520
doesn't make it zero risk

299
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,720
the fact that it exists

300
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,880
is risk

301
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,320
your business might have decided to

302
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,480
accept

303
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,440
a certain level of risk

304
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,840
in order to meet the time constraints of

305
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
shipping in a market

306
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,520
right we've got to get some our

307
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,640
competitors have done something

308
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,039
we must be able to meet that constraint

309
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,200
we can't have our usual level of quality

310
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,480
because there's not enough time

311
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
and we have to get it out there

312
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,240
otherwise we're out of business we're

313
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,559
hemorrhaging customers

314
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,760
right so you might reduce quality to

315
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,799
meet that

316
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
there's technical debt

317
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,600
but we have to pay it back it's still

318
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,440
risk

319
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,320
that that i think is what i'm getting at

320
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,559
it it might be acceptable risk

321
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,600
but it still needs to be be quantifiable

322
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,360
as as risk

323
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,760
and we have a

324
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,640
short debate on this in my meeting room

325
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
that basically said everything

326
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,840
everything we've ever done has always

327
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,000
gone live there's some level of

328
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,960
technical risk you know a perfect piece

329
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,919
of software does not exist yeah you know

330
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,240
no matter how even even for pacemakers

331
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,520
you know there will be not necessarily

332
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,799
technical decks i think there will

333
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,919
probably be no technical debt there

334
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,919
because someone would have fixed the

335
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,000
problem that what they've got is a much

336
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,520
worse scenario which is they have

337
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,279
probably got bugs in that they don't

338
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,279
know about um

339
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,960
we're actually going live with bugs you

340
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,279
do know about and some are accepting

341
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,360
that and then deciding when if at all to

342
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,520
pay that officer is a i would suggest a

343
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
better a better view of the world

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,799
you know because you may deprecate that

345
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,320
bit of the product

346
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,799
before you need to pay the debt off so

347
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,320
why do that why not why not invest the

348
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,039
fixed money

349
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,880
in

350
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,840
make a better product money

351
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,799
yes

352
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,919
absolutely and and i agree

353
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,720
um

354
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,880
except under certain circumstances

355
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,880
what level of risk would you be happy

356
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,320
with peter for bowing

357
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,520
in there in their products they create

358
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,039
right

359
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,960
what if if you were the one with the

360
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,320
pacemaker what level of risk would you

361
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,919
be willing to accept so the way it tends

362
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,399
to work

363
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
is there is that level of risk there is

364
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,720
that reality

365
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,840
of cost versus benefit

366
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,520
and as long as you and your team

367
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,039
have done everything within your power

368
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,120
to make

369
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,880
to minimize

370
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,279
any risk to the level that's allowed

371
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,080
then you've done a good job

372
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,000
right

373
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,559
there always might be the circumstance

374
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,279
that a plane will fall out the sky

375
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,840
right that that we can't have that zero

376
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,000
it's not zero it is something

377
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,559
the the example i i usually use for that

378
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,360
peter is the the the food and drug

379
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:22,320
authority in the us

380
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,080
stipulates exactly how many insect legs

381
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,880
are allowed

382
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,640
per

383
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,960
i don't know how what power quantity may

384
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,720
be per ounce of food that you buy in the

385
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,159
supermarket how many insect legs are

386
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,720
allowed because zero is impossible

387
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,559
right because insects are everywhere you

388
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,120
can't have zero

389
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,600
so you have to specify and i think it's

390
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,480
it's it's two parts per million or it's

391
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
three

392
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,320
three legs per kilo of food or

393
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,919
what whatever it is there is a standard

394
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,760
for that

395
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,399
that has been defined as an acceptable

396
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,399
level of risk

397
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,840
but because

398
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,559
because i actually heard the guy who

399
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,440
invented the airbags

400
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,080
going on and saying um airbags with

401
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,760
american airbags need to stop a 200

402
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,679
pound linebacker whatever the hell one

403
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,679
of those is um

404
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
but the risk is they'll kill little old

405
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,559
men

406
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
and at the time he was saying this he

407
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,120
was about 70 something 80s like yeah and

408
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,480
he was there's a little man who might

409
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
well get kicked

410
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,919
yeah it's just an acceptable level of

411
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,360
risk we just agree that some people are

412
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,200
not going to come off as well as they

413
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,919
ought to if their outback goes off

414
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
because we have to stop big people

415
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
so uh

416
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,520
maybe a different way of doing that

417
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,640
would be to weigh the person

418
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,720
that's in the in the in the seat

419
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
and calibrate the airbag based on the

420
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,200
weight and they do do that to a certain

421
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,919
extent for example if i put a baby seat

422
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,240
in my passenger seat of my car

423
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,799
the airbag will not deploy because they

424
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,640
are not heavy enough

425
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,039
to trigger the airbag deployment level

426
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,760
right so they do all sorts of things to

427
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,200
mitigate that risk they do what they can

428
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,840
but there's a certain point at which

429
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,840
they can't do anymore

430
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
so i think we need to

431
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,880
we need to introduce

432
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,720
um a little discussion about the

433
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,279
difference between

434
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,399
acceptance criteria

435
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,399
and definition of done

436
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,600
i know

437
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,960
some of you are

438
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,799
veterans

439
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,399
of that conversation

440
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,600
okay i'm looking at you of you're

441
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,440
definitely a veteran of that

442
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,399
conversation

443
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,159
but it is something that both anna and i

444
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,880
encounter

445
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,760
all the time in organizations

446
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,159
which is a lot of confusion

447
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,440
what's our definition of done

448
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,360
for this backlog item

449
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,840
right it's something that i hear quite

450
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,760
often in organizations

451
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,039
has anybody heard that

452
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,200
i have

453
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,480
wolf's nodding

454
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
yeah

455
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,840
peter have you not heard that ever

456
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,399
no no

457
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,360
it's getting more and more common

458
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,000
if definition is universal

459
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,760
i heard what what what is a what is

460
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,279
applicable

461
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,279
within the definition of done for this

462
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,760
background lesson that that debate i've

463
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,039
heard and what does all documentation up

464
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,480
to date mean yep that no no one's argued

465
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,720
to talk about whether there is a

466
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,559
different definition of done

467
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,519
well we are we are going to have a

468
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,720
little uh exercise around this and i

469
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,720
we're we're going to introduce uh

470
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
a hypothetical organization and product

471
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,559
right and we're going completely

472
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,039
non-technical on this one we've got a

473
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,039
bakery

474
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,000
and in our bakery uh we make uh some

475
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
products

476
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,320
uh we actually make two products in our

477
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,399
bakery this is a startup so we only have

478
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,080
two products at the moment

479
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,159
one of which is

480
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,200
baguettes

481
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,000
and the other one is

482
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,600
banana bread because i don't know i

483
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,799
think anna likes banana bread that's

484
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,799
that's why we're good but i

485
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,559
so acceptance criteria

486
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,600
are

487
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,080
the

488
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,399
business require part of the business

489
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,320
requirements

490
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,840
for the thing that's on your back clock

491
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,399
so if you were thinking about it in the

492
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,840
perspective of user stories

493
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,919
right you've got user stories and

494
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,760
acceptance criteria

495
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,480
and the acceptance criteria is really

496
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,000
the conversation you have a story you

497
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,600
talk about the story you have a

498
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,960
conversation you record the things

499
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,399
the business things that you've been

500
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,320
talking about around that conversation

501
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,279
right as you're discussing that backlog

502
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,240
item

503
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,519
so yes you do have unique acceptance

504
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,519
criteria

505
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,760
for each backlog item

506
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
and the acceptance criteria for for one

507
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,679
backup item might look nothing like

508
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,080
the other

509
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,559
backlog item but peter is right

510
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,120
definition of done applies to everything

511
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,120
equally

512
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,919
okay it should apply to every single

513
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,000
thing on your backlog should be able to

514
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,399
meet the definition of done but again

515
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,919
you might have to you know is document

516
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,240
it uh you might have to have

517
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,559
conversation on each definition of done

518
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,320
like what what does that mean

519
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,159
within the context

520
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,880
of that item

521
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,440
so what i i have here is i have

522
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,120
uh a a number of uh

523
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,120
statements

524
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,120
statements things

525
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,760
here uh let's see how many people do we

526
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,960
have we have 16 people

527
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,919
16 people into groups of

528
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,840
three

529
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,080
goes how many times somebody who's good

530
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,720
at math needs to

531
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,720
help me out

532
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,159
five

533
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,320
but thank you very much for that i wish

534
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,320
by this

535
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,919
my math just sucks sucks really badly so

536
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,919
i'll do five

537
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,639
four five rooms

538
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,159
i'm okay with the and a bit i am of you

539
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,720
can go half in one room and half in the

540
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,000
other room or is it 25 in each room

541
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,800
something like there we go we've got

542
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
four

543
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,639
uh and then three three three

544
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,000
so that works

545
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,200
oh

546
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,520
but in fact i need to go find anna would

547
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,240
you like to go into a room anna with the

548
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,000
group yeah yeah

549
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,280
well that will that will that will solve

550
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,520
that problem so what i'd like you to do

551
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,159
is a little at card sort

552
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,679
and in each room i'll summon everybody

553
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,200
so we're all looking at the same thing

554
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,560
there we go

555
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,520
in each room

556
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
we have

557
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,440
baguettes

558
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,280
banana bread and done

559
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,359
there are cards

560
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,280
that are to do with baguettes cards that

561
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,040
are to do with banana bread and cards

562
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
that are to do with done

563
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,280
so hopefully in your room you've got

564
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,400
somebody who's ever baked something

565
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
right

566
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
because

567
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,280
we have a list of ingredients that might

568
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,000
be part of each of these items and i

569
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,320
felt it was fairly obvious

570
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,880
which ingredients go in banana bread and

571
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,800
which ingredients go in baguettes

572
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,640
but i that could be an assumption

573
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,599
because i bake

574
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,720
my grandmother taught me to bake

575
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,720
so we have

576
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,760
lots of different things

577
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,400
um and how much of each thing

578
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,800
you would put in each type of product i

579
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
think if you think logically we've got a

580
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
savory bread and we've got cake

581
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,079
right

582
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,000
we should we should be able to figure

583
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,599
out which things go where uh but then

584
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,640
there are some things that should apply

585
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,079
to absolutely everything

586
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,359
um so again go to the the room

587
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,119
that matches uh your

588
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,599
the the the room that matches your room

589
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,079
number uh when you get into

590
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,880
um your group

591
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,040
okay

592
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,359
so i've clicked open so i'll give you

593
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
five minutes to sort these so just do a

594
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,839
quick a quick sort and let's see if we

595
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:21,320
manage to to to get them

596
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,320
in the right place

597
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,440
okay i set everybody off i know you guys

598
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
are still

599
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,400
here watching me

600
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,200
uh

601
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,560
so

602
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,119
for you

603
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,359
there are um

604
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,599
should be it should be fairly obvious at

605
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,960
which things go in which category if i

606
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,280
if i zoom in a little bit i'm going to

607
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,160
release everybody so i can zoom in there

608
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,920
we go

609
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,280
so a couple of things uh where are the

610
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,119
things that are uh a kitchen was clean

611
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
at time of preparation

612
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
right

613
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
that's definitely done

614
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,760
uh and all ingredients

615
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,440
used were fresh

616
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,640
right that's done

617
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,280
but then

618
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,240
you know we've got things that that

619
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,800
banana bread uses plain flour

620
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,160
baguettes use bleached flour so white

621
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,320
flour

622
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,880
right banana bread doesn't rise like

623
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,160
bread does bread need yeast so you put

624
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,599
yeast and bread but banana bread uh

625
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,440
you'll probably put some bicarbonate of

626
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,960
soda you're gonna put sweet things in

627
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,560
there so the buttermilk you can see in

628
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
room five they've got the buttermilk in

629
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,280
there um

630
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,280
and

631
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
yeah so you're i can't remember whether

632
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,040
actually it's three grams of salt for

633
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,200
banana bread or 10 grams of salt but

634
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,359
they've decided it's 10 for baguettes

635
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,359
and three and a half for banana bread i

636
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,040
think that makes sense

637
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,760
um we're going to use eggs and banana

638
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,720
bread but we don't put eggs in baguettes

639
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,060
right

640
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,240
um

641
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,520
[Music]

642
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,599
we use butter in cake

643
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,520
and caster sugar yes there's more things

644
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,400
in definitely more things than banana

645
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,560
bread

646
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
um than there are in

647
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:15,359
um

648
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880
i'm experimenting with my camera

649
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,720
in case you were wondering why it's

650
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,880
doing that uh

651
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,920
captain scarlett and the mistrans

652
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,800
flicker

653
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,359
i have a little tool installed in obs

654
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,599
that changes the camera based on where

655
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,280
i'm looking so if i look for long enough

656
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,970
at this camera over here it's going to

657
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
switch to that camera um

658
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:36,480
[Music]

659
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
and then when i look over here it's

660
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
going to switch back

661
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,440
i'm still working and tweaking

662
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,839
how

663
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
that works and the sensitivity of it but

664
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,280
it does seem to be it seems to be

665
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,119
working right so basically it's fate

666
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,160
detecting my face

667
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,160
um

668
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,920
so we'll see how that works let's see

669
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,520
what we've got

670
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,040
we are gonna bring them back in just

671
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,880
a moment

672
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,200
uh if you're on the

673
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
team's team for making breakout rooms

674
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
i'd like a little timer for how long the

675
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,160
rooms have been open

676
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,599
on each of the each of the rooms maybe

677
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,200
that would be handy

678
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,359
so i can see because i can see room

679
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,000
threes done

680
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,839
room one's done

681
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,680
ah there's five rooms so room six isn't

682
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,760
let's see there we go it did the switch

683
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,480
but it went ah

684
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,640
done like captain scarlet number ones

685
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,880
maybe i'm too old

686
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,960
but if i look here it switches back once

687
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,800
i i don't i don't get why it does that

688
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,280
i'll need to check the settings and

689
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,280
figure it out

690
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,880
so i think it's about time to bring

691
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
everybody back

692
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,079
it is

693
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,280
um oh nervous is following me let me un

694
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,319
follow narissa and then over here

695
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,760
let me remove that i have a i have an

696
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,119
answers

697
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,079
grid

698
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,040
uh baguettes take more salt 10 grams of

699
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,000
salt

700
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,680
yeast

701
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,040
olive oil

702
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,240
water

703
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,760
and strong white flour there we go that

704
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,240
was what was on there

705
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,760
so it's four four two and like nine so

706
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,920
it looks like most people are getting

707
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
there room three is not sure what's room

708
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,040
three

709
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,040
yeah they're putting all the salt in

710
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,440
baguettes

711
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,599
but they've got the yeast the flour

712
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,720
cool olive oil so

713
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,079
they're not putting any salt in the

714
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,079
banana bread

715
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,000
is uh

716
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,000
what they're doing so that's okay well

717
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,599
let's close the rooms that is pretty

718
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,079
good

719
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,839
uh click those they get a little warning

720
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,240
and then they'll pop back in just a

721
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,240
second

722
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,240
doing that a lot recently but just

723
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,240
guessing so uh

724
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,040
need to make this harder

725
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,240
oh

726
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,079
almost

727
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,240
every team got it perfect what did you

728
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,240
think

729
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,119
with anna cards

730
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,359
and there were some

731
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,560
i saw kind of a pattern

732
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,560
um

733
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,440
they were just thinking about

734
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,319
um

735
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,119
what does apply to both

736
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,480
but not in term in terms of

737
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,680
standards

738
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,839
right

739
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,319
yeah that's a that's a good caveat and i

740
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,680
can see that's happened in

741
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,800
room four

742
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,440
so in room

743
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,760
room room that was the room you were

744
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,680
um and in room four we're gonna put

745
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,720
370 milliliters of water

746
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,599
in both banana bread and baguettes

747
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,920
i'll tell you now that will not work

748
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,920
that that will not have the the outcome

749
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,599
you're expecting you'll have a banana

750
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,680
bread drink

751
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,240
at that uh uh that level of uh water

752
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,119
um and we don't put eggs in baguettes we

753
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,960
don't put uh eggs in bread

754
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,599
um

755
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,119
so that's that i have uncovered a little

756
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,920
answer grid

757
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,000
over on the right hand side uh but the

758
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,040
only other thing i noticed was that room

759
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,400
three wants to put all the salt in

760
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,920
baguettes

761
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,960
which will definitely work but you need

762
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,200
a little bit of salt in in banana bread

763
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,400
um let me check my answer grid as to

764
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,640
which of which

765
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,079
uh three three and a half grams of salt

766
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,560
in banana bread and 10 grams of salt in

767
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,160
in in baguettes

768
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,440
so

769
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,720
the

770
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,880
those that did it fast

771
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,280
figured out what were the done items

772
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
really quickly there are only two done

773
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,839
items on our list

774
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,680
one is all ingredients are fresh

775
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,359
right that applies equally to baguettes

776
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,880
and banana bread and the other one is

777
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,880
kitchen was clean

778
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,680
at the time of preparation which is

779
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,000
probably an externally imposed

780
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,440
standard right that we need to have at

781
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,640
least i hope it is depending on where

782
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,560
you are in the world

783
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,720
right

784
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,000
and martin that i would say not only

785
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,280
that but if we had any other

786
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,440
backlog item to that even if it doesn't

787
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,560
use salt or whatever

788
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,760
also that is it's going to apply

789
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,880
so

790
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,160
yeah

791
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,400
i i think the kitchen at the clean of

792
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,160
kitchen clean at time of preparation i

793
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,200
would like that apply

794
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,680
to anybody making any products that i

795
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,280
put in my mouth

796
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,319
right regardless of whether they're a

797
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,119
bakery

798
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,400
or

799
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,240
anything else i'm not sure it does but i

800
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,359
would like it to

801
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,880
i think my wife would impose a

802
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,280
kitchen clean at end of preparation

803
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,160
as an additional condition

804
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,599
oh yes is that a condition of you being

805
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,599
allowed to cook again peter

806
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,200
i am actually

807
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,079
tidying up actually

808
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,560
yeah

809
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,200
i i i like to have everything clean and

810
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,599
finished what at the end of the

811
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,920
that as well

812
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,520
right so

813
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,800
determining at which things are which

814
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,880
um are really really important

815
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,760
um so i think

816
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,800
i think where are we i think we should

817
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,000
do the

818
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,680
um the what don't we know

819
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,520
exercise

820
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,319
so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna

821
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,400
recreate again so we don't end up with

822
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,319
the same people that way if you end up

823
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,920
with somebody you don't like you'll be

824
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,400
with somebody else next time there we go

825
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,400
so i re re-jigged

826
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,200
we jigged the rooms

827
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,200
uh let me

828
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,000
do that there we go

829
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,079
um

830
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,160
i have a little little uh fast pass to

831
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,200
see oh forget the little round one round

832
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,119
two stuff at the top that's uh

833
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,880
left over from anna and i building these

834
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,440
uh

835
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,119
exercises earlier

836
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,640
well yesterday day before yesterday i

837
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,560
can't remember when we did it

838
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,160
um but i'll look at those three three

839
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,359
statements

840
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,160
and see if you can't come up with a an

841
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,640
answer uh for each one so what's the

842
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,760
difference between acceptance criteria

843
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,119
and done

844
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,520
right so i'm hoping you'll be able to

845
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,680
answer that now can it be done without

846
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,200
meeting the acceptance criteria

847
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,800
is the second question that might be a

848
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,720
little bit more contentious

849
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,520
and then how does definition have done

850
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,079
serve transparency

851
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,480
okay so i'm going to click to open uh

852
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,800
the rooms and see if you can't add a

853
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,480
little post post-it to the board uh

854
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,880
answering each of those questions and

855
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,280
i'll probably ask three people

856
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,960
when we get back what they think

857
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,200
um

858
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,640
we don't have time to ask everybody but

859
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,839
we can

860
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,839
get a few people

861
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,319
okay yeah i kept you here this time

862
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,520
yeah okay

863
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,680
it was nice being in the breakout room

864
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,319
i i like enjoy interacting with folks as

865
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,960
well but it's it's funny well especially

866
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,720
in in one one two four all is always a

867
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,520
nightmare for breakout rooms

868
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,920
because

869
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,400
you've got two minutes to reorganize

870
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,400
everybody into the new room so that

871
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,480
when you hit gold

872
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,880
yeah and people coming back saying what

873
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,440
is happening and then sending them yeah

874
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,079
yeah yeah that part's not fun that's i

875
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,160
so i turn off their ability to come back

876
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,400
when i'm doing breakout rooms so i don't

877
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,240
allow them to do that um

878
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,920
and what's the other thing that helps

879
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,000
with that oh i'll put a timer on let's

880
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,960
put a timer on for for

881
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,960
six minutes there we go

882
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,520
um

883
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,200
we've got a good good good grip good mix

884
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
it's definitely a topic people are

885
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,440
interested in all lewis has disappeared

886
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,440
yeah he said he had to leave ah

887
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,520
that's that's cool he's just he's just

888
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,520
popping in louis i

889
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,040
louis is our uh

890
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,880
pst

891
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,880
okay as well

892
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,880
um

893
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,000
so he was coming in to see what's what's

894
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:38,599
going on what's going on here yeah

895
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,599
what are these idiots up to

896
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,520
yeah i was seeing in the breakout rooms

897
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,520
that uh

898
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,440
the the way that they are trying they

899
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,240
were trying to organize the

900
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,599
the

901
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,680
the difference between acceptance

902
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,400
creativity and the definition of dunk

903
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,240
they were trying to find the

904
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
the common aspects

905
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,640
but not the standards yeah i think

906
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,960
that's dysfunctional in the way i

907
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,960
explained it at the start i think i may

908
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,960
be

909
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,119
it's based on experience yes

910
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,520
so maybe they were

911
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,400
guessing their decisions

912
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,599
yeah

913
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,599
and i i do find that confusion between

914
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,720
acceptance criteria and done is so

915
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,880
common

916
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,359
so common um

917
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,359
so when they i i see they're starting to

918
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,920
answer

919
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,960
answer uh uh things

920
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,400
um

921
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,319
on

922
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,760
the concrete practices section i don't

923
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,680
know if you noticed i i added some

924
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,880
pictures of pies

925
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,930
yeah so we're adding some meat products

926
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,040
to our um

927
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,800
[Music]

928
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,640
so that that

929
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,160
meat products come with additional

930
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,559
definition of done

931
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,040
stuff like you might start thinking

932
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,559
about how what temperature the inside of

933
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,720
things get to

934
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,240
which can also equally apply to the

935
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,520
baked goods

936
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,200
but is more important for the meat goods

937
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,839
that's that's that's what i was getting

938
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,880
to with with that one

939
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,680
um

940
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,359
so that introduced that as a

941
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,920
would you like to introduce that as a

942
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:26,000
change in the

943
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,599
in the the the corporate our companies

944
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,480
you do it yourself because you know it

945
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,040
better okay and it's for me so i don't

946
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,200
want to i don't want to

947
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,480
make them understand something that it's

948
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,880
not so

949
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,839
um i don't think there's any danger of

950
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,440
that

951
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,720
i will

952
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,000
i will

953
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,280
do more next time okay that's

954
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,200
that's cool first thing through um

955
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,200
so then they're going to go into a one

956
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,720
two four all

957
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,240
um

958
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,240
to come up with additional things

959
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,640
uh i'm actually i've i've left

960
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,640
that should be covered

961
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,200
uh i just covered it i was that was my

962
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,920
answers grid

963
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,800
um so just they now we've introduced

964
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,119
meat

965
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,160
are they gonna think of the additional

966
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,359
things

967
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,119
um

968
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,800
that we put on there and then did you

969
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,800
see i brought in some

970
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,400
examples of definition of done and

971
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,599
they're software ones but

972
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,680
i just copied them out of the the aps

973
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,760
sd the software delivery one from

974
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,440
richard hunthousen's book

975
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,640
which is awesome

976
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,920
and they're just from from various

977
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,839
microsoft

978
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,960
test

979
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,960
products uh

980
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,680
so that should be good we're doing uh

981
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,160
pretty good on

982
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,920
right time yeah we're doing unusually

983
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,760
good on time which is good

984
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,280
because we have that the workshop to

985
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,920
explain as well

986
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,920
um so

987
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,359
i am actually gonna what i'm gonna do is

988
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,880
i'm gonna pull in a copy of your

989
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,599
workshop

990
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,680
okay which i didn't do that's my mistake

991
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,839
and then we can talk about it here but

992
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,839
then they've got the link for it in the

993
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,920
uh

994
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,160
i can't remember where i put it

995
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,000
oh no you you put it in the

996
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,839
yeah i got it

997
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,760

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,960
you can just go find

1000
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,160
uh that

1001
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,040
um

1002
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,920
definition of done tune up workshop from

1003
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,079
anna

1004
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,240
uh in

1005
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,240
let me get a copy of that there we go

1006
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,240
it's just a community portal so it's

1007
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,240
community.nkdiagility.com

1008
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,359
uh let me create a mural from the

1009
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,760
template she's given us a lovely

1010
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:51,359
template it's it's very pretty as well

1011
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,559
it's got the purple we like the purple

1012
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,839
that's ours

1013
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,839
i use your purple

1014
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,079
i am very predictable in

1015
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,960
um

1016
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,880
the color choice that i use

1017
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,240
let me

1018
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,240
make this a bit bigger and then paste it

1019
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,480
in there

1020
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,480
ah

1021
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:20,160
i i i did another copy of it that was

1022
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,160
actually a lot bigger

1023
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,680
more like

1024
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,480
probably

1025
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,280
that big something like that

1026
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,520
it's it's it's good for for zooming in

1027
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,680
if you have to if you have to zoom in to

1028
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,920
see cards and things

1029
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,319
uh i try and make it as as big as

1030
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,319
possible

1031
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:47,359
so i i did this workshop um

1032
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:49,040
last week with one with three teams

1033
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,839
and um

1034
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,920
and

1035
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:54,079
the part i like the most we will talk

1036
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,720
about it later but the one that we like

1037
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,880
the most was the imagine that

1038
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,640
how the definition of dawn could have

1039
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,920
helped you if you had it like um

1040
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,800
like in your daily work

1041
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,800
yeah

1042
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,920
that definitely i i quite liked i like

1043
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,920
that exercise as well

1044
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,160
okay so i believe that time is up i have

1045
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,079
clicked to close the breakout rooms

1046
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,240
okay there's a 10 second warning in

1047
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,880
teams remember so they

1048
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,880
they come back

1049
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,520
okay

1050
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,480
let's see

1051
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,319
i did see we had a couple of people drop

1052
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,760
out so some folks ended up in a room

1053
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,760
with two

1054
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,760
but at least it was a room of two and

1055
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,000
not a room of one i was trying to make

1056
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,510
sure that we don't have a room of one

1057
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,760
um

1058
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:44,240
[Music]

1059
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,000
so i saw lewis dropped off

1060
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,140
kate

1061
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,480
what um

1062
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,240
[Music]

1063
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,440
what was your

1064
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,960
outcome

1065
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,079
that you thought of between these three

1066
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,119
questions

1067
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,079
what were your insights

1068
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,880
um

1069
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,400
so i think um

1070
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,400
i think we were fairly clear on number

1071
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,520
one but i think number two was you know

1072
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,200
can it be

1073
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,119
acceptance criteria are more of a

1074
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,520
kind of a business requirement so

1075
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,520
actually as you move through development

1076
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,720
and you learn more things then actually

1077
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,839
those acceptance criteria could change

1078
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,960
so

1079
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,520
yep or

1080
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,680
certainly that's that's the case as i've

1081
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,160
seen so you know

1082
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,680
in some instances

1083
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,280
if you if they don't then i guess you

1084
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,359
wouldn't meet your definition of done

1085
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,520
but

1086
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,680
i guess maybe it depends if you have

1087
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,160
must meet acceptance criteria on your

1088
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,920
definition of done

1089
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,440
true i i i do tend to recommend against

1090
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,920
that but we'll we'll hear from a couple

1091
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,680
of other people first

1092
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,880
um let's see who was in uh uh to

1093
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,240
uh andre

1094
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,240
you were in room two weren't you

1095
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,720
you should be out

1096
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,839
the first one is uh quite sure

1097
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,670
a certain character is specific for

1098
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:26,399
backlog

1099
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:26,399
[Music]

1100
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,400
depends it depends so if the definition

1101
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,599
of that is referencing to the absorption

1102
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:45,200
criteria so a certain nuclear need to be

1103
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:48,960
as part of a finishing of that so if if

1104
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,960
it's considered done then

1105
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,559
it should be

1106
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:56,000
[Music]

1107
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,160
mid but if not so

1108
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,160
no

1109
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,079
so it's depend

1110
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
okay

1111
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,440
and the third one is uh

1112
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,480
yeah it's assist uh by not letting you

1113
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,880
hide the income incomplete

1114
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,720
i i like i like the way you phrased that

1115
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,160
not letting you hide in complete work i

1116
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,480
like the way you phrased that that's

1117
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,760
that's a that's a good way to

1118
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,400
um

1119
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,599
to do that uh i think let's hear from

1120
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,599
one more max

1121
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,680
yes sir

1122
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,480
what was what was your what did your

1123
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,480
group discuss

1124
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,400
uh i was trying to write it down um

1125
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,960
victoria had a little uh victoria and

1126
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,160
lisa had a better understanding of it um

1127
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,240
can be done

1128
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,680
without meeting the acceptance criteria

1129
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,280
so

1130
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,359
uh

1131
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,960
i i think i might have to rely on

1132
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,640
victoria because i think she explained

1133
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,119
it pretty well

1134
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,640
so what what happened to us yeah we were

1135
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,040
having a discussion

1136
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,280
of but what happens when the acceptance

1137
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,520
ratio is not clear i think victoria was

1138
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,760
telling telling us that she had like

1139
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,520
experiences with the

1140
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:12,880
developer uh thinking of something is uh

1141
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,880
ready to go accepted

1142
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,160
there were some

1143
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,559
misunderstandings or like maybe like the

1144
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,240
question would be how can we make this

1145
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,880
more clear or

1146
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:34,480
uh how do you do an acceptance criteria

1147
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,839
that it doesn't create misunderstandings

1148
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,960
that's correct

1149
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,960
yeah

1150
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,359
yeah and i think it's it's definitely an

1151
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,280
interesting conundrum

1152
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,559
because

1153
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,960
the acceptance criteria is part of your

1154
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:51,520
scope

1155
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,680
right that's that's a that's a scope

1156
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,720
problem

1157
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:59,119
do we do we as a team

1158
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,839
commit to scope

1159
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,839
in a sprint

1160
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,160
is that a good id

1161
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,680
is that a good idea we don't commit to

1162
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,040
scope peter

1163
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,480
we commit to a goal

1164
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,559
right which means we may have to do some

1165
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,720
things to get there

1166
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,760
but we don't commit to individual

1167
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,160
backlog items and we don't commit

1168
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,040
to things that need to happen for those

1169
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,040
backlog items

1170
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,839
so having acceptance criteria on our

1171
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,000
definition of done

1172
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,000
might lock us into

1173
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:40,559
a scope that we maybe can't achieve

1174
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,319
we're not focused on scope

1175
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:46,559
with done we're focused on quality

1176
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,319
we can deliver an awesome quality

1177
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,880
product that does not do what the

1178
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:54,160
customer asked for i agree

1179
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,599
right but at least we've met the quality

1180
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,200
bar

1181
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,440
if i deliver a baguette

1182
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,480
that does not have

1183
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:07,200
uh that is a let's say i deliver a

1184
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,760
baguette that's a circle

1185
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:12,079
instead of straight lines

1186
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,520
right using exactly the same

1187
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,839
ingredients

1188
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:18,880
but it it ends up being a hoop

1189
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,799
right it is

1190
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,079
still meets

1191
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,079
our definition of done

1192
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:31,319
kitchen clean it type of time of

1193
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,319
preparation

1194
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,960
and even if we had a taste test it's

1195
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,960
going to taste the same

1196
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,480
so it is the same

1197
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,040
thing

1198
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:47,200
it's not just it's just not in a format

1199
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,200
that our customers might find visually

1200
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,920
appealing or within the bounds of their

1201
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,160
expectation

1202
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,079
which still might be a problem

1203
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,319
but they're not going to get sick and

1204
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,319
die

1205
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,520
i mean that that's ultimately what our

1206
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,280
definition of done is to protect from

1207
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,040
sick and die is obviously an extreme

1208
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,200
version right whether you're building

1209
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,160
planes or pacemakers or

1210
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,240
food

1211
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,599
but even

1212
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,839
how does

1213
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:17,680
how does your your stakeholders how do

1214
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:21,040
your stakeholders

1215
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:24,000
know what they're looking at

1216
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,000
at a sprint review

1217
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,760
you need to have some kind of agreement

1218
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:32,240
working agreement on what does what does

1219
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,680
done what does the quality bar minimum

1220
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:36,559
quality bar that your customers will

1221
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,559
accept look like

1222
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,520
otherwise we could not do some of those

1223
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,680
quality aspects

1224
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,720
still deliver what the customer asked

1225
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,680
for

1226
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,240
and we've hidden

1227
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:53,839
potentially hidden some technical debt

1228
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,839
even if we didn't do it intentionally

1229
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,040
sorry sorry on your example like how's

1230
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,720
the acceptance criteria useful if you're

1231
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:04,559
not using it

1232
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,640
you you you are absolutely using it

1233
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,280
right but the the the

1234
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,960
the sprint backlog

1235
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,160
is a guide

1236
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,640
towards

1237
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,280
the sprint goal the sprint goal is the

1238
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,160
thing you're trying to achieve

1239
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,119
right

1240
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,480
um whether whether you do four of the

1241
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,160
acceptance criteria or three

1242
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,079
might not make any difference to your

1243
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,839
ability to meet the sprint goal and to

1244
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,160
deliver the customers something that

1245
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,920
adds value to their to their product to

1246
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,079
their lives to their

1247
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,960
efficiency whatever those things are

1248
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,680
that you're trying to achieve yeah

1249
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,680
yeah

1250
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,520
because we need that flexibility because

1251
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,839
we don't know how long things are going

1252
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,760
to take and things never take the same

1253
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:50,319
amount of time than you think they are

1254
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:53,200
so that variance

1255
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:55,839
is part of that that thing we have to

1256
01:01:53,200 --> 01:02:00,640
accept but we cannot accept lower

1257
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:00,640
quality because it's too easy to hide it

1258
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,480
right now i think those are the um

1259
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,599
quality standards are are so important

1260
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,880
there's a whole area in the uk currently

1261
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,720
i think jill i think you mentioned it

1262
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,720
before uh but they they're they're

1263
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,640
currently having to boil their water

1264
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,280
because there's e coli

1265
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:23,839
in the water supply

1266
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:28,160
right does that meet your standard and

1267
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:29,599
expectation as a customer absolutely not

1268
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,119
right you do not

1269
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,119
expect that to be true

1270
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,520
yeah i think you are right here uh

1271
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,440
martin uh i think i would like to say

1272
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,799
one thing uh so

1273
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,280
again your dod is again based on your

1274
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,880
team development team and the agreement

1275
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,680
between the development team and the

1276
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,319
product owner so

1277
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,039
in duty you can consider like if you are

1278
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,960
like kind of uh

1279
01:02:55,039 --> 01:03:00,559
i don't want to make it like a very

1280
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:01,599
extreme level of dod so you can say okay

1281
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,760
out of

1282
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,680
three three or three out of four maybe

1283
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,359
uh acceptance criteria could be

1284
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,440
considered for dod

1285
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:13,000
but if you want to make a decision

1286
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,400
then you can say no we have to consider

1287
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,160
foreign so this is something

1288
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,680
that might be a negotiation that we have

1289
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,520
with the product owner

1290
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,680
right no that might be just a thing that

1291
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,680
we we have a chat about because

1292
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:28,079
we don't think we can do them all let's

1293
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,400
go to the product owner is this okay if

1294
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,480
we don't have everything and we can

1295
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,400
do something else later

1296
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,799
that's that's scope is always negotiable

1297
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,880
in scrum so what is on your sprint back

1298
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:42,559
clock including the exceptions criteria

1299
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,400
is all negotiable

1300
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,839
so we don't commit to any of it so

1301
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,880
that's why having it on your definition

1302
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,200
of done

1303
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,280
might not be such a good idea although

1304
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,079
it's very common i do see a lot of teams

1305
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:56,480
put meets acceptance criteria or

1306
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:59,119
approved by the product owner on their

1307
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:03,760
definition of done and but those things

1308
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,760
will inhibit your ability to be flexible

1309
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,200
victoria i'm just going to

1310
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,319
mute mute you again just the background

1311
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,440
noise

1312
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,160
gin long

1313
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,599
you've got your hand up

1314
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,359
uh yeah the

1315
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,400
you mentioned the commandment for

1316
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,039
developers to achieve the is to achieve

1317
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,280
the

1318
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:26,720
spreading goal yeah they're

1319
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:29,359
i remember something like their uh

1320
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,920
commitment is also to achieve uh like

1321
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,760
increment increase i increment

1322
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,200
something like that yeah

1323
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,000
so so um the this the scrum guide it has

1324
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,880
some

1325
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,920
weird phrasing around that it basically

1326
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,240
says that your increment

1327
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,480
is born when your product meets the

1328
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,480
definition of done that's effectively

1329
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,079
you have an increment when it meets the

1330
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,440
definition of done if your product

1331
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,359
doesn't meet the definition of done

1332
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,119
you've not met the quality level for it

1333
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,799
to be releasable

1334
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,119
right regardless of how many features

1335
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:03,920
you managed to deliver in it the scope

1336
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,160
um but if you met the definition of done

1337
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:09,119
then it's in a releasable state if we're

1338
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,200
talking about software uh or even other

1339
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:14,559
things as well if i if i was if i was

1340
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,160
writing a a book uh with some colleagues

1341
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,160
you know

1342
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,599
julong you i peter and anna are all

1343
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,039
gonna write a we're gonna write a book

1344
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:22,480
we're gonna collaborate on this this

1345
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,240
book about agile

1346
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,680
right um we can we can

1347
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,119
we can write

1348
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,720
various levels of detail on our content

1349
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,599
for the different chapters that we work

1350
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,640
on

1351
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:40,640
but if it is poorly written

1352
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:43,200
bad uh language bad grammar

1353
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,920
purely poor spelling

1354
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,520
it's not really in a readable releasable

1355
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,520
state

1356
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:52,799
but i could write part of that book as a

1357
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:54,960
blog post or a post on linkedin

1358
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,400
to to to gain

1359
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,920
feedback

1360
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,559
from our potential readers and

1361
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:04,640
stakeholders on particular topics

1362
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,720
without having to write the whole thing

1363
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,119
so that that's that's the quality part

1364
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,039
is are you able to ship that thing to

1365
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,880
production if that is true well we've

1366
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,200
made our definition of done

1367
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,599
and i think that will be reflected uh um

1368
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,400
in anna's going to talk about the the

1369
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,680
workshop that she's built to provide for

1370
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,760
everybody

1371
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,359
and that's part of part of that story as

1372
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,119
well

1373
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:29,839
but thank you for that that's

1374
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,559
good yeah in fact uh i just have found

1375
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:35,119
this sentence from the scrum guide we

1376
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:38,640
were talking developers are the people

1377
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,760
in the scrum team that are committed to

1378
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:44,799
creating any aspect of a useful

1379
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,480
increment interspersed usable yeah

1380
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,839
that's the they has to be usable if it's

1381
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,160
not usable

1382
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:52,000
we've not mitigated any risk

1383
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,599
that's our definition of done helps us

1384
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,280
mitigate risk

1385
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,839
working product usable usable product

1386
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,440
and they do use that terminology because

1387
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:04,640
they don't want to talk about software

1388
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,640
anymore because there's so many more

1389
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,520
people and organizations in the world

1390
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,520
using scrum using it as a method for

1391
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,520
organizing their own work

1392
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,520
so they they definitely i think they've

1393
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,160
done a pretty good job of removing all

1394
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,640
of the the software focused but it does

1395
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,640
mean there's some weird words

1396
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,400
in the scrum guide that that you have to

1397
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,440
go like what the heck does that actually

1398
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,559
mean

1399
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:31,440
um and then it's within your context

1400
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,119
um i did did scrum training for police

1401
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,039
officers in ghana

1402
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,760
uh that were using

1403
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:39,039
scrum as a method for organizational

1404
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,720
change

1405
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,760
right so they weren't building software

1406
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,319
in fact

1407
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,160
90 of people in the room had

1408
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:47,440
not no idea what a computer looks like

1409
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,520
obviously everybody knows what a

1410
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,640
computer looks like but we didn't have

1411
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:55,119
good usage even usage of a of a computer

1412
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,119
with word or anything it's not something

1413
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,400
they do on a daily basis everything's

1414
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,240
paper-based

1415
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,720
so the the thing was how do we change

1416
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,799
this organization how do we iterate on

1417
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,119
making incremental improvements to the

1418
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:08,480
to the way the organization operates

1419
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,480
yeah so you can use in all sorts of

1420
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,480
places

1421
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,920
um

1422
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,440
i think we want to

1423
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,920
introduce a new market opportunity for

1424
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,880
our bakery

1425
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,759
um

1426
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,960
there is is is a huge opportunity to

1427
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:31,600
steal the market in meat snacks

1428
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,719
uh meat-based pastries

1429
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,279
um but i'm pretty sure once we start

1430
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,679
having meat in our products we're gonna

1431
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,159
have to have some additional things on

1432
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,319
our definition of done

1433
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:49,199
okay because uh serving serving um

1434
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,839
not under undercooked baguettes

1435
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,719
while our customers might not like it

1436
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,799
they're

1437
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,560
not likely to die

1438
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:59,120
but if we serve

1439
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,719
poorly cooked meat products

1440
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,040
that is certainly a lot riskier

1441
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,960
right so maybe we need to tighten up

1442
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,640
our our definition of done this is a new

1443
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,319
market opportunities we need to figure

1444
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,640
out what needs to be

1445
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:15,120
on our definition of done

1446
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,400
so we're going to do a little exercise

1447
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,799
um

1448
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,400
called a one two four all

1449
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:22,480
some of you may have participated in

1450
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,400
these in the past

1451
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:26,480
um but let me

1452
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,400
if i let me

1453
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,120
fill the breakout rooms first because

1454
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,040
there's a couple of people dropped off

1455
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,920
and then we will recreate the breakout

1456
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:39,120
rooms uh and i will do that in just a

1457
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,880
moment uh but what we're going to do

1458
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,000
ah

1459
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,960
goodness me quite a few people have

1460
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,880
dropped off

1461
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,040
see that's that top that every half

1462
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,799
hours and top of the hours is when

1463
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,600
everybody disappears

1464
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:50,480
um

1465
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,920
so

1466
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,840
we're gonna do

1467
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,400
one minute silently and on your own

1468
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,080
writing down a list of additional things

1469
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,679
that need to be on our definition of

1470
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,360
done now we're including meat products

1471
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,880
so what needs to be

1472
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,239
on your definition of done you can do it

1473
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,360
on the mural you can do it on a bit of

1474
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:13,120
paper uh you can do it in in one note or

1475
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,199
word or whatever you like

1476
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:17,840
um but silently and you're on your own

1477
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:20,000
i'm gonna put one minute on the timer

1478
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,440
and then i'll start breakout rooms in

1479
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,640
pairs

1480
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,080
uh

1481
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,719
so

1482
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,719
let's that will be ten i think

1483
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:35,840
oh it will be five because i can't count

1484
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:39,280
i can't count anna that's the problem

1485
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,880
does he want to mean anywhere just do

1486
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:44,480
this

1487
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:46,800
this calcula is part of the fun

1488
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,800
okay

1489
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,679
part of the fun of being dyslexic

1490
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:55,080
add in a bit of discalcula and you're

1491
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:55,080
off to the races

1492
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,320
it's even more fun peter when you add a

1493
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,640
bit of dyspraxia in there as well

1494
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,640
well i was thinking of actually

1495
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,520
is there you're not got then

1496
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,440
no

1497
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,600
so do you know what's funny there's like

1498
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,480
eight seconds left in in my parents

1499
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,880
house it's an older house so it has the

1500
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,280
door handles are high up remember in the

1501
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,480
old victorian houses the door handles

1502
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,520
were high up

1503
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:28,239
and all of them in the house are bent

1504
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:31,120
and the reason they're bent a little bit

1505
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:33,280
is because when i got old enough

1506
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,520
that like my shoulder wouldn't go

1507
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:38,000
underneath

1508
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,120
the door handle i started walking into

1509
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,120
them

1510
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,159
and i walked into them so much that

1511
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:47,600
everyone in the house is is bent

1512
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:49,040
part of the fun of growing up

1513
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,840
in scotland

1514
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,120
okay

1515
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,880
for everybody

1516
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,640
in the uk the rest of us in the uk are

1517
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,840
fairly normal it's just the scots just

1518
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,520
the scots

1519
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:00,000
that's it's because that we've got all

1520
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:02,320
the the the genius genes

1521
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,560
um we invented pretty much everything

1522
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,840
peter that's that's why uh

1523
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,600
we've got all of these additional

1524
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,840
things steam engine can we get the steam

1525
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,840
engine

1526
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,199
we can we can start we can kind of just

1527
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:20,080
fight another occasion so two minutes in

1528
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:21,840
pairs to merge your lists together get

1529
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,560
them on the mural and add some more

1530
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,560
items okay

1531
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,840
oh well i did do

1532
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,840
three okay okay

1533
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,120
so let me do two minutes oh two

1534
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:40,400
and then we have five rooms and that's a

1535
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:42,400
pain in the butt to merge into

1536
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,480
two pairs so we're gonna have a room of

1537
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,600
more

1538
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,040
um

1539
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:53,679
so let me do the assign participants

1540
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:56,560
uh so that'll be five five goes into one

1541
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,800
five into one

1542
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,800
four

1543
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,600
where's um at

1544
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,679
four goes into two

1545
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,239
four goes into two

1546
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,800
ah hold on yes cancel

1547
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:12,800
somebody's

1548
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,360
no it's everybody's there

1549
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,840
where's amit

1550
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,800
oh maybe already gone okay

1551
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:27,199
do it again five into one five

1552
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,040
into one

1553
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:32,880
four

1554
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,880
goes into two four

1555
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,040
and then

1556
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,040
three

1557
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,800
just goes into two again

1558
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,320
three into two

1559
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,120
there we go so

1560
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,960
i've got that set up i can leave it

1561
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,120
uh they've got about 40 seconds left so

1562
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,159
they're starting to create some items

1563
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,080
um

1564
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,000
there's test control coming in i think

1565
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,760
there's a weird posted there haste

1566
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,239
testing control

1567
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,320
that's a good idea

1568
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,159
uh utensil

1569
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,000
cleaned and disinfected

1570
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,000
i would say that's included in kitchen

1571
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,400
clean at time of preparation

1572
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,560
um somebody introducing some meat health

1573
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,719
standards find out what they are include

1574
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,560
them in our definition of done uh

1575
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,640
properly cooked meat products properly

1576
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,600
cooked i think we can just say all

1577
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,960
products

1578
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,120
properly cooked i don't think it has to

1579
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,920
be meat products but we'll we'll get to

1580
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,239
that

1581
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,400
refrigeration if refrigeration might

1582
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,440
become a more important thing how do we

1583
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,159
store

1584
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,000
our um

1585
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,760
meat before we cook it

1586
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,040
storing our meat

1587
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,760
oh there we go

1588
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,120
let me click the assign button move

1589
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,120
there we go

1590
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,440
and they'll get four

1591
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,520
minutes in four pairs but it's not quite

1592
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,480
four pairs because it's

1593
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,480
funny-ass groups

1594
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,800
we lost quite a lot of people at the

1595
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,800
1730

1596
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,120
well 17 30 for me

1597
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,120
that's

1598
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,199
1630

1599
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,960
utc

1600
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:12,880
so it depends which time zone you're in

1601
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,719
but that might be

1602
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,600
what i have done for the day or it could

1603
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,840
be

1604
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:22,080
it's too late i i know that um andre's

1605
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,520
it's pretty late for andre

1606
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:27,120
um for him it is

1607
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,159
quite late i think we go to midnight for

1608
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,120
andre

1609
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,880
uh so he's just before midnight

1610
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:36,000
we're getting a good group of uh people

1611
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,679
in uh very different aspects i know

1612
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,679
some folks are

1613
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,679
have an engineering background software

1614
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:44,000
background some folks have

1615
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,239
no engineering or ite background

1616
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,840
whatsoever and that's that's a good mix

1617
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:52,239
uh coming into the the the session

1618
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:55,199
um that's why i i kind of picked that

1619
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:56,800
story of the the

1620
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,040
um bakery

1621
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,360
because it's it's a good non

1622
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,440
non-technical aspect but as you see some

1623
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,800
of the conversations have been trending

1624
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,600
towards

1625
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,640
phrases like technical debt which are

1626
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:14,320
um very very

1627
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,440
i guess geeky i guess yeah a little bit

1628
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,320
so

1629
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,080
we want to have um as few

1630
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,600
purely technical conversations but

1631
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,440
things kind of gravitate toward there's

1632
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,040
a lot of software engineers

1633
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,360
there but hopefully we have enough to

1634
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,280
keep everybody else happy who's not a

1635
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:33,280
software engineer

1636
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:35,920
i'm definitely an enabler of those

1637
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,480
conversations trending to finding to

1638
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,040
technical uh uh gunther gunther

1639
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,520
vermeulen when i was doing my t-prep for

1640
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:46,719
the product owner class did kind of give

1641
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,920
me into a little bit of trouble for

1642
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,640
you know being a little bit too

1643
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,760
technical uh but the space that i tend

1644
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,000
to work in

1645
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,360
tends to be a technical space i tend to

1646
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,400
work with a lot of technical product

1647
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,760
owners

1648
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,080
um

1649
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,360
so product owners building products for

1650
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,440
developers

1651
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,400
product owners building engineering

1652
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,960
products

1653
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:11,120
um i've worked with a few systems where

1654
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,040
they're they're building always a flow

1655
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,080
as a flowmaster

1656
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,480
building

1657
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,400
software that manages the flow of

1658
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,600
liquids through oil rigs

1659
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,679
or

1660
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,719
kongsberg maritime building maritime

1661
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:29,120
simulation software all very very

1662
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:31,280
technical detailed um product domains

1663
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:33,600
right they're not really building the

1664
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,679
same level of commercial products that

1665
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,800
you would get on your on your phone or

1666
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,159
um

1667
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,840
just going to

1668
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:43,440
go to a website and buy but um it is it

1669
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,040
is important

1670
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,400
as a product owner to have an

1671
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,159
understanding of the technical domain

1672
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,480
within which you're working but you do

1673
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,760
not need to be technical as a product

1674
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,840
owner

1675
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,560
as a scrum master you want to have an

1676
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,560
understanding of the technical domain

1677
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,040
within which your teams are operating

1678
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,560
right um if you've got a bunch of teams

1679
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,480
that are building software you probably

1680
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,400
want to know what good software looks

1681
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,239
like you want to know what continuous

1682
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,480
delivery is and what it looks like what

1683
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:15,840
are unit tests and what do they look

1684
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,679
like right so you can help the team

1685
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,600
but maybe you bring somebody in to do

1686
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,560
that maybe

1687
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,800
you don't have to have those

1688
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,360
conversations i just think it helps

1689
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,120
um if we're working in a software

1690
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,120
company

1691
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,199
regardless of the job we're doing we

1692
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:33,199
probably want an understanding of what

1693
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:34,480
software is what it looks like how it's

1694
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,800
created

1695
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:39,280
if i was working in a bakery

1696
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,600
i would want to understand

1697
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,440
something about how to bake even if i'm

1698
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,239
just selling pies

1699
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,120
right

1700
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:49,199
somebody's gonna ask what's in the pie

1701
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,600
somebody's going to ask

1702
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,360
how do i cook it uh somebody's going to

1703
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,280
ask those questions and i should be able

1704
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,640
to answer them

1705
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,239
or i feel like i should be able to

1706
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,400
answer them i

1707
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,760
tend to like to know

1708
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,360
um

1709
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,040
about the products that i'm working with

1710
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,120
the products that i'm selling how

1711
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,400
they're created how they work

1712
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:12,159
um but that's maybe just me being a geek

1713
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:16,159
right and

1714
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:18,719
i like to to to to check up on mural see

1715
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,120
how things are working talk to their uh

1716
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:24,239
product owners uh give them improvements

1717
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,080
i work with use mighty networks so i'm

1718
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,760
diving into their documentation and

1719
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,920
figuring out how it works how is it

1720
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,520
going to support my business there we go

1721
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,600
everybody's back

1722
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,800
hello i was talking to myself a little

1723
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,920
bit there anna

1724
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,719
okay i tend to i do that quite a lot i

1725
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,719
do that quite a lot

1726
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,440
so

1727
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:49,120
i see some very interesting things

1728
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,520
on our our lists sorry sorry victoria

1729
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:54,080
again there's just some background noise

1730
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,600
or it's anu it's either agu

1731
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,520
um i don't know if it's victoria first

1732
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,520
name or or angular sometimes that's

1733
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,679
depends where the comma is

1734
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:06,400
uh so we've got a few things

1735
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,360
clean cleanliness obviously an important

1736
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,840
topic

1737
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:11,840
um but then there's additional things i

1738
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,120
i some things that i had not even

1739
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:18,159
thought of in my wildest dreams

1740
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:21,440
cross-contamination in the kitchen

1741
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:23,360
is a good one i do have a relative who

1742
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,440
is a celiac

1743
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,960
right although that's not a meat thing

1744
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,480
but you know

1745
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,000
somebody's a vegan they're gonna get

1746
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,800
upset if there's meat products in the

1747
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,440
same area uh if they're a celiac they're

1748
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,760
going to be incredibly ill

1749
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:41,360
she just came back from a vacation and

1750
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,960
she was so ill because other people if

1751
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,600
you're not a celiac you don't think

1752
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,239
about the level of contamination that is

1753
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,360
required to cause a problem it can be

1754
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,760
tiny

1755
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,480
so we've got meat products properly kit

1756
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:57,520
cooked i'd put that with meat health

1757
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,520
standards followed

1758
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:01,520
cross-contamination with utensils and

1759
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,320
disinfectate

1760
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,560
right i like that um

1761
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:09,280
maybe different shelf life's applied i i

1762
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:12,159
think the shelf life on bread

1763
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:14,000
is shorter than cakes

1764
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:16,480
um and meat products probably sit

1765
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,600
somewhere in the middle i'm not sure

1766
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,320
but now we've got to talk about

1767
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,320
refrigeration

1768
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,880
right maybe our maybe our baked products

1769
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:27,280
we kept them warm

1770
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,280
rather than letting them go cold

1771
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,520
but now our meat products we need

1772
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,600
refrigeration for the ingredients we

1773
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,520
need refrigeration for

1774
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:39,679
uh um the the the made products that's a

1775
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,800
little bit more complicated

1776
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:44,400
um some taste testing

1777
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:49,120
that sounds like a good idea does taste

1778
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:50,239
testing apply also to our baked goods

1779
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,400
yeah

1780
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:54,719
it does

1781
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,719
i had i had a couple of things

1782
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,320
on my here's some stuff i prepared

1783
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,679
earlier in case we don't get everything

1784
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,440
so i had a visual inspection

1785
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,199
that would solve my

1786
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,320
circular

1787
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:10,320
baguette problem wouldn't it

1788
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,480
i mentioned circular baguettes that's

1789
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,320
not really what we think of as baguettes

1790
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,639
uh one product in each batch has been

1791
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:18,080
test tested

1792
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:19,280
uh ensuring

1793
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,800
uh

1794
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,440
uh

1795
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:27,040
the there's an eu

1796
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,280
standard that is their title is farm to

1797
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,920
fork

1798
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:34,560
right ensuring safety standards all the

1799
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,679
way to to eating the product

1800
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,679
um

1801
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,120
and checking the that meat products are

1802
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,400
cooked to the right temperature so i

1803
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,920
think we covered

1804
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,080
most of that

1805
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,920
in the things we came up with

1806
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:48,639
right we need to add more things to our

1807
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,800
definition of that

1808
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:53,600
yeah martin while we're having a

1809
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,199
discussion because the definition of

1810
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,440
gums should apply

1811
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:58,719
to all but if we

1812
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,199
say

1813
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,360
meat product properly cooked it does not

1814
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,440
apply to the baguettes because they

1815
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,280
don't have meat

1816
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,400
yes

1817
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:13,280
i had the same concern for this one we

1818
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,679
only focus on bread and the bracket and

1819
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,120
maybe for next run when we talk about

1820
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:22,000
meat we can add this one to the updated

1821
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,679
definition down not for this round

1822
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,080
i agree with uh

1823
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,800
well maybe if we take

1824
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:30,000
if if i take this example here i'll make

1825
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,199
it bigger so we know which one we're

1826
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,400
talking about there we go the meat

1827
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:37,760
products properly cooked right if i just

1828
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:40,159
take the word meat off there

1829
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,800
products properly cooked

1830
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:45,120
right regardless of what that means to

1831
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,360
the individual products we want all our

1832
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:49,440
products to be properly cooked

1833
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:51,600
have you ever had a baguette that wasn't

1834
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,239
properly cooked and it's still

1835
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:57,120
yeah exactly exactly it still it applies

1836
01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:00,000
to both those products

1837
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:02,320
um and then instead of meat health

1838
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,120
standards followed we can just again

1839
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:08,320
take the word meat off

1840
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:10,320
right health standards followed

1841
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,520
each product different product different

1842
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,280
ingredients are going to have different

1843
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,639
health standards and we need to meet

1844
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,080
meet them all

1845
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,840
or at least i hope we're meeting them

1846
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,040
all for our bakery

1847
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,719
um

1848
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,199
so we we can

1849
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:26,880
we do want to think about that as part

1850
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:29,040
of our definition of done but i do agree

1851
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,960
that it is

1852
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,639
there may be things that are on your

1853
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,840
definition of done

1854
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:38,480
that don't apply equally to all products

1855
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,679
peter brought up a good example right at

1856
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,800
the beginning

1857
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,719
he said documentation

1858
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,560
right the amount of documentation you

1859
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:49,120
need for the

1860
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,840
the pacemaker firmware

1861
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:55,040
versus the printer

1862
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,880
right they're going to be different

1863
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:00,000
right the level of documentation you

1864
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,840
need who needs the documentation

1865
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,239
i'm sure printers have to meet iso

1866
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,639
standards too peter but they're probably

1867
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:10,400
not as strict and they're probably not

1868
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:12,000
as detailed as the pacemaker standards

1869
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,440
that's just just the way it is if you're

1870
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,120
building a plane

1871
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:17,120
i hope you've got good documentation

1872
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,600
so that does that make sense from how

1873
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:23,440
you would think about

1874
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,639
your definition of done

1875
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,360
cool

1876
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:30,560
so i just had a a few things uh here i

1877
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:33,920
had i had some example at definitions of

1878
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:36,159
done they're actually pulled from the um

1879
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,440
ap aps

1880
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:39,760

1881
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,280

1882
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,719
scrum for software delivery i'm just

1883
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,719
getting that actually i should have put

1884
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,960
the logo on there shouldn't i anna

1885
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:49,840
i don't even have it there never mind

1886
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,239
i'm going to try and get it quickly uh

1887
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,480
but oh there we go

1888
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,880
copy image paste

1889
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,560
yeah so i just stole that from the from

1890
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,600
the eps courseware

1891
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,239
um

1892
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,840
and really it's just

1893
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:06,159
an expression that there can be

1894
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,800
different levels of definition of done

1895
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:11,040
even for similar products uh each of

1896
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,400
these products listed here are fake

1897
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,520
products right they're just fake

1898
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,960
products but they have uh um

1899
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,000
different levels of definition of done

1900
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,000
but they're all websites

1901
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,480
right

1902
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,320
so it depends what your business is

1903
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,280
willing to pay for it depends on the

1904
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:28,159
risk

1905
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,560
of how and where you're delivering

1906
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:33,600
your product

1907
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:36,639
right there is an expression that i i

1908
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,080
use that i guess some people like and

1909
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,880
some people don't

1910
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,719
but i always say it's about risk

1911
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:46,880
low quality adds risk to your product

1912
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,120
and there is a risk

1913
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,600
to the organization if you deliver a

1914
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:54,719
crap product to production what's the

1915
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,719
risk to your brand

1916
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,639
right will your customers

1917
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,639
still come back if you deliver crappy

1918
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,560
product okay that's one

1919
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,560
what about the risk internally to your

1920
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,239
business

1921
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,120
right what's the financial risk not

1922
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:12,719
brand risk like what you look like

1923
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:14,080
but also the risk of

1924
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,440
your customers

1925
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,280
in your product

1926
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,679
think of think of boeing and the

1927
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:22,159
definition of done they should have had

1928
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,040
for the 737 max

1929
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,040
right

1930
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:27,520
they should have been thinking about the

1931
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,120
the risk to their brand

1932
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,800
massive risk

1933
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,679
nobody thinks of boeing well at the

1934
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,760
moment

1935
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,920
the risk to the customers a bunch of

1936
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,360
people died

1937
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:42,960
right but also what's the risk

1938
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,960
to the people working on the product

1939
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,520
how many of the people working on the

1940
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,840
that worked on that product

1941
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,679
are going to see prison time

1942
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,040
right there's an extreme example but

1943
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,800
prison time

1944
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,639
because they delivered a poor quality

1945
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,120
product and maybe didn't do the level of

1946
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:03,760
due diligence that people expect them to

1947
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,760
do that the industry expects them to do

1948
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,159
right so are your a your your developers

1949
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,199
the people working on your product at

1950
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:15,120
risk

1951
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:16,400
is your users at risk is your company

1952
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,159
at risk

1953
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,120
how do we mitigate those things those

1954
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,920
are things that need to go in your

1955
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,920
definition of done

1956
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,600
right hence why you want an

1957
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,600
organizational standard

1958
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:33,600
because it's not just the engineer's job

1959
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,600
to think about those things

1960
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,880
the people doing the work

1961
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,760
right but we don't always start

1962
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,520
with a good definition of done uh this

1963
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,199
is a poster

1964
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,719
here if you hover over it there's a

1965
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,000
little open button in the bottom right

1966
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:51,679
you don't have to click it but it'll

1967
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:54,159
open up big pdf uh poster for yes we

1968
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:55,679
have a definition of done and

1969
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:57,760
it's awesome

1970
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,719
right if you don't have a definition of

1971
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,760
done

1972
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:06,239
create a definition of done that you can

1973
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:09,280
achieve which might not equal releasable

1974
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:13,120
but you have to start somewhere

1975
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:14,719
and i think that's the point where um

1976
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,199
anna would you like to

1977
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,480
there is a few minutes left

1978
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:21,520
um

1979
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:25,360
if we all follow anna

1980
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,719
she can take us over to the workshop

1981
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,120
i'm just going to follow anna there we

1982
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,000
go if you you should have the ability to

1983
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,159
summon

1984
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:36,199
anna i think i made you a

1985
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:36,199
facilitator i did indeed

1986
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,520
i cannot

1987
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,000
bring everybody to me

1988
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:47,440
i will summon them there we go i

1989
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,800
summoned everybody okay thank you

1990
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,080
okay

1991
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,560
so

1992
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,360
well based on what we've been talking

1993
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,199
about uh it may be that in your teams

1994
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,080
you have a definition of dog or you

1995
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:00,880
don't

1996
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:04,080
uh and usually teams have a definition

1997
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,400
of done but they don't follow it or they

1998
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,520
have it somewhere in

1999
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,080
in

2000
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:11,040
hidden and and they don't use it uh

2001
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:14,000
daily

2002
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,440
so this workshop is uh to embrace the

2003
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,199
definition i've done

2004
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:20,000
and

2005
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:22,719
if you click this is a link uh if you

2006
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,440
click on it you will get into into the

2007
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:28,560
into the community and you will see the

2008
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:32,000
post on how to do this uh workshop

2009
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:35,040
but uh well uh basically uh with one to

2010
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,920
parole uh you will be able to to see

2011
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:40,320
what you're what you're doing but what

2012
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,920
what definition i've done you're

2013
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,159
having right now even though you don't

2014
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,560
have it written down or you're not using

2015
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:48,719
it that the developers and all the spam

2016
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:51,199
team has it in in their mind

2017
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:54,320
and also you will be able to see what

2018
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:56,960
things uh they would like to add and

2019
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,960
yeah that that takes us to the to the

2020
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,960
next uh so

2021
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,719
just to point out that the this

2022
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,239
particular

2023
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,760
workshop the columns here do represent

2024
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:09,840
a little bit more they're a little bit

2025
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:12,320
more geeky a little bit more software

2026
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,920
orientated uh so you've got

2027
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,960
what do you need to do before those

2028
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,560
codes

2029
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:21,520
to be coded tested integrated release

2030
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:23,600
releasable and then released what are

2031
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,280
the things that need to be true

2032
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,679
in all of those categories so that you

2033
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:29,920
can build up a big picture of everything

2034
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:33,199
that needs to be true to ship your

2035
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:35,840
software um if you're not doing software

2036
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:38,320
right and you're maybe doing marketing

2037
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,000
content or videos or whatever it is

2038
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,480
you're doing you you can change those

2039
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,320
headings to whatever the the stages you

2040
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,239
can think of that that work within your

2041
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:49,040
product

2042
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:51,280
yeah this way um it's basically to

2043
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,080
create like a storyline for them to

2044
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:54,080
think

2045
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,960
on what they've been doing

2046
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,520
uh

2047
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,840
so that they can identify quite good and

2048
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:02,560
wider stages they are applying those

2049
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:04,560
standards so it really helps to guide

2050
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,040
and don't just include your team the

2051
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:10,560
scrum team in this conversation

2052
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,159
include anybody who has a say

2053
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,560
in whether your product ships to

2054
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:16,000
production so that could be somebody in

2055
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,120
the security team somebody in the

2056
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,400
operations team somebody in the

2057
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,800
messaging

2058
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:25,199
team is our product on message

2059
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:27,199
right whatever whatever whoever can

2060
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:29,040
block your ability to deploy to

2061
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:30,800
production have them involved in this

2062
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,560
conversation

2063
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,639
and also and

2064
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:37,040
something that comes out of from doing

2065
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:41,360
this workshop may also be that somebody

2066
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:42,719
that it's not in your team should be

2067
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:45,679
yeah okay so

2068
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,880
this is uh like an eye opener when when

2069
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,400
you do it

2070
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:51,040
so uh

2071
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,460
once you have uh once you have that once

2072
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,880
you have

2073
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,199
[Music]

2074
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,400
all those post-its over there

2075
01:32:55,199 --> 01:33:00,080
uh then uh the all the everybody

2076
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,719
involved will start dragging into what

2077
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:04,639
they are really doing and the wish list

2078
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,480
and there is going to be a good

2079
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:09,280
conversation there because some people

2080
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:12,960
think that they are doing it some people

2081
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:15,520
uh do not and usually the people who is

2082
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,199
more um

2083
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,480
has more experience

2084
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:21,360
um

2085
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:24,800
it's more critical on on

2086
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:27,760
on our heavy on on what is being done

2087
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,360
and they they have a clear view on

2088
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,320
on this so

2089
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:35,360
uh this is also an eye opener

2090
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:37,920
and after doing this uh you can run a

2091
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,239
boat here to update the definition of

2092
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,040
time so you will see what you're doing

2093
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:45,440
embrace it and then

2094
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,520
if you see that it's possible add

2095
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:49,120
something else because sometimes you

2096
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,960
need to check if

2097
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:53,199
if you need to continue working with

2098
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:56,639
that definition i've done

2099
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:59,120
to make you more mature or you can add

2100
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:02,000
more things that's um

2101
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:04,560
there is a an additional psychological

2102
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,440
trick i i would definitely recommend

2103
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,760
here

2104
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:10,400
and that's that instead of having a this

2105
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:13,199
is a boolean proposition right so you've

2106
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:16,000
got doing or wishlist

2107
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:18,719
sometimes people will put it in doing

2108
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,760
when they're only kinda doing it

2109
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:25,199
right and maybe nobody argues

2110
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,880
but if you make it a three-state problem

2111
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,719
we're doing it

2112
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,800
we've kind of heard of it and are kind

2113
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:35,840
of doing it and then not doing it and we

2114
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:38,080
know as the person facilitating it that

2115
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:40,719
unless it's in the doing it category it

2116
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:43,360
counts as no we're not doing it

2117
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:45,600
right but it psychologically makes them

2118
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:48,080
feel better for being able to put things

2119
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,119
in that middle category we're kind of

2120
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,119
doing it

2121
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:53,280
you get more truth

2122
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:54,639
i've seen a lot of sticky notes in the

2123
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,080
middle of yeah

2124
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:58,159
yeah yeah people want to hedge their

2125
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,040
bets yeah

2126
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,280
yeah

2127
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,960
so uh

2128
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,480
once you have done that you have an

2129
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,480
agreement with the team

2130
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,600
you have what you're doing and what

2131
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:11,440
you're going to do and here this is my

2132
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,199
favorite part because the other part is

2133
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,679
like yeah building the definition of

2134
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:18,159
dawn but my favorite part comes here

2135
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:20,400
when it comes to imagine that and then

2136
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:23,119
you link to the past imagine that we

2137
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:26,080
have had this definition of done

2138
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:28,800
in the past what could happen what could

2139
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,840
how we could have done things better in

2140
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,920
terms of

2141
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,040
quality communication estimation

2142
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:38,560
expectations and there is where the

2143
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:42,000
the team really understands um

2144
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:44,080
how it can change their daily work

2145
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,639
and if you link it with the scrum events

2146
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:49,280
uh you give them the the option to to

2147
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,480
make them a stand in in in a real

2148
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,159
scenario

2149
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,639
where they could be using that

2150
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:56,400
definition of done daily

2151
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,480
and

2152
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:01,520
just um

2153
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:04,320
something else don't yeah make a follow

2154
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:07,280
up even though you can use this workshop

2155
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,600
once make a follow up um

2156
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:11,040
and the first planning after doing this

2157
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,920
workshop

2158
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,040
to grab this definition of done into the

2159
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,400
planning

2160
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,159
and

2161
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,320
put it on the table

2162
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,560
to because they are going to understand

2163
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,679
really what what it means in in in

2164
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,920
planning

2165
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,840
in in in adding things to the screen but

2166
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,320
also building the plan to build those

2167
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,920
things yeah when you first get a

2168
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:34,560
definition of done

2169
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:36,719
and don't expect everybody to magically

2170
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:39,040
remember it and follow it

2171
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:41,040
you you need to keep

2172
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,360
hammering back to that when you're doing

2173
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,280
refinement

2174
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,880
does does all of these things are we

2175
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,719
thinking about the definition of done

2176
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,280
have you thought about testing did you

2177
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:52,960
look at this what about security do we

2178
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,679
need to do something with security in

2179
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,920
this

2180
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,400
keep pointing at those things until it

2181
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,960
becomes second nature for the team

2182
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,159
to know and they own their definition of

2183
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,840
done

2184
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:06,560
and that i think is one of the key

2185
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,119
purposes of this exercise

2186
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,040
is because they put the items on it and

2187
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:13,520
they create it

2188
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:15,760
and they specify what they can do now

2189
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,080
versus what's on their wish list

2190
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,000
you can then keep revisiting it either

2191
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,080
at retrospectives

2192
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,880
um and maybe you don't do the whole

2193
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:27,119
exercise every retrospective

2194
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,119
you might just take here here was our

2195
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,639
wish list is there anything we want to

2196
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:32,560
try and

2197
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:34,239
put on our doing list get on to our

2198
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:36,080
definition of done these are things that

2199
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:37,760
we can't do yet okay

2200
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,719
what can we do around that what can we

2201
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,400
change

2202
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,560
um and then

2203
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,639
if you're just getting started and you

2204
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,239
don't have a definition of done or a

2205
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,320
brand new product

2206
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:52,000
and you could pull this workshop out at

2207
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,679
your sprint planning as well and just uh

2208
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,800
figure out what your definition of done

2209
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,800
is before you get started

2210
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:04,239
one thing that i i found out in this

2211
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:07,199
this workshop i got a question uh

2212
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:09,440
from a team member uh asking me okay but

2213
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:10,239
where where do we where do we check that

2214
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,280
this

2215
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:16,159
applies like if if we needed to have a

2216
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:17,520
moment like say okay check check check

2217
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:20,639
and

2218
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,360
it is not for that it is it is really in

2219
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,440
a team agreement uh

2220
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,199
it's something to embrace not because

2221
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,840
it's written in confluence or whatever

2222
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:31,119
we have to go through the

2223
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,920
checklist it's something more it's a

2224
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:36,400
team agreement and we need to respect

2225
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,159
all of us that agreement and then

2226
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:39,679
they started to understand what the

2227
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,719
definition of them

2228
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,040
uh

2229
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,040
meant

2230
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,719

did as featured so it should be right at

2245
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:27,560
the front of the community site as well

2246
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,600
and give us feedback

have run together i think there will

2251
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,199
probably be more because we had lots of

2252
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,560
fun

2253
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:44,719
at running it

2254
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,520
so we're always interested in in

2255
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:51,520
feedback and other topics

2256
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:53,119

2263
