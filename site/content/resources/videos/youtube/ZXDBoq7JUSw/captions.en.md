Three reasons why you should level up your knowledge and skills. I only need one: becoming a professional and continuing to be a professional. That's how you're able to keep being successful in your role, successful in your industry. It is continuous learning, continuous understanding, continuous trying and failing and trying again. That's what makes you the difference between a professional and an amateur, right? You actually care about what it is that you do and how you do it.
