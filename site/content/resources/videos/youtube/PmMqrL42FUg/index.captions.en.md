One of the seven deadly sins of Agile is sloth, and this manifests in a number of different ways with teams, with organisations, and with leadership all over the place. One of the most common elements is just not bothering our ARS, actually doing the things that we say we're going to do. Right? We say we're doing Agile, but we don't deliver working product at the end of the Sprint. We say we're doing Agile, but we have long, convoluted deployment processes which are not in control of the developers. We say we're doing Agile, but we don't have an ordered backlog. Right? All of these things are places where we say we're doing something, but really we're just kind of lazy and lying through our teeth in order to not have to do the work. 

Perhaps it's because somebody in leadership in the organisation has decided that thou shalt do Agile, and your product is not particularly suited to that model because it was built in a traditional way. Maybe it's got mainframe and all kinds of crazy stuff in there. Maybe there are other reasons why it's not viable within the confines, the structure of your organisation, the system that you're in. But I would much rather teams and people were honest and transparent with their companies and their organisations about what they can and cannot do, what is and is not Agile.
