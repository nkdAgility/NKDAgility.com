1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,360
one of the seven deadly sins of agile

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,000
it's sloth and this manifests in a

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,480
number of number of different ways with

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
with teams with

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,960
organizations uh with leadership all

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,119
over the place um one of the most common

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,400
um elements is just not bothering our

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
bothering our ARS actually doing the

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,759
things

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,480
um that that that we say we're going to

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,440
do right we say we're doing agile but we

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,600
don't deliver working product at the end

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,719
of the Sprint we say we're doing agile

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,520
um but we have long convoluted

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,840
deployment processes which are not in

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,480
control of the developers we say we're

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,960
doing agile um but we don't have an

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,640
ordered backlog right all of these

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,320
things

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,760
are places where we say we're doing

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,760
something but really we're just kind of

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,520
lazy and ly through our teeth in order

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,680
to not have to do the work perhaps it's

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,280
because somebody in leadership in the

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,439
organization has decided that thou shalt

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,840
do Agile and your product is not

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,159
particularly suited to that model

28
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,799
because it was built in a in a

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
traditional maybe it's got Mainframe and

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,360
all kinds of crazy stuff in there maybe

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,240
there are other reasons why it's not

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,400
viable within the the the confines the

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,040
structure of of of your organization the

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,040
system that you're in um but I would

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,880
much rather teams and people were honest

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,040
and

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
transparent with their companies and

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,399
their organizations about what they they

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,520
can and cannot do what isn't is not

40
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
agile and
