    "reasoning": "The content centers entirely on agile leadership training and innovations in course format, with no explicit reference or discussion of Service Level Expectation (SLE). There are no direct mentions of SLE, its calculation, purpose, or any core concepts associated with it (such as cycle time ranges or percentiles). The closest alignment is the general context of Agile, Scrum teams, and emphasis on improvement, but these are high-level thematic overlaps that do not address the specialized scope of SLE. The content thoroughly discusses training experience and leader development journeys, not workflow predictability or flow metrics. The audience (agile leaders and practitioners) overlaps in general, but the actual focus and intent are not about SLE or its application. Thus, all dimension scores remain at the low end, especially Direct Mentions, Conceptual Alignment, Depth of Discussion, and Intent. No penalties apply as there is no outdated information or undermining tone. The final confidence score is very low, reflecting a near-complete absence of qualifying SLE-related material.",
