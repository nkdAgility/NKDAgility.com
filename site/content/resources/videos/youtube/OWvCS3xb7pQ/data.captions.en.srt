1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,420
that is a very good question

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,019
uh so let's start from the very

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,839
beginning uh pal e so professional agile

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,600
leadership essential

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,420
Essentials course is an entry level for

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,640
managers leaders that want to transition

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,980
from traditional management towards

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,679
agile leadership the leadership that

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,320
agile teams scrum teams are looking

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,380
forward for the leadership that will

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,579
help them bloom that will help them

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,239
become

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,100
the best teams creating the best

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,539
possible products

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,340
so our current format typical format is

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,199
a simple I would say classical to Today

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:59,940
class today workshops

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:04,820
and in this format works pretty well if

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,820
you can focus for around 16 hours

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:12,540
and you have ability and support in your

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,560
organization to apply learnings from the

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,740
class

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,260
however what happens and it happened to

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,140
some of my students it might be

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,479
difficult to digest everything it might

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,580
be extremely difficult to come back

27
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,159
after those two days to your

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,360
professional environment and start

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,600
implementing changes I even remember my

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,079
course participant amazing women amazing

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,600
woman and she said oh my God Jana what

32
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,900
what I'm gonna do right now so many

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:51,259
Inspirations and now I feel overwhelmed

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:55,560
so I'm excited about immersive immersive

35
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:58,740
class this immersive initiative because

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,500
it it brings solutions to some of those

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,460
problems so instead of spending two days

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,060
together we have regular shorter modules

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:13,200
for instance every every week and we

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,020
focus on one area we learn we discuss

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,340
and then there is a break this break

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,379
will be used by our delegate to apply

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,940
learning in their professional

44
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,599
environment

45
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,940
so I believe it's it's no longer a

46
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,620
workshop it's rather a journey that

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:38,160
delegates choose to start with us and uh

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,739
I'm I'm super excited because I feel it

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,580
can help create a better relationship

50
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,879
between me and and of course participant

51
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,060
and I have a very strong feeling that I

52
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,760
can support my uh my course participants

53
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,180
better so I'm looking forward to to that

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,180
experience
