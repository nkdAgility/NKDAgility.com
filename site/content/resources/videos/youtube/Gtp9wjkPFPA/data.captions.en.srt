1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,759
so

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,580
how did devops and agile integrate I I

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,780
think of them as two sides of the same

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,300
coin

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,179
devops is in one side agiles on the

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,180
other side heads or tails they are

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,000
fundamentally the same thing

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,699
they are just looking at the same thing

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
from a different lens so one is looking

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,740
at the the the the the this thing from a

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,019
lens of

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,840
um um leadership and process in people

13
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,059
right that's the agile lens the other

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,880
one is the devops lens that is looking

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,480
at things from the perspective of

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,000
um and continuous delivery at lean and

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,120
Engineering right that's the two lenses

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,860
of the same thing so don't get hung up

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,980
on the difference between the two of

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,980
them
