So how did DevOps and Agile integrate? I think of them as two sides of the same coin. DevOps is on one side, Agile's on the other side. Heads or tails, they are fundamentally the same thing. They are just looking at the same thing from a different lens. 

One is looking at this thing from a lens of leadership and process in people, right? That's the Agile lens. The other one is the DevOps lens that is looking at things from the perspective of continuous delivery, lean, and engineering. Right? That's the two lenses of the same thing. 

So don't get hung up on the difference between the two of them.
