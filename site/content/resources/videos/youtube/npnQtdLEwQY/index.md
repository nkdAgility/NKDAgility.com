Technical debt is a term that often gets thrown around in our industry, but I want to clarify what it really means and how it impacts our products and processes. From my experience, technical debt is not just a buzzword; it represents a significant cost that can accumulate over time if not managed properly. 

### Understanding Technical Debt

At its core, technical debt refers to the implied cost of future rework that arises when we prioritise speed over long-term design. We often face a decision point when building a feature: do we take the fast route or the right route? Choosing the fast route is where we incur technical debt. This decision can be made deliberately by engineers, product leadership, or even the organisation as a whole.

However, it’s crucial to distinguish between technical debt and poor quality. While both can lead to rework and increased maintenance costs, they are not the same. Poor quality is simply that—poor quality. When teams say they have technical debt because of bugs, they might actually be referring to poor quality. This distinction is important because it affects how we address these issues.

### The Cost of Poor Quality

In my experience, poor quality is often the biggest killer of productivity and efficiency. It builds up over time, just like technical debt, but it stems from a lack of attention to detail and quality standards. C-suite executives are typically not interested in hearing about poor quality; they want high-quality products that satisfy users. Yet, engineering teams sometimes mischaracterise poor quality as technical debt, which can lead to a culture of complacency.

When we deliver a barely functioning product, we set ourselves up for failure. Building new features on top of a shaky foundation only compounds the problem. I’ve seen teams with a disproportionate number of manual testers compared to developers, which is a clear sign of poor quality. This situation is not sustainable and incurs massive costs.

### The Impact of Long Release Cycles

Long product cycles can exacerbate the issue. If you’re taking two years between releases, the last six months often devolve into a frantic bug-fixing spree. This isn’t true quality assurance; it’s more like patching up a product with sticky tape and super glue. The result is a product that may look good on the surface but is fundamentally flawed underneath.

Take Windows, for example. In the past, their lengthy release cycles led to significant technical debt. They would return to clean things up only to find that some issues had become integral to the product, making them difficult to resolve. The shift to continuous delivery has allowed teams to maintain quality and address technical debt proactively.

### Continuous Improvement and Refactoring

One of the best ways to manage technical debt is through continuous improvement. Teams should be encouraged to refactor and re-architect their products regularly. I recall a situation with the Azure DevOps team where a tightly coupled service caused a production incident. They realised that their architectural decisions had led to this problem and took steps to implement a circuit breaker pattern. This allowed them to isolate issues and prevent one service's failure from cascading through the system.

By continuously addressing technical debt, teams can avoid the pitfalls of poor quality and maintain a high standard for their products. It’s essential to set a minimum quality bar that protects the business, brand, employees, and customers. This is what I refer to as the organisation's "definition of done."

### The Benefits of Managing Technical Debt

Paying back technical debt pays dividends. It makes it easier to add new features, reduces customer issues, and ultimately leads to happier users. When customers have a positive experience with your product, they are more likely to remain loyal and contribute to your bottom line. 

In conclusion, managing technical debt is not just about fixing problems; it’s about creating a sustainable and efficient development process. By understanding the difference between technical debt and poor quality, and by committing to continuous improvement, we can minimise costs and maximise profits. Remember, the choices we make today will shape the quality of our products tomorrow. Let’s make those choices wisely.
