00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:10,710
hey Joshua I am just looking at how to

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,540
do that thing we just talked about so

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,130
you go to admin teams on microsoft.com

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,449
let's see and I drag this meeting

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,470
policies thing on to the other window

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,570
let's have a look

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,029
so I'm pretty sure it's gonna have to be

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,760
not in messaging policies but in meeting

9
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,320
policies I don't think it's meeting

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,600
settings let's check meeting settings

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,309
first anonymous users can join oh that's

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,910
nice

13
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:45,660
URLs quality of service so I think this

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,829
was off by default but I turned quality

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,449
of service on that may have had an

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:59,640
impact so let's have a look let's do the

17
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:03,629
global policy global policy okay

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:10,710
so somewhere in here where is the ah

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:12,060
there we go so media bitrate determines

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,950
the meaning of bitrate for audio video

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,990
or video without sharing a meeting

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,680
feeling organization the setting gives

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,080
your music really cool or my blah blah

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,720
blah the minimum value is 30 kilobytes

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,090
that would suck for meetings that need

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,829
the highest quality video experience

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,509
such as CEO board meetings and live

28
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:44,000
events we recommend you use 10 megabits

29
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:50,570
so this is in kilobits so convert a

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,250
little bit let's see what it comes with

31
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,060
okay so that's already set to 50

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:03,509
megabits again I may have changed that

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:06,450
you wanna go check and see 10 mega rez

34
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,239
yep so I might set 50 megabits that's

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,870
the policy that you want to go check on

36
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,769
and make sure that things are enabled

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,670
I also enable most of the features that

38
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:25,349
allow guests and people coming into the

39
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,200
meeting to do a bunch of things and so

40
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,760
this one is deliberately off because I

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,920
don't want anonymous people being able

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,959
to start the meeting or get in so if I

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,620
were just a meeting invite and honor

44
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,970
those people if I have our team's event

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:45,840
then I set it up so that only

46
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,569
authenticated people can join and I can

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,410
show you how to do that I have some

48
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:55,079
explanation of that and you can also

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,739
control like our lobby waiting room if

50
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:02,310
you want but since every team's URL is

51
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,349
unique it's a little bit different from

52
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:12,650
zoo where you have one URL and that

53
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:12,650
covers everybody okay
