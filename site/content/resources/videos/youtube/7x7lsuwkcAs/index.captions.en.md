Hey Joshua, I am just looking at how to do that thing we just talked about. So you go to admin teams on microsoft.com. Let's see, and I drag this meeting policies thing onto the other window. Let's have a look. 

So I'm pretty sure it's gonna have to be not in messaging policies but in meeting policies. I don't think it's meeting settings. Let's check meeting settings first. Anonymous users can join. Oh, that's nice. 

URLs, quality of service. So I think this was off by default, but I turned quality of service on. That may have had an impact. So let's have a look. Let's do the global policy. Global policy, okay. 

So somewhere in here, where is the... Ah, there we go. So media bitrate determines the meaning of bitrate for audio, video, or video without sharing a meeting feeling organisation. The setting gives your music really cool or my blah blah blah. The minimum value is 30 kilobytes. That would suck for meetings that need the highest quality video experience, such as CEO board meetings and live events. We recommend you use 10 megabits. 

So this is in kilobits, so convert a little bit. Let's see what it comes with. Okay, so that's already set to 50 megabits. Again, I may have changed that. You wanna go check and see. 10 mega rez. Yep, so I might set 50 megabits. That's the policy that you want to go check on and make sure that things are enabled. 

I also enable most of the features that allow guests and people coming into the meeting to do a bunch of things. And so this one is deliberately off because I don't want anonymous people being able to start the meeting or get in. So if I were just a meeting invite and honour those people, if I have our team's event, then I set it up so that only authenticated people can join. 

And I can show you how to do that. I have some explanation of that, and you can also control like our lobby waiting room if you want. But since every team's URL is unique, it's a little bit different from Zoom, where you have one URL and that covers everybody.
