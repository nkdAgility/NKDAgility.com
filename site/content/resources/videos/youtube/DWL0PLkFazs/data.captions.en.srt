00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,490
my name is Kathryn Maddox and I am

2
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,799
astonishingly

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,969
healthy i what advice - compared to

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,500
training because I've linked them from

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:23,119
the first time with books high energy

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,769
pragmatics and really interesting and

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,560
really glad we did because even the

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,369
worst skeptics in the crowd were won

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,440
over and not shopped yeah I'm not

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:40,379
suggesting and I'm the CTO and calm so

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,469
after a lot evaluation of differences

12
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:49,469
from creating options we selected Martin

13
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:53,850
because I think he brings a unique

14
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,399
perspective they very close to what I

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,070
call the beakers engineer the dragons

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,170
are makers and he gains a great

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,570
perspective that's close to the makers

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,930
to the skunk reading session which is

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,060
what is thought about how about you know

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,700
everything else is hard making sure the

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,400
details of the builders are successfully

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,170
doing their best work and I think mine

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,170
does a great job in connecting with them

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,220
