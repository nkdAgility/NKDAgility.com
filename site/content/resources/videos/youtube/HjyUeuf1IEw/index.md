As I sit here in my office, I’m excited to share some insights from my recent experiences in the world of Agile training and the innovative approaches we’re adopting to enhance our learning environments. This week, I want to delve into a couple of key topics: the new training programme I’ve launched and the concept of continuous forecasting, which I discussed with Daniel Vacanti during our recent Professional Scrum with Kanban class.

### Office Hours and Engagement

Every Wednesday at 6 p.m. BST, I host office hours where I’m available to answer your questions. This is a fantastic opportunity for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Agile practices or seeking advice on specific challenges they face in their teams. I encourage you to join in, whether live or by submitting questions in advance. If you prefer anonymity, there’s a simple form you can fill out—no identification required.

### Virtual Training Setup

Over the past few months, I’ve been conducting all my classes virtually, and I must say, it’s been a rewarding experience. I’ve taught various courses, including Professional Scrum Foundations and Professional Agile Leadership, using Microsoft Teams. This platform has proven to be incredibly effective for managing classes, offering features like breakout rooms, file sharing, and persistent channels for ongoing interaction with students.

Here’s a quick overview of how I prepare for these classes:

- **Tech Checks**: A week before each class, I conduct a tech check to ensure everyone can connect seamlessly. This involves guiding participants on how to log in correctly, as there are multiple ways to access Teams, and I want to avoid any hiccups on the day.
  
- **Utilising Tools**: We also use Mural, a digital whiteboarding tool, which allows for interactive sessions. I ensure that all outputs from our sessions are accessible to students post-class, enhancing their learning experience.

- **Reification Sessions**: I’ve introduced what I call “reification sessions” two weeks after the class. This is a chance for students to revisit concepts, discuss challenges they’ve encountered, and solidify their understanding. It’s an informal yet valuable way to reinforce learning.

### Continuous Forecasting

Now, let’s talk about continuous forecasting. This concept emerged during our Professional Scrum with Kanban class, and it’s a game-changer for how we approach sprint planning and daily scrums. 

The Scrum Guide doesn’t mandate that we plan our entire sprint upfront. Instead, it emphasises having enough of a plan to get started. This means we can adopt a more flexible approach, focusing on the immediate next steps rather than trying to predict every task for the entire sprint. Here’s how I suggest we can implement this:

- **Start Small**: Begin with a plan for the next few days, allowing the team to adapt as they progress. This dynamic planning approach helps teams respond to changes more effectively.

- **Utilise Metrics**: Professional Scrum teams should leverage metrics from the Kanban guide, such as throughput, cycle time, work in progress, and work item aging. These metrics provide valuable insights that can inform our planning and forecasting.

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: By collecting and analysing these metrics, teams can perform Monte Carlo simulations to predict outcomes more accurately. This statistical approach can help in understanding potential delivery timelines and managing stakeholder expectations.

### Conclusion

As we continue to navigate the complexities of Agile training and implementation, I’m committed to providing valuable resources and support to help teams thrive. If you’re interested in exploring training opportunities, please visit Naked Agility, where you’ll find a range of accredited classes designed to enhance your Agile journey.

I look forward to seeing you in my office hours or in one of my upcoming classes. Let’s keep the conversation going, and together, we can foster a deeper understanding of Agile practices that truly make a difference in our organisations. Thank you for joining me today!
