1
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,920
okay looks like we are online today in

2
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,360
my office hours I'm going to talk a

3
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,410
little bit about a new program that I

4
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,230
have for training as well as something

5
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:51,090
that I talked with Daniel Vacanti with

6
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,700
it the professional scrum with Kanban

7
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,300
class that we just had on Monday Tuesday

8
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,220
called continuous forecasting that can

9
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,890
help our software engineering team

10
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:05,910
during their daily scrum and part of

11
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,220
sprint planning to figure out more about

12
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,220
what's going on to you in a minute

13
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,610

16
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:37,240
okay so um the things that I want to

17
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,580
talk about first off I'm here to answer

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,750
questions

19
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,650
every Wednesday I'm at 6 p.m. BST

20
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,110
British summer time I'm going to be

21
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,320
trying to keep to that schedule at 6

22
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,330
o'clock on Wednesdays we'll see how well

23
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,940
that goes I shared it deliberately so

24
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,850
that it didn't fit on top of any classes

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,200
that I was doing but hopefully it will

26
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:07,810
be ok

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,239
if you have any questions please put

28
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,480
them if you're talking if you're here

29
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,280
life watching life please add them to

30
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,950
the chat stream I should be able to see

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,360
chats as you add them they might be a

32
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,340
little bit of a delay but I should be

33
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,500
able to see them if you want me to

34
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,830
answer a question um next week Wednesday

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,980
6 p.m. then please ask the question

36
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:39,130
anyway and I'll get to it in whatever

37
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,130
the next weekly second is I keep are a

38
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,350
bunch of stickies here with the the

39
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,459
questions that I've been asked and what

40
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,500
what we're going to talk about and if

41
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,130
you have a question that you don't want

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:57,340
anybody to know that you've asked so you

43
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:02,519
want to do an anonymous question then

44
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:06,910
you can use this link right here and

45
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,760
fill out a form just one text box it

46
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,959
doesn't ask for any identification and

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,560
off you go

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,820
so that will be awesome remember as well

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,090
the easiest way to get to the schedule

50
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:25,120
for this is to use YouTube so you go to

51
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:28,060
my channel on YouTube which you will

52
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,330
find by just searching for Nick agility

53
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,520
on YouTube no problem at all

54
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,510
you might be wondering why I look a

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,770
little bit weird you might see my lovely

56
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,949
covert cut

57
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,110
and which isn't even even I think I've

58
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,300
not even got it even this was my first

59
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,710
attempt at a haircut for myself I was

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,110
looking more and more like Lemony

61
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,360
Snicket from a series of unfortunate

62
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,810
events so I decided that there there

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,539
needed to be some cottage

64
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,720
unfortunately the cut was not super

65
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:08,199
successful so you can have a nice laugh

66
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,750
in fact if I do a little spin is just as

67
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,539
bad at the back and oh my goodness me I

68
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,120
just saw the back for the first time and

69
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:19,030
yeah okey-dokey

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,330
so my wife will hopefully be fixing that

71
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,630
at some point so the things that I want

72
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,340
to talk about and I've been teaching all

73
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,610
of my classes virtually we've done two

74
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,659
PSFS

75
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,449
professional scrum foundations so far

76
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,789
professional agile leadership and

77
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,190
professional scrum master which I did

78
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:45,069
for a program at wiggling in Oslo as

79
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:48,460
well as a professional scrum with Kanban

80
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:53,289
that I taught on Monday Tuesday there so

81
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:56,190
and we're kind of getting spun up on the

82
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:59,610
ideas around how do we deliver classes

83
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,199
virtually and I've got my set up

84
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,180
everybody seems to have their own set up

85
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,159
which is fine if whatever works for each

86
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,490
individual trainer and their students

87
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:11,800
I've been using Microsoft teams to

88
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,560
manage that and it's been working really

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,020
well because you know teams doesn't just

90
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,250
have you know you're on a call and then

91
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,659
you have breakout rooms it has

92
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:25,029
persistence and it has files it has

93
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:27,039
permissions it has a way for me to share

94
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:30,250
and interact with students on a

95
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,449
long-term basis and what I've been doing

96
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,340
and when you add a event to team

97
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,590
everybody in the team is invited if

98
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,659
you're added to the team later you get

99
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,509
invited so it's really handy for me as a

100
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,460
trainer I can just add people and to the

101
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,289
team and then they get all of the the

102
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,300
things they need to figure out how to

103
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,500
join the class I had to get in so what

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,150
I've been doing is kind of the week

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,750
before the class I

106
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:59,470
doing a tech check so that's been sent

107
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,690
out and we've gone over how to connect

108
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,090
two teams correctly because there is

109
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,310
more than one way to connect two teams

110
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,560
if you just click a meeting link and

111
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,320
you're probably coming in as an

112
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,450
unauthenticated user which means you

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,790
have very restricted permissions you can

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,070
participate in the meeting but you can't

115
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,230
access any of the other assets in the

116
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,960
organization which makes perfect sense

117
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,530
and however when I'm running the class

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,300
we use multiple channels for breakout

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,840
rooms we upload files we have

120
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,490
applications and tabs that give the

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
students some extra information or some

122
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,830
extra interactivity so we need students

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,770
to come in as an authenticated user and

124
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,650
depending on how they're doing that it

125
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,590
depends on how much of a struggle that

126
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:51,520
is and usually it's perfectly fine if

127
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,830
you're somebody who gives me to add the

128
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,950
email address that is your corporate

129
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,610
identity same as you would log in to

130
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,320
office 365 in your company then and you

131
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,710
will just have a completely seamless

132
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,150
experience using you use your corporate

133
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,190
login and I don't have to have any login

134
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,960
details at all just your email address

135
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,460
you accept the invitation and then

136
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,740
you're able to come in so that works

137
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,230
works really well you effectively just

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,450
log in in the same way that you would if

139
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:28,720
you were if you were coming in from AK

140
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,790
to one of your own corporate systems so

141
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,740
that works great the other option is

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,280
people use a Microsoft account so they

143
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,890
already have an outlook.com or xbox comm

144
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,870
or a hot meal and address that they've

145
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,960
had for many years they can give me that

146
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,520
they log in with their credentials and I

147
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,530
don't need to store any credential still

148
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,490
they'll log in with them and that's fine

149
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:53,470
and then the third one is and you still

150
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,290
need a Microsoft account to actually try

151
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,450
to get onto our Google and the Google

152
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,900
meet at the other day and you have to

153
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,090
provide Google credentials so I have an

154
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,380
email address that's enabled for Google

155
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,750
even though it's not a Google email

156
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,870
address and you can do the same thing

157
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,450
with Microsoft so you can take any email

158
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,170
address that's not a corporate identity

159
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,900
and not currently a Microsoft identity

160
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,900
so it could be you know your your gmail

161
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:27,100
account or Yahoo or AOL or whatever that

162
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,690
is and if I add that email address you

163
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,090
when you go to log in and claim the the

164
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,520
identity will be asked to follow some

165
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,140
steps to enable that it's usually pretty

166
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,330
straightforward but it sometimes just

167
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,160
takes a little bit of explaining and so

168
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,490
we do a tech check the week before and

169
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,350
it's probably 30 minutes depending on

170
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:53,380
the level of knowledge that users

171
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:57,280
already have with teams but I've not had

172
00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:01,450
any problems so far teaching all the

173
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,640
classes the other thing that we go

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,750
through is mural and we use a tool

175
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,270
called mural which is a digital

176
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,850
whiteboarding tool and it works pretty

177
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,090
well it has its own idiosyncrasies just

178
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:16,810
like any tool out there and there's

179
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,950
mural as well as mural and there's a

180
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,400
couple of other tools out there that

181
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,280
folks women using whatever works and as

182
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,400
long as I like to be able to provide the

183
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,370
output so that the students can continue

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,830
to go and view the work that was done on

185
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,410
those services and so I download the

186
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,660
files upload them to the team and then

187
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,330
students can continue to get access

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,530
which is pretty good the other thing

189
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,900
that I've been doing as well as the tech

190
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:47,650
check before is something that I'm

191
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:51,910
called I'm kind of calling reification

192
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:55,330
where we're going to work together to

193
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,010
solidify some of the ideas and so I've

194
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,530
only built it as an error at the moment

195
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,610
two weeks after the class and ultimately

196
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,020
ultimately

197
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,030
effectively when you when you takes

198
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,720
class from scrum de-torque through

199
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,350
myself you get two attempts whatever

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,770
assessments you get at the end

201
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,710
assessments while not being valuable to

202
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,570
identify somebody else's skill level it

203
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,540
might be useful in understanding your

204
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,160
own skill level and what are the areas

205
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,030
where you might want to go read up and

206
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,050
figure out so the idea is that students

207
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:33,860
get two weeks to take the assessment and

208
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,180
if they fail they get another attempt

209
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,280
but only if they take it within two

210
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,750
weeks so the idea is my reification

211
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,530
session which is just let's let's

212
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,320
discuss the things you don't know or

213
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,420
that you've tried to do some things in

214
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,820
your organization what what are the

215
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,820
problems that you've hit and just spend

216
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,100
an hour hitting on whatever questions

217
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,590
that folks from that particular class

218
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,680
have so that's a new experiment that I'm

219
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:06,560
running to see if we can't add value

220
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,180
there and I think that would be sounds

221
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,630
like I just think it's gonna be a lot of

222
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,370
fun it's a very easy value add and in

223
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,470
the circumstance of we're all at home

224
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,330
anyway and I've been booking in over

225
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,680
lunchtime UK time so I would do you know

226
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:27,140
be conscious of other people's time

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,180
zones so if I'm teaching in PST at

228
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,710
Pacific time then I'm not going to book

229
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,430
it at lunch side my time because you'd

230
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:36,740
still be in bed but I'm going to do that

231
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:40,790
so I might experiment with some

232
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,700
additional engagements with students

233
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,140
after the class and but hopefully this

234
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,200
will work out and then we'll be able to

235
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:53,450
add a bunch more so that comes to and

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:58,040
the thing that I was going to talk about

237
00:12:53,450 --> 00:13:00,560
which is continuous or casting um so

238
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,080
that's the only thing on my list today

239
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,110
it was something that came up during the

240
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:11,050
professional scrum with Kanban and it's

241
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:15,020
the idea that in in the scrum guide

242
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:18,530
there is nothing which says you have to

243
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:22,220
plan your whole sprint it says that you

244
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,000
have to have enough of a plan coming out

245
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,950
of your

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,930
and sprint planning to get started

247
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,760
that's all you need you need enough of a

248
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:35,150
plan to get started remember the team is

249
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,210
going to inspect their progress towards

250
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,430
their sprint goal every 24 hours at the

251
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:44,000
daily scrum and they're going to adapt

252
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,310
that plan as the goal so maybe we don't

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,380
need to plan the whole sprint and figure

254
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,680
out what all the tasks are maybe we just

255
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:55,190
need to start with a smaller plan

256
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,380
something you know the next couple of

257
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,570
days worth of work and then we're going

258
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:03,110
to build on that as we go I would maybe

259
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:06,170
take the current day plus two more same

260
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:08,510
as we use with planning the in the

261
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:12,920
product backlog and that will allow you

262
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:16,520
to to dynamically understand what you

263
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:19,220
can do and and maybe pull extra things

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,570
into your backlog maybe push some things

265
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,630
out depending on how things are going

266
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,589
and do that dynamically now one of the

267
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:32,290
tools to help with that and it's my

268
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:37,700
belief and that professional scrum teams

269
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:40,400
use the the the metrics from the Kanban

270
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,070
guide for scrum teams so they're going

271
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,680
to be using throughput they're going to

272
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:48,200
be using cycle time they're going to be

273
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,380
using work and process and they're going

274
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,540
to be using and work item aging those

275
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,120
are the four metrics that every

276
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,760
professional scrum team should be

277
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,480
collecting and if you're collecting that

278
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,210
data you would be able very easily to do

279
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,170
a for example Monte Carlo simulation I

280
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:13,430
think I have just an example and I'm

281
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:17,560
slight with a picture of a Monte Carlo

282
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,560
simulation from Daniels two-way

283
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,980
did that work yes it did oh let me just

284
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,980
put

285
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,740
you

286
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:48,460
that you want to add to this section I

287
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,520
am happy to take any questions and I see

288
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:55,179
that there at least I can't see and any

289
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,440
questions coming in on the channels let

290
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:00,220
me see if there's anything in the

291
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,380
anonymous there is not anything new in

292
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,510
the anonymous feedback either and I

293
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,960
think this will pick up once I get on a

294
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,659
regular schedule but hopefully you find

295
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,010
this useful to talk about continuous

296
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:15,460
forecasting and the ideas around having

297
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:19,030
a reification and a tech check for my

298
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,840
training so if you are looking for

299
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,549
training you can go to naked agility

300
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,830
comm that's where I list all of my

301
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,659
training classes and all the classes I'm

302
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,809
running at the moment are at scrum

303
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:35,320
dot-org accredited classes and so the

304
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:39,580
the official classes from scrammed and

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,710
org with assessments so please go there

306
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,590
and have a look if you want a private

307
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,260
class obviously we're not doing on-site

308
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,900
classes just now we can't really go

309
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,610
anywhere but we are doing at live

310
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,860
virtual classrooms I'm teaching a PSK

311
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:58,630
not PSK

312
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,049
professional scrum foundations class m

313
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:05,130
in dublin next week and then in

314
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:08,530
Pleasanton California the week after so

315
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,390
if you want private classes we can

316
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,190
deliver private classes pretty much

317
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,580
anywhere in the world in any timezone

318
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,260
and we just may need some preparation if

319
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,750
it's a crazy time zone I have one coming

320
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,559
up in New Zealand so that's going to be

321
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,059
a very tiring maybe experience or at

322
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,370
least it's gonna feel like I've get jet

323
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:29,470
lag for a couple of days as we figure

324
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,150
that out so please get in touch and

325
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,730
obviously if you want to ask your

326
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:38,100
