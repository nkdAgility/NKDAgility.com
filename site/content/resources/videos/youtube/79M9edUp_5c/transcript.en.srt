1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,400
from Masters love asynchronous

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,779
communication

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,940
um asynchronous communication is

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,400
something that has been become more

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,219
popular uh since lockdown right we're

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,379
able to collaborate with people in a

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,000
much more Dynamic manner we don't have

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,500
to wait for people to reply we don't

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,920
have to all be in the same place at the

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,660
same time all the time we can have these

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,019
back and forth communicate with people

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:32,719
engage with them on a constant basis and

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:36,300
it provides a much more uh uh compelling

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,820
way to facilitate communication without

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,559
imposing too much on people's time

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,960
because everybody's trying to get work

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,980
done as well and they can reply as

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,420
needed

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,420
asynchronous communication
