From Masters love asynchronous communication. Asynchronous communication is something that has become more popular since lockdown. Right, we're able to collaborate with people in a much more dynamic manner. We don't have to wait for people to reply. We don't have to all be in the same place at the same time all the time. We can have these back and forth, communicate with people, engage with them on a constant basis, and it provides a much more compelling way to facilitate communication without imposing too much on people's time. Because everybody's trying to get work done as well, and they can reply as needed. Asynchronous communication.
