1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,120
if you want to be able to ensure that

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,880
your software performs well and creates

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,639
a great user experience you're going to

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,120
have to put in a lot of effort in making

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,240
that happen it is not going to M you're

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,760
not going to magically has have awesome

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,600
software with an awesome experience and

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,080
F and and fast and responsive without

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,400
actually putting in the effort to figure

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,759
out how to do that and performance

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,079
engineering has a huge impact on user

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,239
satisfaction and and the business goals

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,360
you're trying to achieve right without a

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,320
focus on performance engineering and

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,440
this is also shifting left right towards

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,760
where the the the the team is doing the

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,960
work without without that you're

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,039
not you're not going to be able to build

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,359
you're not going to be able to build a

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,480
product that suits your customers

21
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:59,160
customers are going to leave because it

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,039
doesn't perform well or customers are

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,519
going to leave because it doesn't do

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,479
what they need it to do or customers are

25
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:09,159
going to leave because it's it's it's

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
buggy and doesn't you're not getting

27
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,159
things there fast enough right so

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
performance engineering where we're

29
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,759
looking at how

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,040
quickly users are able to do things and

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,600
that some of that some of that could be

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,920
user experience based taking steps out

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,280
of the process and some of it can be

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,759
does the software actually function at

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,640
speed does it function at load and while

36
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,759
some of these things can be load and

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:47,200
stress tested um I'm going to quote um

38
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,200
one of my favorite product managers and

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,159
Brian Harry who said there's no place

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,360
like

41
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,039
production no matter how

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,880
much

43
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:03,640
testing you do prior to production

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,079
you're going to have problems that only

45
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,239
exist in production you you can't

46
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,440
simulate real users it's not possible

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,560
you can only uh synthetically simulate

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
users so no matter how much of that

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
stuff you do you're going to have

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,319
problems when you hit production they

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
can be performance problems they can be

52
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,040
the way people use it problems right the

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,959
order that people do things or the

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,280
amount they do this particular thing is

55
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,959
different from what we had in the

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,760
simulation and that's where you run into

57
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,800
a lot of your your your Major

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,840
Performance

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,560
problems

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,440
My

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,640
Philosophy is that we want to get into

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,239
production as quickly as possible so

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,000
that we can figure out the impact of the

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,720
changes that we've made

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,360
and

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,000
analyze the load and stress test

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,200
within the context of real usage real

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,799
users using it for real and this is this

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,120
is the story of of testing in production

70
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,400
which doesn't mean you're not testing

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,879
before production holy moly no don't

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,000
ship stuff that's not tested to

73
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,680
production that's a bad idea right but

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
we need to get into production as

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,920
quickly as possible which means we need

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,879
to automate and create fast Sleek

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,959
automated testing for all of the normal

78
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,840
stuff that we need to test right does

79
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,959
the software actually function the way

80
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,959
we expect it to and then we want a ring

81
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,439
based or audience-based deployment model

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,200
so that we can control the exposure of

83
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,879
these new capabilities and features and

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,840
we do load and stress testing

85
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,159
effectively in production so what that

86
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,879
might look like I'm going to use an

87
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,920
example because I I I love the way that

88
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,079
they've done this so I I've worked a lot

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,200
in the past with the Azure devops team

90
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:15,000
at Microsoft um as your devops seeing

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,840
how they do things has been really

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,799
really really enlightening because they

93
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,680
they've got quite a big product it's

94
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,560
quite a big scaling problem they've got

95
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,199
millions of users and what they

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,320
effectively do

97
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:33,680
is they have some some of the rings that

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,759
you're deploying to are physical Rings

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
like

100
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:41,440
environments but even once you've

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,000
deployed a new capability to all of your

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
production environments let's say you

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,039
have

104
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,639
six areas around the world you've

105
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:54,440
deployed to them all those features that

106
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,160
are deployed might not be accessible by

107
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,240
people right so they're not impacting

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,919
production in any way they're off

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,360
feature flag is

110
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:08,080
off but

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,360
then they the team that owns that

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,479
feature that's deploying that feature

113
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,600
wants to ensure that that feature is

114
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,800
load tested stress tested is the right

115
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,039
and you've also got is the right thing

116
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
right is the right thing resonates with

117
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,840
customers provides the right capability

118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:32,600
but also works load tested stress tested

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,520
and we agreed well I agreed uh that we

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,919
can't do load testing and stress testing

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,960
very well not in production so what we

122
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,960
need to be able to do is we need to a be

123
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,600
able to limit the number of users that

124
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,680
are accessing this new feature and then

125
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,280
expand it over time so there's various

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,639
ways to do that what they would do is

127
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,199
their first ring that they would create

128
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
and this is actually a ring for each

129
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,639
feature

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
so they they're creating an

131
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,800
audience-based deployment model per

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,000
feature if it's big enough right you

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,440
might have features that you just ship

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,840
you might have changes that you just

135
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,560
ship you don't do this with everything

136
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,840
this is expensive right but what they do

137
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,639
is the team will go ah we want to start

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,000
getting real users into kicking the

139
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,240
tires on this feature it's just us so

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,960
far just internal people so what we're

141
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,440
going to do is we're going to publish a

142
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,639
blog post so they publish a blog post

143
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,960
that says we're working on this new

144
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,840
feature it's it's it's going to provide

145
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,599
this capability here's what it Curr

146
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,520
looks like and if you would like to help

147
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:38,880
us kick the tires send an email to this

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,360
email address and we'll we'll with your

149
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,800
account name and and your your either

150
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,039
org an account or just org or just

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,080
account depending on how they're how

152
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,199
they're doing it so you give them the

153
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,880
data of who you are and then they enable

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,560
it for you so you can then go in the

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,039
tool you would then have a little

156
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,680
feature flag that you can turn on and

157
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,720
off so you can choose to turn it off and

158
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
when you turn choose to turn it off when

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,280
you choose to turn it off it's you get

160
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,960
asked for a comment and it goes to the

161
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,960
the team right so they can find out why

162
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,360
you don't like it right why you're not

163
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,360
using it it's slow it's this it's that

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
and then they can go look at the

165
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Telemetry but that's that's a very

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,800
private preview right people have to

167
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,000
actively opt in once they have enough

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,960
data to say that they think this is a

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,560
good feature they think it performs well

170
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,479
at least with the small number of users

171
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,840
once we have enough telemetry they then

172
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,319
open it out and they'll turn it they'll

173
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,039
have it off for everybody that's using

174
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,800
the service but with the feature flag

175
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,199
enabled for everybody so everybody can

176
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,120
go turn it on and they'll do another

177
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
blog post that says we're now ready for

178
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,199
more people to try this you don't have

179
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
to email us anymore you can just go

180
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,240
switch it on go try it out and tell us

181
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,520
what you think so that encourages a

182
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,039
bunch of people to go turn it on and

183
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,680
then they get a bunch of telemetry for

184
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,520
people using it and either people then

185
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
continue to use it or they turn it off

186
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,720
because they don't like it right maybe

187
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,800
it overrides the existing functionality

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,000
and they don't like the way it is

189
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,639
because something's missing so they got

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,680
to turn it off they're asked what the

191
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,039
problem is they type in I don't like it

192
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,360
because it's slow I don't like it

193
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:15,520
because there's features missing I don't

194
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
like it because I don't like my cheese

195
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,680
being moved whatever the reason is

196
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,120
right and that's they then collecting

197
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,840
more Telemetry and if they get enough

198
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
data they maybe go to the next stage or

199
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,599
maybe they need to do more things more

200
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,360
iterations on the the the capabilities

201
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,839
improve the performance maybe they need

202
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,959
to turn it off because it's not

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,120
performing well and then they need to do

204
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,159
some performance improvements and then

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,320
turn it back on again eventually if

206
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,720
they've got enough Telemetry they'll

207
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,240
turn it on by default for everybody with

208
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,000
the option for people to go in and turn

209
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,000
it off so everybody gets it forcibly

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,320
turned

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,080
on and then we're collecting data and

212
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,240
Telemetry from the people that turn it

213
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,200
off to find out why they don't like it

214
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,000
why why do they go turn it off what do

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,959
we need to do to get those folks on

216
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,200
board once they have enough Telemetry

217
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,959
they see there's not so many people

218
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,480
turning it off there always going to be

219
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,880
people that don't like what you're doing

220
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,560
right so you can't it's not a unanimous

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,959
thing they then have it on by default

222
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,560
you can't turn it off right they maybe

223
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,040
disable the option to turn it off see

224
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,320
what complaints roll in for people that

225
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
want to be able to turn it off and then

226
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,079
eventually they get rid of the feature

227
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,480
FL and it's on for everybody in

228
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:38,079
production that's

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,560
a modern software engineering

230
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,959
implementation of continuous delivery to

231
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,600
production and then an audience-based

232
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,680
roll out and expansion and testing story

233
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
to allow you to do load testing and

234
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,760
performance testing and stress testing

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,839
in

236
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,480
production that takes discipline that

237
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,839
takes

238
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,360
effort it's definitely

239
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,880
has a cost right there's a lot of things

240
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,399
that had to happen there and things that

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,320
had to be organized and things that had

242
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
to be

243
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,079
done but aure

244
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,600
devops using that capability that they

245
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:20,600
built into the system using that story

246
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:24,120
they created a massive following from

247
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,720
their users that their users expected

248
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,959
Excellence expected new things expected

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,640
those new things to work and and as

250
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,880
those new things rolled out cuz you have

251
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,079
an expectation if you op opt into a

252
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,519
private preview that there might be some

253
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,519
you know things that don't work quite as

254
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,560
well or we don't know yet right so

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,440
you're not testing in production with

256
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,760
users that haven't chosen to be part of

257
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,279
that test story right you're soliciting

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,279
for people to come in and help you and

259
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,000
because they want to help you one

260
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,000
they're more forgiving and they'll give

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,440
more feedback right because they're

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,560
choosing to be there and that's how you

263
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,480
create a a story of performance

264
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,519
improvements and enhancing user

265
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,120
experience in a progressive modern

266
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,800
engineering Excellence Manner and this

267
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,800
is something that naked agility can help

268
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,360
you build within your teams build within

269
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,519
your product don't expect it to be

270
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,360
magically overnight these things take

271
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,480
effort they take discipline sometimes

272
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,360
mistakes are made but with uh a focus on

273
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,440
delivering high quality usable working

274
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,639
product continuously to our users we can

275
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,200
build some of the best products you've

276
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,200
ever seen
