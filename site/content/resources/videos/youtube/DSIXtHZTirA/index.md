# Performance Engineering and Testing in Production: A Modern Approach | Martin Hinshelwood  

‚Ää üìç  üìç Naked Agility can be your partner in creating engineering excellence and technical leadership within your organization. In the last few videos we've talked about a number of different ways or things that we focus on that are part of, part of that story. We talked about that, that High cost of, of, of bad quality of mediocre product, right?

Not even mediocre, poor quality product. There's lots of poor quality products out there that have a massive cost, particularly in your brand recognition, right? People don't want to use products that they have envisaged in their head to be of poor quality. We talked a lot about shifting left and the different Components that we would shift left, not just testing and test automation,  continuous integration, continuous delivery.

We talked about user experience shifting left, we talked about security shifting left, architecture shifting left. All of these things need to move as close to the engineering team that's Making the decisions, the people that are making the decisions and doing the work, all of those things, those skills, those capabilities, those not need to be built up in those teams in order for you to move towards this idea of engineering excellence, right?

We, we, we need to not manage technical debt, but. Pay it back, deal with it, deal with the technical debt when it happens, own up to it when we make a mistake,  transparent and open about what the problem was and what we're going to do it, and build that culture of quality, build that culture of engineering excellence within our organization.
