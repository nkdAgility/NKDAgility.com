 # Performance Engineering and Testing in Production: A Modern Approach | Martin Hinshelwood  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I explore the critical role of **performance engineering** and how to ensure your software delivers a great user experience. From optimizing for speed and responsiveness to leveraging real-world testing in production, Iâ€™ll share actionable strategies for creating modern, high-quality products that keep customers happy and businesses thriving.

**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Performance Engineering Matters  
2. 03:00 â€“ Shifting Left: Empowering Teams to Own Performance  
3. 06:30 â€“ Testing in Production: Balancing Risk and Value  
4. 09:45 â€“ The Importance of Telemetry and User Feedback  
5. 14:00 â€“ Feature Flags and Audience-Based Deployment  
6. 18:30 â€“ Real-World Example: Azure DevOpsâ€™ Testing Strategy  
7. 24:00 â€“ Building Discipline in Modern Software Engineering  

**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  

- Software engineers and architects focusing on performance optimization  
- Product managers and business leaders aiming to improve user satisfaction  
- Teams implementing feature flags and audience-based deployment models  
- Organizations wanting to adopt modern performance and testing strategies  

**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  

- How performance engineering impacts user satisfaction and business goals  
- Why testing in production is essential and how to manage its risks  
- The role of telemetry in identifying and solving performance issues  
- How audience-based deployments improve feedback and reduce risks  
- Practical insights from Azure DevOpsâ€™ modern engineering practices  
- Steps to build discipline and effort into performance improvement  

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  

- Great performance and user experience require intentional effort and discipline.
