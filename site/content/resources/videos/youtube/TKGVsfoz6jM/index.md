You don’t need to know everything. You need to know what matters. That might sound obvious, but if you’re a CTO right now, it’s hard to believe. New frameworks, new tools, AI models dropping weekly—every conversation feels like a pop quiz you didn’t study for. And under it all, there’s that quiet fear: if you’re not on top of every trend, every shift, you’re falling behind.

Let’s be clear, that’s not leadership. That’s FOMO, and it’s exhausting.

I’ve seen this play out time and again. I’ve sat with CTOs who are drowning in information, feeling the pressure to have an answer for everything. The reality is, you can’t—and you shouldn’t—try to keep up with every shiny new thing. The real skill is knowing what to ignore.

Here’s what I’ve learned working with technology leaders across industries:

- **You don’t need to know it all.** You need to know what matters for your context, your business, your teams.
- **Not every trend deserves your attention.** Some things can wait. Others are critical. The trick is knowing the difference.
- **Leadership is about clarity, not omniscience.** It’s about making peace with not knowing everything, and focusing on what will actually move the needle.

So, how do we get there? How do we cut through the noise and focus on what matters?

### Mapping Your Systems of Work

The first step is to get clear on your systems of work. I work with CTOs to map out how value actually flows through their organisation. Where are the bottlenecks? What are the strategic constraints? Which technical capabilities are holding you back, and which are enabling your teams to deliver?

This isn’t about creating a pretty diagram for the boardroom. It’s about uncovering the real levers for change. When you see your system clearly, you can stop reacting to every new tool or framework and start making intentional decisions.

### Filtering the Noise

There’s always a new trend, a new tool, a new “must-have” technology. The temptation is to chase them all, but that’s a recipe for burnout and mediocrity. Instead, I help leaders develop a filter:

- **Does this trend solve a real problem we have?**
- **Will it help us deliver better outcomes for our customers?**
- **Is it aligned with our strategy, or is it just a distraction?**

Most things can wait. A few things are critical. The art is in knowing which is which.

### Leading with Clarity and Intent

The CTOs who thrive aren’t the ones who know everything. They’re the ones who lead with clarity and intent. They focus on outcomes, not outputs. They create space for their teams to experiment and learn, without feeling the need to have all the answers themselves.

Here’s my advice:

- **Embrace not knowing.** It’s a sign of maturity, not weakness.
- **Get clear on your constraints.** Focus your energy where it will have the most impact.
- **Lead with purpose.** Your job isn’t to chase every trend—it’s to create an environment where your teams can deliver real value.

In the end, staying relevant isn’t about knowing it all. It’s about knowing what matters, and having the courage to focus on it. That’s real leadership.
