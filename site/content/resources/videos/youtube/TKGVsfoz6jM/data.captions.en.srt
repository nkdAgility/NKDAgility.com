sound obvious but if you're a CTO right

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,480

new tools AI models dropping loot weekly

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,080
every conversation feels like a pop quiz

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,480
you didn't study for and under it all

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,480
that quiet

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,439
fear if you're not on top of every trend

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
every shift you're falling

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,120

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,719
leadership that's FOMO and it's

identify the technical capabilities that

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,160
will move the

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,719
needle we filter out the noise fast not

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,760

things can wait others are critical we

help you know the difference so instead

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,960
of reacting to everything you focus on

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,920
what drives outcomes that's how you stay

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,320
relevant not by knowing it at all but by

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
leading with clarity and intent
