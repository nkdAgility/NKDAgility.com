opportunity to talk

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,320
about story points and velocity

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,079
uh this session is an experimental topic

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,280

able to

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,040
make it on there we go i've got a couple

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
of people

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,760
i have awesome i have visiting penguin

68
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,319
visiting crab and visiting pig awesome

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,440
so um what i'd like you to do

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
is i'm going to put a a timer for two

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,680
minutes but if you see there's an

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
outline

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
on the top right of the mural um and you

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,040
should be able to click

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
uh measuring progress and that will take

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
you to

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,239
uh oh thank you visiting penguin is

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,200
following me um i will summon

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
everybody to this uh uh summon everybody

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,000
there we go

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,200
so what i'd i'd like to do uh first

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,920
is a little exercise where um

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,959
i'd like you to tell me what techniques

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,920
you have used uh to measure

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
progress within a sprint and maybe other

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,319
techniques

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,400
that you've heard of as well and i'd

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,760
like to create a sticky for each

89
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
method so i'm actually i'm just going to

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,040
put a timer on for two minutes so we

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
don't spend

92
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,000
at too long doing things

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,879
but i'd like you to create as many

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
stickies as you can within that

95
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
measuring

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,280
progress uh box so i'm gonna give you

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,840
that

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,080
two minute timer which is now one minute

99
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,159
45.

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
and i'll maybe start it off oh that's a

101
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
good point if you don't know how to

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
create a sticky

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,640
using this tool uh you double click

104
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,360
anywhere on the screen

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
and it will just create one absolutely

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,880
there we go so there's

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,720
a visiting pig is creating one

108
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,600
and visiting uh bird which is jessica

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,040
um is having it go as well so you just

110
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
double click anywhere

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,520
and type in yep burn down

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,160
is definitely a tool that i've seen uh

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,160
teams use

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,840
any other tools

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,600
so for the sake of the recording i'm

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,400
gonna bring this

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
over to the share uh there's about a

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,560
minute left

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
burn down chart burn up what about

120
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,440
metrics what about points of data what

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
sort of

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
other ways are there to measure is it

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,039
just burn down what do you plot on a

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,039
burn down

125
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,400
number of defects i like that one that's

126
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
that's one i've seen before

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,320
uh let's see

128
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,840
work until meeting the sprint goal user

129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,160
stories closed by day

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,160
cool

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
nobody has mentioned story points

132
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,479
remaining story points that's a good one

133
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,400
so the story points must be a metric

134
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
inside of that

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,919
okay work in process thank you very much

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,120
whoever that was uh so we have a number

137
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,600
of things

138
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
that that folks have entered uh burn

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
down chart

140
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,560
uh work work until meeting the sprint

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,960
goal

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
um so i'm not sure how you're measuring

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,080
that or what data points you're using

144
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,759
with that i guess you would maybe look

145
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,240
at story points remaining maybe

146
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
or stories remaining or items remaining

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,960
uh we've got burn up

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,600
work in process user stories closed by

149
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,840
day

150
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
a number of defects created that can

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,120
definitely be a good measure but is

152
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,440
generally a measure of

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,479
quality rather than progress but um

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,160
they are all uh good measures so the

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
ones that i was

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,639
two that are i was surprised

157
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,759
were not on there our story points uh

158
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,560
and velocity are the two most

159
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
common ways it was implied in at least

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
one of the

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
the post-its uh so that does uh make

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
sense

163
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,360
so the the most popular uh method

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,160
for um doing that is story points and

165
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
velocity

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,639
and really story points and velocity are

167
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
are not they're not actually part of

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,479
scrum

169
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,160
uh there are a number of things that we

170
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,800
collectively

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,639
believe are required to do scrum and

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,120
these have been

173
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,400
perpetuated by a long-running

174
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
perseverance of trainers to the

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,160
to the training teaching to the lowest

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
common denominator

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
and trying to keep things as simple as

178
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,720
possible story points and velocity are

179
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
easy to understand they're easy to

180
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,759
implement they're easy to follow

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
um i would like to assert that they

182
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,440
don't provide as much value as

183
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,759
folks think they do um

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,199
there's a kind of a general consensus in

185
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
the trainer community

186
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,240
that folks that attend scrum training

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,800
are not smart enough to do anything else

188
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
and i would like to disagree i think

189
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
they are smart enough to do something

190
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,400
else

191
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
and whenever i teach scrum training i

192
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,680
always use different measures that we're

193
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
going to talk about

194
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
a little bit later i'm sure some of you

195
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,319
have already guessed

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
uh what i'm talking about but if you go

197
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,280
and have a look in the scrum guide you

198
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
can see i've i've

199
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
collected a couple of screenshots for

200
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,080
both velocity and story points neither

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
of which

202
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,680
are mentioned in scrum guide uh but

203
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,680
neither is burn down

204
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
neither is user story neither is

205
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,039
original estimate

206
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,280
bug count or actual versus completed

207
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,319
errors none of these things are

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,360
mentioned

209
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,360
in the scrum guide

210
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,080
i would say it's okay for a team to

211
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,640
start with story points and velocity

212
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
i've seen many teams get value out of

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,080
that

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,480
there are many things that change when a

215
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
team moves from traditional

216
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
project management practices of the past

217
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
to more

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
empirical practices of the present and

219
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,880
sometimes we

220
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
kind of need to pick our battles at one

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,920
such battle is that of story points and

222
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,560
velocity

223
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,320
and all of the other gubbins that goes

224
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
around with it that's maybe a very

225
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,360
british expression uh

226
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,680
gubbins is just all the other stuff

227
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,760
like if you're going to do story pines

228
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,440
and velocity you probably have some kind

229
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,399
of burn down you maybe have some kind of

230
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
burn up

231
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,080
um those kind of artifacts are part of

232
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
that

233
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
perhaps we do this because we need to

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,519
appease

235
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,440
other parts of the organization that are

236
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,399
not yet ready for change

237
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
uh perhaps we have to distance ourselves

238
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,920
from

239
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,440
data because we have uh

240
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,480
a traditional persecution

241
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
of the team by using

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
data of the past and that's that

243
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
original estimate versus actuals that i

244
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
see all the time

245
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,800
in organizations and we need to get

246
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,839
better at estimating by closing

247
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,959
closing that gap uh between original and

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,880
actuals

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,760
and it's just just not really tenable

250
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,519
while story points and velocity can be a

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,560
good starting point

252
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
they are not a good long-term

253
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
story um i'm not saying that there's no

254
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
value

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,040
in story points or planning poker that's

256
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
what this

257
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
uh team here is doing a little bit of

258
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,200
planning poker

259
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,800
um when a team is just starting out they

260
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
kind of do need to keep things

261
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,640
a little bit simple and iterate towards

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,320
better outcomes

263
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,160
we often start from typical traditional

264
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
practices and planning poker

265
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,600
is definitely a good learning point

266
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
stories

267
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,320
points use rough sizing as a way to

268
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,640
analyze work and break it down

269
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
because really the scores the the

270
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
numbers

271
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,279
that we get the points that we come up

272
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
with for stories

273
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,959
they're just made up like we always used

274
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,720
to they're a

275
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,000
a relative uh rough sizing thing

276
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
that allows us and enables our team

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
to get a shared understanding of the

278
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,640
work

279
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,920
it's about generating conversations

280
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,079
of understanding what we don't know that

281
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,200
other team members do know

282
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,000
and being able to come to a shared

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
understanding shared learning of what

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,839
those things are

285
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,959
and and that's awesome that's exactly

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,160
what we want

287
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,360
uh to achieve but i would assert that

288
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,920
we don't need to use those numbers

289
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,839
after that exercise that is definitely a

290
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,240
good exercise to have

291
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
but the story points and velocity um are

292
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,320
not super useful

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
because agile teams try to use story

294
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
points

295
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,600
and velocity for future predictability

296
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,800
uh to gain that level of predictability

297
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,360
and it's it's a total

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:56,720
fallacy uh that that is a valid thing

299
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,639
um while it would be okay for a team to

300
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
use it for a while if an agile team is

301
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,320
still

302
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,839
using velocity and story points

303
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,160
after uh they have 20 or 30 sprints

304
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,079
under their belt then i would have

305
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,120
serious concerns

306
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,240
about their ability

307
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,880
their ability to adapt uh to change

308
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,240
and their sincerity towards that change

309
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,519
in general

310
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,560
um teams using story points just don't

311
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,839
understand their work or its nature

312
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,399
this is what i mean by immaturity and

313
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,519
not

314
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,480
that something that's a sign of maturity

315
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,639
uh the opposite of that that's what i

316
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,040
mean by being an immature thing we just

317
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
don't

318
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,440
understand our work enough uh to have a

319
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,480
concrete measure

320
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
indeed uh the scrum team using story

321
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,959
points really has

322
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,360
at no constant consistent

323
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,800
reference points and they're just

324
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
shooting in the dark same as they were

325
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,320
before

326
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,480
this is very common and i believe it to

327
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
be an organizational dysfunction we pick

328
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,079
story points because of that

329
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,120
organizational immaturity and while they

330
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
have

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,800
in doing planning poker and

332
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
understanding those things

333
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,839
gained additional understanding of the

334
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,800
goals

335
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,839
of what those things are that we're

336
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
trying to achieve

337
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
what it is we're going to do they still

338
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
don't have an understanding of the

339
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,320
predictability

340
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
and thus they have no confidence in

341
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,279
their predictions

342
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,959
they may have false confidence but it's

343
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,320
not actual confidence

344
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,760
in their predictions we need

345
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,800
some concrete uh data

346
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,680
uh that we can use it to build

347
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,920
trust with our stakeholders that we know

348
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,720
what we're talking about at all

349
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,519
otherwise they may just take their money

350
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
elsewhere

351
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,800
and then we don't have additional work

352
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,040
we we need that level

353
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,760
of confidence so the traditional method

354
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,959
for

355
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,240
uh improving that level of confidence

356
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:08,199
is confidence is uh to

357
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,639
focus on that velocity

358
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:16,160
fluctuation and try and improve

359
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,880
uh that velocity fluctuation uh sorry

360
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
improve it

361
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
improves the team's position and have a

362
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,839
more

363
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,240
stable velocity so what i would like to

364
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,440
do

365
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,720
is there is a second question uh

366
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
here in the fluctuating velocity section

367
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
so if you click

368
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,959
fluctuating velocity on the right i will

369
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
summon

370
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,040
everybody i'm only going to put two

371
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,639
minutes i know it says three

372
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,880
uh but i'm going to put two minutes on

373
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,959
there and i'm going to ask that you

374
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,639
create a post-it

375
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,120
for everything that you could do with a

376
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
team

377
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:57,440
to help them improve their velocity

378
00:14:52,560 --> 00:15:01,440
stabilize it maybe make it bigger plus

379
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
make it more consistent

380
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,320
so i know there's a few people following

381
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,720
me but i'm just going to zoom in so i

382
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,399
can

383
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,440
read that a little bit better because it

384
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
was rather small

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,480
so work on commitment and optimistically

386
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,040
view

387
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:40,800
refinement now trying to put that reduce

388
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:43,759
waste yep

389
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,560
couldn't we uh restrict the team's

390
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,639
holidays

391
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,519
that's usually a good way to to have

392
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,880
more consistency

393
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
i'm just joking with that one

394
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,800
there's about 40 seconds left hit them

395
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,800
i don't know who was typing that but

396
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,680
that was visiting sea lion

397
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,320
let's let's wall up the team make them

398
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,639
work harder

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,160
focus on one thing instead of many

400
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,519
that's kind of getting to the

401
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,240
to the to the crux of it

402
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
focus on the sprint goal fixing

403
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
technical debt

404
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
that's definitely something we're going

405
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,600
to do

406
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,480
collaborative refinement a very powerful

407
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
technique

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,839
these are all really good techniques uh

409
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,639
i would be

410
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
concerned with focusing too much on

411
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,560
reducing

412
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,560
waste uh waste is

413
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
the elimination of waste is a lean

414
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,680
technique that applies

415
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,920
mostly to uh understood

416
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
work uh because we want to remove all

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,199
waste from the process like if we were

418
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
building a set of cars

419
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,519
uh um we're we've got a production line

420
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,120
and we want to eliminate

421
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,360
all waste waste in a creative endeavor

422
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
or things that look like waste in a

423
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,920
creative diver

424
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,439
are actually the thing that gives us

425
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,079
that little bit of friction

426
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
uh that creativeness of the development

427
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,400
team of building

428
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,760
uh interesting and powerful products uh

429
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,039
so i i like reducing waste

430
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,679
i just would be uh careful

431
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,520
with that technique i would reduce

432
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,439
technical debt that's a way to reduce

433
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,559
waste reducing rework

434
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,039
um have built testing

435
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,640
into the process rather than test after

436
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,679
which a lot of teams do

437
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,760
that will reduce waste as well so there

438
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,080
are definitely things we can do

439
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:45,039
to reduce waste but the reality is

440
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,320
if i can change that there we go your

441
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,760
velocity is

442
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,960
is going to fluctuate that is

443
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,960
just a fundamental uh reality

444
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,640
of uh the way we work velocity was a way

445
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,360
to kind of assert

446
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,039
that confidence with a plot of our

447
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,280
delivered story points

448
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,400
along with some clever calculations like

449
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
maybe uh

450
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,559
the mean or the mean of the worst three

451
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
and we assert that we're likely to

452
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,919
deliver about

453
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,240
20 story points this is such a wholly

454
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
improbable assumption that the vast

455
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,039
majority of scrum teams talk about

456
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,640
carryover points and quiz me on how to

457
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,320
represent that

458
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
do you re-estimate and stick it on the

459
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,919
backlog or did you just go straight into

460
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,280
the next sprint and do you chop it up

461
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
and do you get points for the stuff

462
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,200
you've just done in the previous sprint

463
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,039
even though you didn't finish it these

464
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
are all questions

465
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:46,000
that make visible

466
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,400
make transparent a fundamental problem

467
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,520
with the idea of story points and

468
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,480
velocity

469
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
in the first place scrum teams have been

470
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,559
basing their confidence

471
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,919
level that they talk to stakeholders

472
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,120
about

473
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,840
based on just an agreed consensus

474
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,039
that can't be compared between teams

475
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,840
can't be looked at

476
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,960
across an organization and it's

477
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,919
susceptible

478
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,440
to any sort of gaming you would like and

479
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,640
it's just made up in the team's

480
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
estimation room

481
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
so if you have a different person doing

482
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,840
the work

483
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,280
than was involved in estimating maybe

484
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,520
because there was some vacation time

485
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,640
and somebody who was critical to

486
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,360
creating

487
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
the understanding that we got during

488
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,760
refinement

489
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,120
is now they're off while when we go to

490
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,880
take this story

491
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,640
they're not available then um

492
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
it's going to take much longer than we

493
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,440
thought it was maybe some critical skill

494
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,000
is missing

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
maybe some critical insight is missing

496
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
we've shared our understanding as much

497
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
as possible but

498
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,760
we just don't have the confidence level

499
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
that we thought we did so we end up with

500
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
carryovers we end up with things

501
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,400
spilling over

502
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,200
into the next sprint in a way that is

503
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
untenable

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
i got this quote uh off at daniel

505
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,080
vicanti's

506
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,360
at twitter he actually gave me another

507
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
quote that i'm not going to use because

508
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,919
it's very rude

509
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,080
uh but he says uh he used to say that

510
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
story points set the agile industry back

511
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,799
10 years

512
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,640
and he was wrong they set the industry

513
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,640
back 20 years

514
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,679
we have been scrum has been around for

515
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,120
25 years the agile manifesto

516
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,679
was signed nearly 20 years ago and we're

517
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,799
still

518
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,159
talking about uh story points

519
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,960
and velocity as a concrete measure for

520
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,799
teams

521
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,000
and it is just not acceptable

522
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,039
anymore we need to create

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,919
uh a world in which we have a

524
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,480
more suitable set of measures that we

525
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,080
can

526
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,360
actually use to understand

527
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,640
our work understand how the team is go

528
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,960
doing and understand how changes that

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
that team makes or that the organization

530
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,159
makes

531
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,640
impacts on that work we need something

532
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,320
that when you game the system it

533
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,280
produces a different result

534
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,559
instead of gaming the system by oh we'll

535
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,480
just call that a

536
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,919
ten pointer instead of a five pointer

537
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,960
and we've doubled the amount of work

538
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
that we did

539
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,000
and we want people to be gaming the

540
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,760
system in a way

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,880
that benefits the process that reduces

542
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,919
uh the time it takes for us to deliver

543
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,400
things

544
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,360
and there are some very key practices

545
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
around that

546
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,400
uh they are well known i'm not going to

547
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,559
be

548
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,679
uh i'm not opening a a magic box

549
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,720
um but we need to be actively

550
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,360
managing items in progress

551
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,480
actively managing the items that we're

552
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
working on

553
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,799
and the way to do that is definitely to

554
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,840
visualize

555
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,520
your work um understand

556
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,120
where what stage things are at and if

557
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,320
you will have seen a kanban style board

558
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,200
before

559
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,919
where work itself moves across rather

560
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
than

561
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,000
a storyboard where the work

562
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,880
is stationary and items of work

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
flow across so the what is stationary on

564
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
this

565
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,960
uh board the what is flowing uh

566
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,320
across during the sprint and and we

567
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,360
maybe have some

568
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,480
at stages along the way that work has to

569
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
flow through

570
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
in order to get to at the end get to

571
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,039
production

572
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
uh but you can see a limiting uh working

573
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,000
process by having

574
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,080
a a total whip limit that's divided

575
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,679
into the individual columns kanban has

576
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,720
no requirement

577
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,080
to have uh individual columns with whip

578
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,880
limits however

579
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,240
if you are going to have columns within

580
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,360
that process then they should have what

581
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,799
plummets beetle you don't have to

582
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,840
but we need to also record our cycle

583
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,039
time we need to understand how

584
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,360
long things are in process for

585
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,520
how long does it take from when the the

586
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,799
team that owns that kanban

587
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,960
owns that part of the process when they

588
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,720
decide that work has started

589
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,720
until they decide that work has finished

590
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,240
uh we can use our work in process

591
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
and plot that uh on a on a graph called

592
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,799
a cumulative flow

593
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
graph and cumulative flow is very scary

594
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,919
to look at when you

595
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,159
first see it but it actually gives you

596
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,200
an

597
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,840
indication of the predictability

598
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,039
that you're having so you can see this

599
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,120
particular

600
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,320
cumulative flow that you see there which

601
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,360
is a little bit small but

602
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,600
can i zoom in

603
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:08,960
oh i think i can using there we go

604
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,520
uh this particular cumulative flow is

605
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,000
uh showing each of the different columns

606
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
that we had

607
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,240
and sorry was there a question

608
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,559
there's just some background noise it's

609
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,600
okay everybody's muted now that's

610
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,080
awesome so uh

611
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,760
that these lines on the cumulative flow

612
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,039
are wavy

613
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,640
i.e not straight is an indication of a

614
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,640
lack of predictability

615
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
the more predictability you have in the

616
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,279
system the

617
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,919
straighter those lines are and then

618
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,279
it's easy to see once those lines are a

619
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,240
little bit straighter

620
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,440
if they're diverging your working

621
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,159
process is increasing

622
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
if they're coming together then your

623
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,880
working process

624
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,520
is reducing ideally what you want to see

625
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
is parallel lines but that's almost

626
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,960
never going to

627
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,760
happen in the real world but that's the

628
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,279
the goal

629
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,159
that you're aiming for as you uh

630
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,240
do certain things in your process you

631
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,600
can see the impact that they have on

632
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,480
your predictability

633
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
this graph is indicative of the

634
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,279
predictability

635
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
of the team and that these lines are

636
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,200
waving around all over the place

637
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,679
is a indication that they're not being

638
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,520
very predictable

639
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:34,320
unzoom that there we go so working pro

640
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,360
cycle time and working process are two

641
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,960
really powerful

642
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,159
at measures throughput um is

643
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,880
a measure of items of work

644
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
per unit of time so you can use any unit

645
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
of time

646
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,720
you like if you're sprinting it's

647
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,760
probably

648
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,679
a two-week sprint so how many

649
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,559
pieces of work were you able to deliver

650
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,559
in two weeks and it does not care about

651
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,000
size it very deliberately doesn't care

652
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,799
about size which is the difference

653
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,039
between

654
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,880
throughput and velocity velocity usually

655
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,159
cares about the size or complexity of

656
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
items because you're applying story

657
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,559
points

658
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,520
throughput ignores that because then

659
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,440
gaming the system will be the team

660
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
reducing the size of the items by

661
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,760
breaking them down or making them

662
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
simpler

663
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,159
and and things that are smaller are

664
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,760
going to go through this process

665
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,640
a lot quicker because smaller things are

666
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,400
easier to do so if we half the size

667
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,400
of all of the things that we're working

668
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,039
on we're going to half the amount of

669
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,880
work

670
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,400
that we have to do therefore we will

671
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,080
half the amount of time

672
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,480
it takes to go through the system

673
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,840
therefore each item

674
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,440
will get delivered more quickly um

675
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,080
so that's it's i'm fine with the team

676
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,760
gaming that metric but throughput um

677
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,400
allows us to tell an interesting

678
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,720
uh story but there's one more metric

679
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,880
that we really need to understand

680
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,080
that helps us have more interesting

681
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,200
conversations

682
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,559
during our existing uh agile events

683
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
maybe you're doing scrum

684
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,080
maybe you're doing other uh processes

685
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,559
maybe you've made up your

686
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,320
own uh very powerful process empirical

687
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,039
process control system that works for

688
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,400
you

689
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,000
um and that is work item aging

690
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,840
we have to understand how old things are

691
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,880
and how close they are to our

692
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,200
uh uh likelihood of completing them

693
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,799
in order to see whether we need to go

694
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,960
deal with something now

695
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,559
is this getting so old it's been in

696
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,440
there so long

697
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,360
that it's likely not to me then me be

698
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
delivered by the end of the sprint

699
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,960
that may be something that we want to

700
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
focus on as a team that we maybe want to

701
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,679
swarm

702
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,000
around so it allows us to have some of

703
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,279
those more interesting conversations

704
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
so in order to use flow in a scrum

705
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
context

706
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
i i'm a professional scrum trainer my

707
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,320
recommendation

708
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,039
is uh to use scrum as your scaffolding

709
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,919
for

710
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,360
project management and then flow to flow

711
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,840
techniques to manage your work that

712
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,919
would be my general recommendation

713
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,039
but flow in a scrum process those core

714
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
practices

715
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,159
are that defining and visualizing your

716
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
work

717
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
limiting the working process we have to

718
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,760
measure it and then

719
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,200
actively managing those items and the

720
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,320
actively managing

721
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,840
is uh super important there you're not

722
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,440
actively managing if you're just

723
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
ignoring stuff and letting it flow

724
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,919
through the sprint you need to actually

725
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,200
go decide whether you need to do

726
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,240
something extra whether you need to

727
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,600
change what you're doing

728
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,720
inside of that process and inspecting

729
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,559
and adapting

730
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,480
your workflow you need to constantly

731
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,120
make changes to your workflow

732
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,399
see how it affects the data one of the

733
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,440
things that i mentioned which is the

734
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,559
most common

735
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,360
uh uh thing that we talk about in

736
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,320
any flow techniques is reducing batch

737
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,600
size

738
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,880
making batches smaller will help us

739
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,919
deliver things more quickly

740
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,120
so i would like to um

741
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,360
do another little exercise in

742
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,880
mural so i have let's

743
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,440
where did i put it in

744
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,760
the mural nope that's not what i wanted

745
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,760
to do it's a tab that's already there

746
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,640
there it is um in the mural there's a

747
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,320
third exercise in number three batches

748
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
in scrum

749
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
uh and three people are following me let

750
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
me just summon

751
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,840
everyone and then i'll not i'll not zoom

752
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,279
so i get nine people following me now

753
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,919
what i'd like you to do is create a

754
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,440
sticky for everything that you think is

755
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,320
a batch

756
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,679
in scrum what are what are batches in

757
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,279
this scrum world so i'm gonna i'm gonna

758
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,720
put two minutes on the time box your

759
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,159
smart group should be able to do this in

760
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,480
two minutes

761
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,799
um and we need to come up with a list of

762
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
those batches so think of things that

763
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,159
you would be counted by actually

764
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,200
deliverable definitely

765
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,640
uh a thing that is a batch

766
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,880
what what would you call that in the

767
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,480
scrum world

768
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
we can have that as an additional sticky

769
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,600
next to it oh the increment

770
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,399
okay yes definitely the increment is a

771
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,200
batch

772
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,320
thank you for for making that clearer i

773
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,360
was not 100

774
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
on that for those uh there are nine

775
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
people here

776
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,679
there are how many participants are

777
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,520
there

778
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,360
in the there are 12 participants

779
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,399
in the call in the chat you should be

780
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,440
able to see

781
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,919
a link for the

782
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,000
mural i'm gonna post it again i see uh

783
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,159
marty has also posted it again

784
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,840
because folks that are new in will not

785
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,039
see it but i will post it again so folks

786
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,919
can get in

787
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,799
thank you uh marty for that that's very

788
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,919
useful

789
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,200
as we get pbis in the sprint backlog

790
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,640
so are you saying that the sprint

791
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,200
backlog is a batch or that the pbis

792
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,080
are a batch or both maybe you need two

793
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,840
stickies

794
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,480
i would count them as two separate

795
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,360
things

796
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,120
does anybody else like would like to add

797
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,320
a few things to this list sprint backlog

798
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,000
yes thank you very much

799
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,360
visiting visiting dragon bracket the

800
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,480
sea lion awesome

801
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,480
is there any um

802
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,159
anybody else going to add something

803
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,159
there's 25 seconds left

804
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,840
retrospective commitments

805
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,480
perfect thank you visiting c-line i'm

806
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,399
going to add a couple as well

807
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,840
um i'm going to say pbis

808
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,000
product backlog items whether you call

809
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,279
them uh

810
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,519
stories or

811
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,320
our requirements whatever you call those

812
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,360
things

813
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,519
um so we've got uh the sprint backlog

814
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:05,200
pbis uh the increment uh

815
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,399
retro next actions these are all uh uh

816
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
batches in scrum and one of the things

817
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,159
that we

818
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:17,519
try and uh do once we start

819
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,399
looking at our flow techniques

820
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,360
is we start reducing the batch size for

821
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,559
as many things as possible

822
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,120
so we want to reduce the size of our

823
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,559
pbis the things from our product backlog

824
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,480
that we're taking through

825
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,200
on average um i see scrum teams taking

826
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,799
on

827
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,960
maybe 8 to 12 things per sprint

828
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,159
that's just a vague average from my

829
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,080
experience

830
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,559
um but teams that monitor flow

831
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,320
have that go up to 70 or 80 things

832
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,159
because they're making each of those

833
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,360
pieces of value

834
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,640
much smaller which means they flow much

835
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,679
more quickly

836
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,720
through the system and once you have a

837
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,039
flow based system you can start looking

838
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,559
at

839
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,039
how you can break down that batch

840
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,960
of the increment are you doing

841
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,440
continuous delivery

842
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,279
are you using devops practices to

843
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,000
continuously deliver your product to

844
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,320
production

845
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,679
and what engineering practices do you

846
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,720
use to make sure that you

847
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,039
always have a good product to be able to

848
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,080
ship

849
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,320
to production uh so once you have that

850
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,039
you can then start flowing work

851
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,880
across the sprint boundary because we

852
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,000
always have working software we're

853
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,480
always shipping

854
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,080
every commit to source control in a

855
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,360
continuous delivery world

856
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,760
ends up in production therefore

857
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,480
um we have the engineering practices in

858
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,880
place

859
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
to hide things that are not finished yet

860
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,240
maybe we're using feature flags

861
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,559
and still ship to production we can then

862
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,320
have a piece of work that well we didn't

863
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,919
quite finish it in this sprint but we're

864
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,399
going to finish it in the next print and

865
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,360
it just

866
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,039
flows right across the sprint boundary

867
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,240
then scrum becomes

868
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,200
that container for planning and

869
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,079
flow management techniques are used for

870
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,480
delivery

871
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,720
and that's very powerful we're using

872
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,079
flow in our production line

873
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,000
but we're using a two-week iterative

874
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,800
cycle for our cognitive uh ideation and

875
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,240
planning

876
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:33,200
cycle that's that's uh really powerful

877
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,000
so then at the individual events in

878
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,159
scrum we can

879
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,119
actually have different completely

880
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,480
different conversations

881
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,119
when we're at our our daily scrum

882
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,720
we're not necessarily focused on the

883
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,760
individual anymore

884
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,599
what did i do to to

885
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,679
what did i do yesterday what am i doing

886
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,599
today what am i

887
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,200
going to do tomorrow yeah anything

888
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,240
that's blocking me

889
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,599
we're looking at things on the board and

890
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,079
saying

891
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,359
why is this thing not moving why is it

892
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,040
here so long

893
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,800
oh this one's not been here that long

894
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,200
but this one's been here really long so

895
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,640
let's focus on this one instead

896
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,599
um what can we do to move this item

897
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,000
forward to get it closer to the end of

898
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,760
that

899
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,359
process and things like going right to

900
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,359
left on the board

901
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,119
help with that because you've got a pool

902
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,079
process you're not pushing work through

903
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
this process

904
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,160
it's being pulled from the right uh from

905
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,320
from the left to the right yeah

906
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,000
pooled uh i don't think i've got my

907
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,280
terminology quite right there but i

908
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,839
think you know what i mean and it allows

909
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
us to

910
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,200
to really have better conversations

911
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,640
about that work

912
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,720
and the thing that allows us to see uh

913
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,000
when things have been sitting too long

914
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,960
uh measuring

915
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,839
measuring latency what one easy way to

916
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,280
do it

917
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,040
it says they're right the date on the

918
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,079
back of the cards i've seen

919
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,440
dot voting uh so you just put every day

920
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,359
put a dot on the card and the cards with

921
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
the most dots that are still in progress

922
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,880
are the things you want to focus on

923
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,480
uh jessica really liked that idea

924
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,960
of sticking a a banana peel to the item

925
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,720
and the

926
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,839
browner the banana peel the longer it's

927
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
been sitting there you don't want it

928
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,400
sitting there

929
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,040
too long or it'll start to smell um

930
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,520
but one of the things that we often use

931
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,880
and the

932
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,000
graph that we use uh there is a is a

933
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,040
um histogram with whip limits

934
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,480
um and the green is uh you can see the

935
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
the 50 70 85 95 i'm going to talk about

936
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,560
competent

937
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,920
confidence levels in the next slide but

938
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,520
that's effectively

939
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,560
uh green is things are flowing awesome

940
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,079
at half of the things that we do end up

941
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,200
in that green bit

942
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,040
uh 70 of the things we do end up

943
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,320
in the light green 85 percent end up

944
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,800
in the yellow and 95 of things

945
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,000
are done within the orange so if

946
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,560
something's in the

947
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,320
red it is likely that it will not

948
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,160
be finished by the end of the sprint if

949
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,960
something's in the orange

950
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
it's could be a con it's a definitely a

951
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,079
concern

952
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,359
if something's in the yellow it's going

953
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,520
to be a concern

954
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,359
so you can see that progression and this

955
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,720
particular graph they're calculating it

956
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,720
per column

957
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,240
you can do it just overall which is what

958
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,640
i'm going to show you

959
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,520
next so we use the cycle times

960
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,440
scatter plot so we plot all of those

961
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,880
cycle times that we calculate how long

962
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,480
things are going to take

963
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,680
uh on the vertical axis here

964
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,400
uh so that is number of days so you can

965
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,440
see

966
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,040
uh seven days 10 days 12 days

967
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,359
at 16 days all the way up to 30 days

968
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,240
to deliver something and then along the

969
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,560
bottom is the

970
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,640
the date that it was finished and you

971
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,599
can see that some of the items have uh

972
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,040
uh maybe you can

973
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,200
maybe need to zoom in for that have a

974
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,240
four in them how many items

975
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,960
uh uh were in that four oh sorry four

976
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,440
items were

977
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,160
were in that particular point in time

978
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,960
the horizontal dotted lines with the 50

979
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,240
75 85 and 95

980
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,640
are um calculated

981
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,640
that 50 of all the items

982
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,000
displayed on this graph are below that

983
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,920
50 line

984
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,400
75 percent of all the items are below

985
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,440
the 78 line 85

986
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,480
same as you go up and the prediction on

987
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,160
the left

988
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,880
is the seven days 50 of all the things

989
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,640
we do based on this data will be

990
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,200
delivered in seven days

991
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,480
but if you go all the way up to 85 it's

992
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,040
16 days

993
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,880
so we can say for sure for this

994
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,520
particular team

995
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,000
that 85 of the time

996
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,920
anything we bring into their sprint is

997
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,400
finished in 16 days or less

998
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,400
anything

999
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,400
that's a really powerful measure that's

1000
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,839
a concrete

1001
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,119
statistical measure there is some leeway

1002
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,240
there there is some space for

1003
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,520
for concern but 85 is pretty

1004
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,960
pretty sure remember we're

1005
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,560
working on creative work so more is

1006
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,480
unknown than known so if we get a

1007
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,040
a 16 day uh

1008
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,720
85 percent then that's pretty good but i

1009
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,880
would ask a question

1010
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,800
i would ask if we're on a two-week

1011
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,040
sprint is 16 days

1012
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,240
okay and in fact it's not it's too slow

1013
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,800
so we can use those flow metrics in

1014
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,079
different

1015
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,560
events within our uh

1016
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,760
scrum in order to understand them a

1017
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,640
little bit better

1018
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,800
so we can use work item aging in our

1019
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
daily scrum to understand where we need

1020
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,760
to focus our time

1021
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,040
uh we can use cycle time in our retro

1022
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,800
retrospective to understand

1023
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:20,000
uh how things went during the sprint

1024
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
are we able to increase our

1025
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,200
confidence level that we're giving to

1026
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
our stakeholders

1027
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,720
what does that confidence level look

1028
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,359
like what can we do to improve it we can

1029
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,440
look at that

1030
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,400
that data there the cycle time

1031
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
we can use our work in process during

1032
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,040
the daily scrum

1033
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,760
to understand uh how things are

1034
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,200
are flowing again part of that uh aging

1035
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,079
data as well

1036
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,760
but also during our retro are are what

1037
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,520
do our whip limits make sense

1038
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,960
uh is work flowing well through the

1039
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,800
system do we need to do

1040
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,160
something about it and potentially at

1041
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
the review as well

1042
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,560
talking to our stakeholders get more

1043
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,040
credibility with your stakeholders

1044
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,960
and you can also use throughput during

1045
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,160
sprint planning our throughput

1046
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,359
is a concrete indication of

1047
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,000
what's happened in the past so we're

1048
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,720
able to

1049
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,319
use that to understand what we might

1050
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,200
potentially be able to do

1051
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:21,040
in the future it's a lot more it has a

1052
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,880
much higher degree of accuracy

1053
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,359
than velocity because

1054
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,880
we will have been able over a period of

1055
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,760
time to improve our predictability

1056
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,960
which is not possible using velocity and

1057
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,880
story points

1058
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,319
so we would use throughput during our

1059
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,680
planning our review

1060
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,880
and our our retro so this

1061
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,319
data will help us understand

1062
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,760
those things help us manage that work

1063
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,280
help us have uh build trust with our

1064
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,560
stakeholders

1065
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,920
by making uh uh

1066
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,400
that story of data and when things will

1067
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,720
be done

1068
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,079
a lot more at credible uh

1069
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,240
as a good quote you can definitely

1070
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,680
have a read of that later it's long but

1071
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,680
it's basically

1072
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,119
half your batch size things will get

1073
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,800
delivered faster

1074
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,720
um half and again things will get

1075
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,680
delivered faster again

1076
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,160
if you want to research at some stuff on

1077
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,359
this

1078
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,160
topic uh i've put some notes up there at

1079
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,240
little's law

1080
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,280
queuing theory continuous delivery no

1081
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,400
estimates

1082
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,640
and there is a guide from scrum.org that

1083
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,560
is an addendum to the scrum guide called

1084
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,000
the kanban guide for scrum teams

1085
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,880
about how you implement flow techniques

1086
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,599
within the empirical control system

1087
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,040
which is

1088
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:51,119
scrum and that can be very powerful

1089
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,359
so in the minute i have left

1090
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,480
i would like to open up for both

1091
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,200
questions

1092
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:02,000
and feedback um if you want you can

1093
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,880
unmute to ask questions i would also

1094
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,079
love

1095
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,800
uh for you to put feedback in

1096
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,520
the mural things in this talk you were

1097
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,480
happy with

1098
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,920
things uh you thought were meh and

1099
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,280
things that you didn't like

1100
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,760
as well as um anything that you think i

1101
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:25,599
can do to improve the talk

1102
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,839
um also questions does anybody have any

1103
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,839
questions

1104
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:53,680
yeah hi martin uh here are

1105
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,000
the the draw on speaking the drum guest

1106
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,400
what about what do you think about

1107
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,560
putting some metrics related more than

1108
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,240
you're talking about incomes about

1109
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,640
throughput but

1110
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,960
what do you recommend to a team that

1111
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,680
want to begin to focus on outcome or an

1112
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,160
output

1113
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,599
more than more than only predictability

1114
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,079
about

1115
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,079
uh if what they are really really

1116
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,560
what they are uh producing what is the

1117
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,440
real impact to the customer

1118
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,200
or so yeah and i think that that's yeah

1119
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,079
that that's an awesome question

1120
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,599
um so just to to paraphrase that so that

1121
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,640
i make sure i've got it right

1122
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,000
and the these metrics are awesome

1123
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,920
for uh monitoring delivery and improving

1124
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,119
delivery but that doesn't we could still

1125
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,760
be delivering a

1126
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,319
pile of crap to our customers um how do

1127
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,040
we

1128
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,240
monitor value that we're delivering to

1129
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,560
our customers

1130
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,560
is that

1131
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,200
your questions yeah yeah is it yeah just

1132
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,960
stopping the delivering crap yeah

1133
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,040
yeah something that doesn't deliver crap

1134
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,920
deliver more value um

1135
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,839
yeah that that's your measure no um so

1136
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,119
uh

1137
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,119
i talk about i i have i teach class uh

1138
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,520
called the the professional scrum with

1139
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,240
ux user experience

1140
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,720
and what it really is is how to uh how

1141
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,200
to

1142
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,560
what data do we use to optimize value

1143
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,119
and there's no concrete measures for

1144
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,960
that

1145
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,480
i could i would actually point you a

1146
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,079
little bit at the

1147
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,240
um ebm evidence-based management guide

1148
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,280
from scrum.org they have a bunch of

1149
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,599
starter measures that are very generic

1150
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,119
uh that are good for measuring change

1151
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,560
within your organization and are you

1152
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,240
improving and are you having happy

1153
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,720
customers because happy customers

1154
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,520
happy customers happy employees always

1155
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,880
good

1156
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,280
um but also for

1157
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,960
every single idea that your product

1158
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,480
owner has

1159
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,520
and they need to along with the scrum

1160
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,599
team

1161
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,839
understand what they're trying to

1162
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,520
achieve with it what behavior

1163
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,839
in your customers are you trying to

1164
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,599
change what are you trying to improve

1165
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,440
how are you going to measure that so

1166
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,760
it's specific to each

1167
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,960
backlog item it's part of that what that

1168
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,640
you're delivering

1169
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,960
so how you're going to measure that and

1170
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,000
then actually measure it

1171
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,480
so telemetry is your friend there

1172
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,599
are people actually using the feature

1173
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,200
that you built

1174
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,599
and are they using it in the way you

1175
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,200
expect is it creating that changing

1176
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,880
behavior for the users

1177
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,040
that you expect so you have to be able

1178
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,400
to model the existing behavior and then

1179
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,040
see the change

1180
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,160
i i usually use app insights application

1181
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,520
insights

1182
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,319
uh for that works on any any tech any

1183
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,800
platform

1184
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,440
and it allows you to not only collect

1185
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,200
the base

1186
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,040
data you know like some of the google

1187
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,839
analytics stuff plus the server-side

1188
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,280
stuff

1189
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:54,240
um but also add your own

1190
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,680
custom metrics that are about how your

1191
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
application functions how that

1192
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,240
particular feature works

1193
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,040
and and and monitor that data is your

1194
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,440
friend

1195
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,440
honestly data's your friend customers

1196
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,359
lie

1197
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,720
remember that customers lie data

1198
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,160
generally doesn't although

1199
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,200
you can read it badly um so definitely

1200
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,800
good

1201
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,880
thank you for that question did i answer

1202
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,880
it

1203
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,079

00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,960
yeah thank you martin agree with the

1205
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,160
lies of

1206
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:32,160
our customers or yes

1207
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,839
what was it uh henry ford said if uh

1208
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,000
if if he'd listened to customers he

1209
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:41,440
would have created faster horses

1210
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,240
rather than the motor car um

1211
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
any other questions

1212
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,720

1213
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,040
