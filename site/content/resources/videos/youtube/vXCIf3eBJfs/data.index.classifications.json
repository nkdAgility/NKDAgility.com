Stronger audience overlap results from its targeting of technical/managerial readers, and a high signal-to-noise ratio reflects the focus of the article.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content discusses selecting Agile coaches who are adaptable and agnostic, aligning somewhat with agency and continuous improvement. However, it does not address the deliberate design of engineering practices, decision decentralization, or human/AI agency central to Agentic Engineering. Overall, relevance is peripheral.",

    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses selecting an Agile coach with adaptability and framework-agnostic expertise. Agentic Software Delivery is not directly mentioned nor implied. There's no discussion of AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent synergy, or autonomous agentic practices. The main topics are about human coaching, adaptability across Agile methods, and practical coaching qualities—completely outside the key concepts of agentic delivery. The audience is process-improvement focused (Agile leaders, delivery teams), which slightly overlaps with the category's likely audience, but only marginally. The majority of the content is focused on coaching, not on technical, agentic, or AI-enabled delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is about choosing adaptable Agile coaches, not about agentic software delivery. No discussion of autonomous agents, AI integration, or agentic principles. Fit is minimal; alignment is very weak and indirect at best.",
