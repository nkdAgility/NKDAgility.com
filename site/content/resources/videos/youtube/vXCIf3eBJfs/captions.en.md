When you're considering an agile coach, a really important thing to look at is whether they're agnostic. Do they, are they a one trick pony? Right? Do they only do Scrum? Do they only do Kanban? Do they only do whatever it is that they only do? Or are they able to have conversations around what is the best practice, tool, or technology that will emerge that's right for your business, regardless of what flavour it is?
