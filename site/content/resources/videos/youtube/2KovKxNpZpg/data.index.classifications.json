It highlights system-level convictions, demonstrates the consequences of lacking ethos (reduced engagement, misplaced priorities), emphasizes genuine system behavior, and recommends action based on ethos rather than procedures. While it doesn't repeatedly use the term 'ethos', the alignment and depth strongly demonstrate an exploration of underlying convictions. The narrative targets practitioners and leaders, discussing not just what is done but why, matching the category scope.
