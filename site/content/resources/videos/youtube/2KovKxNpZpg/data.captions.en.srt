1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:08,280
so something that really annoys me in

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,800
scrum is this focus on the mechanics of

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,799
scrum and less focus on the principles

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,379
of scrum so people and organizations

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,020
that will tell you that you're not doing

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,260
scrum if you're not standing up

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,180
um it's just ridiculous it's not even a

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,699
conversation we should be having we

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,760
should be focusing on the principles

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:32,480
empiricism transparency and just getting

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,480
stuff done
