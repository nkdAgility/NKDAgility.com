1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,200
one of the core practices of caman is to

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:10,440
Define and visualize your workflow this

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,200
is really important because it sets the

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,320
groundwork for us all all the people

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,359
that are participating in the work in

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,840
the system as all

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,720
agreeing what is it that we do and how

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,519
do we currently work so there are lots

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,720
of pieces of information that we need to

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,039
pull together uh to figure figure this

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,160
out so one might be like what goes on

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,399
our board that might be a great question

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,360
to ask what types of work goes on our

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,680
board um another question might be what

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
are what are the current what are the

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,199
stages that all of our work goes through

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
not a specific piece of work but all of

18
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:51,640
our work goes through that would

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,920
generate the columns within your your

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,480
cambam board but also asking additional

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,399
questions like why do we pick this item

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,000
how do we pick the item from this column

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,479
when we go to select things and what

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,280
you'll find is that for most teams most

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:16,400
groups of people they don't have any

26
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,080
level of agreement on what that is why

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,600
would you pick something lots of lots of

28
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,400
people will pick stuff because they

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,799
think it's cool because it fits they

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,560
think it fits their skill set but the

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,000
important questions to be asking are how

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,240
do we pick this so we maximize the value

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
value of what we're delivering is that

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,600
the right thing to select in order to do

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,920
that is that the right business decision

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,079
and answering those questions and coming

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,799
up with a set of rules for our team

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,640
right these are our decided rules on how

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,759
we're going to select things why things

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,600
move uh from one column to another what

41
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,840
are the defined States what are the

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,439
types of work um and how are we going

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,439
to control the amount of work that we

44
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:08,039
have in progress are all part of

45
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,440
defining our

46
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,840
workflow and

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,760
explicitly setting policies that's all

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
part of this defining and visualizing

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,920
your workflow

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,959
and bringing all of those things

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,400
together allow us to have a way of

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,519
working right it another way of saying

53
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,680
this another way of saying Define inv

54
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,800
vision ize your workflow is what is your

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
team's way of working and does everybody

56
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,440
on your team agree that that's the way

57
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,280
that they should be working

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:47,959
um this definition is absolutely

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,239
fundamental to figuring out um how work

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,920
flows through your system right you'll

61
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,200
probably have heard folks talk about

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,239
having a stable system right you need a

63
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,360
stable system well you can't have a

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,239
stable system if every member of the

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,599
team decides ad hoc how they're going to

66
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,280
do all of the things within the system

67
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,000
we don't have a system we've got to make

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,760
it up as you go along system and that's

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,840
never going to generate stability so

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,040
having a stable system means we've

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,319
decided what it is we've written down

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,760
how we're going to work we've debated as

73
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:28,720
a team and decided on certain things and

74
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,000
then we visualize that so we can all see

75
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,959
what's going on if you are struggling to

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,239
implement a cband strategy we can help

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,519
or we can help you find somebody who can
