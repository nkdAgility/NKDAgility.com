One of the core practices of [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) that I’ve come to appreciate deeply is the importance of defining and visualising our workflow. This practice is not just a procedural step; it lays the groundwork for everyone involved in the work system to agree on what we do and how we currently operate. 

### Why Define and Visualise Your Workflow?

When we take the time to define our workflow, we create a shared understanding among team members. This is crucial for several reasons:

- **Clarity**: Everyone knows what to expect and how to contribute.
- **Alignment**: Team members are on the same page regarding priorities and processes.
- **Efficiency**: A well-defined workflow reduces confusion and streamlines operations.

### Key Questions to Consider

To effectively define our workflow, we need to gather various pieces of information. Here are some essential questions to ask:

- **What goes on our board?**  
  Identifying the types of work that will be represented is fundamental. This could include tasks, projects, or any other relevant work items.

- **What are the current stages of our work?**  
  It’s not just about individual tasks; we need to consider the overall flow of all work through the system. This will help us establish the columns on our Kanban board.

- **How do we select items from the board?**  
  This is where things can get tricky. Often, team members choose tasks based on personal preference or perceived fit with their skills. However, we must ask ourselves:  
  - Are we maximising the value of what we deliver?  
  - Are we making the right business decisions?

### Establishing Rules and Policies

Once we’ve answered these questions, it’s time to set some ground rules. This includes:

- **Defining how we select tasks**: Establish clear criteria for choosing work items.
- **Determining how work moves between columns**: What does it mean for a task to progress from one stage to another?
- **Identifying the types of work**: What categories do we need to include on our board?
- **Controlling work in progress (WIP)**: How do we manage the amount of work we take on at any given time?

These rules are not just arbitrary; they are essential for creating a stable system. Without them, we risk devolving into a chaotic environment where each team member operates on their own terms, leading to instability and inefficiency.

### The Importance of a Stable System

You may have heard the term "stable system" thrown around in discussions about Kanban. But what does it really mean? A stable system is one where:

- **Everyone agrees on the process**: There’s a collective understanding of how work should flow.
- **Processes are documented**: We’ve written down our agreed-upon methods, making it easier to onboard new team members and maintain consistency.
- **Visualisation is key**: By visualising our workflow, we can all see what’s happening at a glance, which fosters [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) and accountability.

### Conclusion

Defining and visualising your workflow is not just a best practice; it’s a fundamental aspect of effective Kanban implementation. If you’re struggling to put this into practice, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. Whether it’s through my services or connecting you with someone who can assist, there’s always a way to enhance your Kanban strategy.

By taking these steps, you’ll not only improve your team’s efficiency but also create a more harmonious working environment where everyone knows their role and how they contribute to the bigger picture. Let’s embrace the power of a well-defined workflow and watch our productivity soar!
