1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:08,000
governance is important for

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,840
organizations to function safely too

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,559
many organizations if if you've got

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,040
extremely high levels of governance

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,359
within your organization you're probably

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,600
have going going to have a great deal of

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,960
difficulty taking advantage of

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,320
opportunities and dealing with surprises

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,480
right a surprise something that goes

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
wrong in the market or your organization

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,880
or your product or whatever it is is

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,680
going to take a long time and be much

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,239
more expensive to fix than it needs to

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,680
be um now that doesn't mean that you

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,920
can't do something because most

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,000
government governance is

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,480
self-imposed I'm going to explain that

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,920
because um it's something that I've seen

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,840
time and time again so in in most

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,079
organizations um especially if you're

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,199
siloed so if you have a governance

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,879
Department right this is even more true

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,760
um just like if you have Security

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,640
Department you've weird security

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:09,479
decisions there's uh this idea of local

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,360
optim optimization rather than system

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,280
optimization okay so sometimes when you

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,280
look at just one thing and you make a

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,079
change or make a fix for that one thing

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,960
you're actually making a change that's

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,200
better for this one thing but it breaks

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,799
something overall in the organization

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,119
right so I I I really say

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,320
example is let's say you have a a cog in

35
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,399
a

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,600
machine and you're looking just at this

37
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,200
Cog and it's slow to turn because it's

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,280
pushing against all these other cogs in

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,399
the system um what would make this the

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,759
most efficient Cog possible well if we

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,280
delete all the teeth from the Cog then

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
it can just spin

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,399
freely but now it no longer drives the

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
rest of the system it's no longer part

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,600
of the rest the system right we've made

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,320
a local optimization that that makes

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,520
this better but it doesn't doesn't help

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,040
us overall and that that's what often

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,519
happens when governance is a separate

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,160
department when governance is a a group

51
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,640
of people in an I'm going to say Ivory

52
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Tower because the architecture one is is

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,800
very close to that but in an ivory Tower

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,920
and they're making decisions about

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,280
governance for the sake of governance

56
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,160
they're not making decisions about

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,959
governance to provide value Safety and

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,200
Security to the organization they're

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,480
doing it for the sake of governance and

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,360
what you find often happens is they take

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,480
the externally imposed regulatory

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,200
governance that you might be required to

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,959
meet right there might be government

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,400
regulations there might be industry

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,239
regulations there could be Hippa there

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,680
could be FDA there could be whatever the

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,319
things FAA whatever regulations you come

68
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,800
under socks audit right being one socks

69
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,120
audit is a great example

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,400
um and they don't what you're supposed

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,120
to do to meet a socks audit is you're

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,360
supposed to do the absolute minimum that

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,239
it says in order to meet a socks audit

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,680
so for example you have to be able to

75
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:24,920
trace uh who did what in the

76
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,640
system but it doesn't have to be easy to

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,280
trace who does what it just has to be

78
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:34,040
traced so writing a log file

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,920
for example is is

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,599
adequate if you have to go look it up

81
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,360
because you're being audited or because

82
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,280
something's gone wrong you can you can

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,680
look it up right it might cost you a

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,760
little bit more for that one time but

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,400
overall it costs you a lot less because

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640
you don't have to build any systems

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,120
around maintaining the audit logs being

88
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,959
able to query the audit logs all of that

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,120
stuff is time and expense you don't need

90
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,159
so socks audit the people who created

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,760
the socks audit expect you to do the

92
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,799
absolute minimum you need to meet that

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,159
minimum bar which is the socks audit but

94
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,040
that's not what happens in organizations

95
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,519
what happens is over zelous and maybe

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm bringing in a little bit of bias

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,479
there but overzealous compliance

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,680
folks think about well if this is the

99
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,000
minimum bar then we should be here right

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,240
we should be much higher than than the

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
minimum bar to protect ourselves but

102
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,320
that's not true you only need to meet

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,600
the minimum bar to protect yourselves

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,800
that's it you've met the compliance

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,280
right and that means that there's lots

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,759
of things that you do in organizations

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,440
that don't have to be there or don't

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,600
have to be like that fantastic example

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,120
is I worked with an organization I try

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,880
to remember where it was somewhere

111
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,080
somewhere in the US and and they had a

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,280
huge a big compliance need um so much so

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,400
that every meeting that we had the the

114
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,000
notes all get sent off to compliance and

115
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
then feedback came back and that kind of

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,280
thing so we were talking about my level

117
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,400
five we were talking about all those

118
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,840
things and the compliance folks uh were

119
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,039
getting a bit ansy because we were

120
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,880
moving from their old system to team

121
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,960
Foundation server and they wanted to

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:31,080
have change request uh logs they wanted

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,440
to have all of those things so I

124
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,600
invited compliant to the event where I

125
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,360
was talking about how the system worked

126
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,400
and in as your devops it

127
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,639
maintains um every value of every

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,479
variable that ever was on on a work item

129
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,160
every field the full history of that

130
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,800
field is maintained it's never lost um

131
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,560
it's never overwritten it's never it's

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,440
just it's always available and I talked

133
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,039
about that and the team was saying yeah

134
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
but we have to have this change request

135
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
work item the compliance person was at

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,400
the back of the room sitting working

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,400
away just listening and I just asked

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,759
them directly it is this good enough to

139
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
meet the compliance and they were like

140
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,880
yeah no problem that's

141
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,800
great that works so we just

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,400
removed the whole need for change

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,000
request work items for they had other

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,120
documents and assets that were around

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,840
that story of change requests that we

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,720
know longer

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
needed because we met the compliance

148
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,840
without

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,039
them and this company had been doing

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,880
them for for years so there's all sorts

151
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,319
of organizational crft that builds up up

152
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,199
so you want to think about lean

153
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,440
governance lean governance lean

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,479
procurement lean processes is there any

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,240
waste in the system you want to think

156
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,280
about organizational hygiene right what

157
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,520
do you need to do on IR regular Cadence

158
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,400
to minimize cuz some sometimes you know

159
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,440
we create we think something looks a bit

160
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,080
scary so we create a policy for it um

161
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
and then it's not actually that scary

162
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,759
but the policy still exists and then

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,560
another policy gets bolted on and

164
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,680
another policy gets bolted on so we need

165
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,919
to go through of organizational hygiene

166
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,000
where we divest ourselves of waste right

167
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,120
of the things that don't work for us of

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,440
anything that is getting in our way that

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,039
doesn't add value to the overall system

170
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,280
so that's that's that's that's one thing

171
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,840
for sure um we want to have as much um

172
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,240
compliance as code as possible so if you

173
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,479
can um have it built into your product

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,720
that it just complies um this is for for

175
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,360
times where you do need to have you know

176
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,840
just write that log um and meet that

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:00,680
compliance then then then have it in

178
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:04,879
there so these types of

179
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:07,599
governance should be met in the absolute

180
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,879
minimum required minimum amount of work

181
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479
minimum amount of effort minimum amount

182
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:15,680
of code minimum amount of everything

183
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,199
required to meet the compliance and no

184
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,199
more
