 Lean Governance: How to Reduce Bureaucracy and Improve Agility Without Sacrificing Compliance

Governance is essential for organizations to function safely, but *too much governance* can slow teams down, making it harder to *respond to market opportunities and challenges*. In this video, I break down *how governance can either enable or stifle agility* and what organizations can do to *implement lean, effective governance* without unnecessary overhead.  

ðŸ“š *Chapters:*  
1. *00:00 Introduction* â€“ The balance between governance and agility.  
2. *02:30 The Problem with Over-Engineering Compliance* â€“ Why organizations create unnecessary bureaucracy.  
3. *06:15 Local vs. System Optimization* â€“ Why governance decisions often harm overall efficiency.  
4. *09:45 The Real Role of Compliance Teams* â€“ How overzealous governance makes things harder than they need to be.  
5. *13:30 The Hidden Cost of Over-Governance* â€“ How unnecessary policies add friction and delay innovation.  
6. *17:00 The Case for Lean Governance* â€“ How to meet compliance without excessive effort.  
7. *21:00 Compliance as Code* â€“ Automating governance to minimize manual processes.  
8. *25:30 Organizational Hygiene* â€“ The need for regular policy and governance reviews.  
9. *30:00 Call to Action* â€“ How Naked Agility can help your organization streamline governance.  

ðŸŽ¯ *Who This Video is For:*  
- *Executives & Senior Leaders*: Looking to balance governance with agility.  
- *CTOs & Compliance Officers*: Wanting to implement governance that enables, rather than hinders, delivery.  
- *Engineering & Delivery Teams*: Seeking ways to *reduce unnecessary process overhead* while staying compliant.  
- *Organizations with Heavy Regulatory Requirements*: Finding ways to *simplify compliance* without introducing risk.  

ðŸŒŸ *What Youâ€™ll Learn:*  
- Why *most governance is self-imposed* and often overcomplicated.  
- How *compliance teams create unnecessary policies* out of fear rather than necessity.  
- Why *meeting the minimum compliance standard is often enough*â€”and how to push back on unnecessary requirements.  
- The importance of *lean governance* and *eliminating organizational waste*.  
- How *compliance as code* can help automate and simplify governance.  
- Why organizations need *regular governance reviews* to remove outdated and unnecessary policies.  

ðŸ’¡ *Key Takeaways:*  
- *Governance Should Enable, Not Block Progress* â€“ Too much governance slows organizations down and increases costs.  
- *Most Compliance is Self-Imposed* â€“ Many policies exist *not* because theyâ€™re required, but because of overzealous risk aversion.  
- *Local Optimization Hurts the Whole System* â€“ A rule that helps one department can slow down the entire company.  
- *Meet the Minimum Compliance Requirement, No More* â€“ Most regulations require *only the bare minimum to be compliant*â€”donâ€™t do extra work.  
- *Automate Compliance Wherever Possible* â€“ Reduce manual oversight and policy enforcement by baking compliance into your systems.  
- *Organizational Hygiene Matters* â€“ Policies should be **reviewed and removed regularly** to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy from creeping in.
