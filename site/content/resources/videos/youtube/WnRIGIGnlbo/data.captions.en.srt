00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,080
not every shiny object deserves your

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,160
attention or your budget but that's not

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,719
how it feels when the next big thing is

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,200
lighting up in your inbox everybody's

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,519
talking about it your team wants to try

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,160
it a competitor just shipped something

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,480
with it and suddenly it's your job to

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,279
decide if it's a risk not to adopt

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,400
it but here's the truth chasing hype

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,400
without rigor drains more than time it

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,800
burns your team's energy it clutters

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,760
your architecture and it kills trust

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,559
when the new shiny thing doesn't pan out

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440

leadership isn't about jumping on trends

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,720
it's about knowing why you're saying yes

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,880
you stop reacting and start leading
