1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,880
so the question is why is uh Joanna a

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,980
great teacher for the professional agile

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,340
leadership class and I think

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,880
there's there's two aspects that I think

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,539
uh really make it perfect for her uh one

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,160
is her her absolute enthusiasm for the

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,539
for the class

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,840
um I've heard her say a number of times

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,579
that this is her favorite class to teach

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,620
right and that sort of thing really

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,880
comes across when you're when you're

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,160
engaging with people because the

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,660
questions are just so interesting I love

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,579
this class as well the questions are

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,899
just so interesting the answers are

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,960
really interesting the type of people

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,840
that come to the agile leadership class

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,899
if especially for for Joanna and I as

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,180
also Consultants right it's the type of

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,180
people that we're trying to talk to all

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,100
the time inside of organizations

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,320
um and because that leads to the second

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,400
reason she's so awesome

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,680
um because she's got a a a swathe of

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,960
experience and engaging with

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,659
organizations

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,200
um at various levels trying to help them

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,960
understand agile practices add your lean

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,020
all the all the flavors right

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,240
um she's she's very experienced in

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,479
having those conversations with

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
leadership with managers with people who

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,400
are who are playing at that level

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,740
um and and those conversations are just

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,140
so much fun because convincing somebody

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,259
in a leadership position

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,880
um to move towards agility or the they

38
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,079
get more value by pushing responsibility

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,720
down

40
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,780
convincing one of those people helps

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,579
lots of people and that's I think where

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,040
where she gets a lot of her passion from

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,439
