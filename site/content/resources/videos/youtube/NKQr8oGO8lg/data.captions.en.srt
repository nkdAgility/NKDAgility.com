1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,360
so

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,320
um starting from the perspective of the

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,460
company that is uh the sending their

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,760
their employees for a course so

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:25,380
immersive class brings not only learning

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,019
but also coaching and supporting in

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,160
applying the knowledge so from company

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,640
point of view they will not just have uh

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,040
prepared for certification experts or

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,059
people with just theoretical knowledge

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,000
we will help their people to really

12
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,879
apply a lot of the things that we cover

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,640
during the course so I would say that

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,000
from value point of view this is a great

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,600
offering for the company because we

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,840
promise we will do our best to help your

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,899
people apply and make positive changes

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,680
in your organization thanks to this

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,200
class what is even more interesting

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,920
every single module will bring

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,860
opportunity to deliver value so it's for

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,860
instance seven times when the potential

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,659
value will be delivered for for the

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,759
organization and and this is just the

25
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,259
beginning right it's a longer it's a

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,580
longer Journey

27
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,680
and so about the second situation second

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:37,939
perspective so we have someone that

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,420
wants to become a better expert

30
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:45,479
this class can actually help you nail

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,720
your uh your interview your job

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,780
interview because again you will no

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,619
longer be left with Theory with some

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,700
fancy tools Concepts and ideas you will

35
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,680
have practical how-to knowledge that you

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,720

37

ready to answer challenging questions

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,720
and what I believe is in the end of the

39
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,020
day the most important thing you will

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,140
