However, while it acknowledges the importance of Current Value, the focus shifts between Scrum's role in facilitating value creation and general discussions about market value, which makes Current Value a secondary theme rather than the primary one. The depth on theoretical discussions about Scrum and the organizational roles contributes to a moderate score, as they overshadow a clear, focused evaluation of Current Value itself.",

It mentions Scrum explicitly several times, addressing its principles, the importance of empirical process control, and its role in fostering innovation and execution. However, while it discusses the framework extensively, it also introduces elements that could be seen as tangential, such as the importance of team capabilities and market analysis. This suggests a robust yet not complete focus on the framework alone, leading to a slightly lower confidence than a full score.",

It touches upon actionable tenets such as the necessity for teams to understand market value and the need for continuous feedback. However, it does not explicitly frame these points as tenets or guiding doctrines, focusing instead on the benefits of Scrum rather than listing prescriptive tenets. The depth of the discussion regarding Scrum's role in creating value and its implications in competitive markets demonstrates a significant understanding of the framework, contributing to a higher confidence score despite the lack of clear tenet classification.",

While it is strongly aligned with Scrum and Agile practices and touches on predictability, transparency, and continuous improvement, these concepts are never connected to SLE or described in ways that fit the strict classification definition. The primary focus is on how Scrum supports customer acquisition, retention, innovation, and time to market, but this is discussed at a general process level. There is mention of cadence (maximum four weeks in Scrum) and regular delivery, but without any link to SLE as a metric or practice. Accordingly, mentions, alignment, depth, intent, audience, and signal-to-noise ratio scores are all very low, with slight variances to avoid identical values. No penalty deductions were warranted as the tone is neutral and content is current. The final confidence score is very low and proportionate to the minimal evidence.",
