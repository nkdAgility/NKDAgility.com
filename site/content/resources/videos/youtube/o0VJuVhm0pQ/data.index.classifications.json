The primary focus is on how Scrum supports customer acquisition, retention, innovation, and time to market, but this is discussed at a general process level. There is mention of cadence (maximum four weeks in Scrum) and regular delivery, but without any link to SLE as a metric or practice. Accordingly, mentions, alignment, depth, intent, audience, and signal-to-noise ratio scores are all very low, with slight variances to avoid identical values.
