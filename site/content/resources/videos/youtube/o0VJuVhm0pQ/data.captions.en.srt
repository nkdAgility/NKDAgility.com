1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,640
foreign

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:16,440
so the question is in a highly

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,600
competitive market how to scrum product

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,740
development help acquire and retain

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,260
customers

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,439
I think there's two parts to that one

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,640
part is it doesn't right

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
um the the the the

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,620
you it's the value question again right

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,140
this this there's kind of two parts to

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,040
the puzzle there's there's

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,940
um market value right and Market values

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,500
made up of current value I.E what's the

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,379
value that's in your product right now

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,039
so you might measure things like I don't

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,059
know

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,520
um you might measure customer

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,140
satisfaction employee satisfaction and

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,000
usage of the features in your product

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,800
hopefully you get hopefully you've got

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,360
lots of telemetry coming off your

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,340
product to know what buttons people are

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,320
clicking when and why and at what time

24
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,240
of the month so that you can gather that

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,159
data and make decisions right that's

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
current value

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,220
um but also looking at

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,080
um

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,159
um

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,020
unrealized value

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,220
right for those that recognize it I'm

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,979
talking about evidence-based management

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,659
here but unrealized value is looking

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,119
forward in the future and figuring out

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,799
what what value you don't have in your

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,880
product yet that you need to have in

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,619
your product

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,840
so you could be looking at satisfaction

39
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,119
gaps hopefully you're not just doing

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,280
competitor analysis right but sometimes

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,659
you might do a competitor analysis and

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,220
figure out

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,700
um what you need to have on your product

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,640
backlog those those

45
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,460
two things scrum can't help you with

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,320
right you you need you need to be able

47
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,360
to it's going to create an environment

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,880
hopefully within which you realize you

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,619
need to do that and that

50
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,240
um you need to collect that data and

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,360
figure it out but that's your your your

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,820
your Market your market value is your

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,939
job as the business right

54
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,540
um but then you've also got your your

55
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,700
um

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,039
organizational capability

57
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,319
right at the bottom of this this this

58
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,300
story in your organizational capability

59
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,599
is two things it's you're you're you're

60
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,520
organization's ability to innovate

61
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,440
and their time to Market

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,520
right those are those are two things

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,140
that

64
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
um people

65
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,220
inside of your business doing the work

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,140
do have full control over

67
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,420
the value discussion is a business

68
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,640
discussion right and scrum can't help

69
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,900
you with that business discussion except

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,540
to tell you that it needs to happen

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,519
right or or help make transparent that

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,019
it needs to happen on the other side of

73
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,459
that you've got your capability and

74
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,319
again it's

75
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,260
scrum just tells you that it needs to

76
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,540
happen right the minimum Cadence in

77
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,640
scrum is monthly

78
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,040
you're expected to have working usable

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,800
product at the end of every month

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,180
um if you don't have that we're you know

81
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,040
we might be doing okay but we're not

82
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,319
doing scrum

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
um if we are able to do that then maybe

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,860
there are things that need to change

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,500
maybe we need better engineering

86
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,080
practices maybe we need to pay back

87
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,700
technical debt maybe we need to look at

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,560
look at other things maybe we need to

89
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,720
look at how quickly we can get features

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,900
into production and and from the value

91
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,540
conversation that anything we come up

92
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,540
with is is is like um

93
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,640
a hypothesis it's perceived value until

94
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,200
we actually get it into production get

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,060
the data from our customers or interview

96
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,560
our customers and get that back into the

97
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,780
into the process

98
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,480
so you might be looking at time to learn

99
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,739
at the bottom there and both of those

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,840
categories ability to ability to to to

101
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,000
innovate right how much time do we spend

102
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,459
adding net new features rather than

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,400
adding

104
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:58,440
incremental features to or inter

105
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,080
incremental capability to existing stuff

106
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,360
net new features is where

107
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,280
it's it's it's where the value is right

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
or potential value is and you're gonna

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,580
have to add a whole bunch of net new

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
features to find that one piece of value

111
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,659
that that is actually valuable so in

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,459
order to do that we've got to get it

113
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:16,500
into production as quickly as possible

114
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,139
which is the

115
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,000
uh time to market right how quickly can

116
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,639
you get those features that you've

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,400
created into market so it's a big

118
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,139
balance here between figuring out what

119
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,320
you need to do for the future the

120
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,259
business needs to take care of that into

121
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,180
um it being existing value and also

122
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,780
figuring out what your your your your

123
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,820
your ability to innovate is and your

124
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,580
time to Market that that creates that

125
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,560
evidence-based management view of your

126
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,820
organization

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,220
um and scrum helps and

128
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,080
um implicitly I think is probably the

129
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,419
best way to describe it implicitly with

130
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,780
many of those things right it tells you

131
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,340
you need to have a product backlog

132
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,900
but it doesn't tell you what goes in

133
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,000
your product backlog or where it comes

134
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,500
from and or how you you maximize the

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,580
value of it right that's a business

136
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,280
decision

137
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,259
it tells you that you need to

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,199
continuously

139
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,780
deliver working usable product but it

140
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,120
doesn't tell you how you're going to do

141
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,400
that what tools you're going to use what

142
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,560
practices and techniques you need in

143
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,919
order to achieve that

144
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,080
so scrum is a tool for making

145
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,699
transparent

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,320
that maybe some of these things are

147
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,620
lacking

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,900
in your organization so in order

149
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,840
to bring that back to the the if you're

150
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,740
in highly competitive markets

151
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,400
scrum enables the transparency you need

152
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,620
as an organization to figure out that

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,440
you're not going fast enough and where

154
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,300
it is you need to fix is it that we're

155
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,340
delivering lots of the wrong features

156
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,400
right because we're monitoring our our

157
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,860
usage is it that we're delivering

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,100
features now that are too late for the

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,320
market maybe our our ability to to get

160
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,919
features into production is too slow is

161
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,720
it because uh the the the we're spending

162
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,520
too much time struggling with the

163
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,320
complexity of our existing product and

164
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
it's very hard to add new features so we

165
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,259
don't add many of them

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,259
right those are all

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
pieces of information that scrum makes

168
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:33,000
transparent that we can then use to

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,460
change but we as the business still need

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,380
to do that change scrum's just going to

171
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,520
tell us there's something wrong we still

172
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,520
need to do something about it
