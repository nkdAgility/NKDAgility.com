1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,480
hey folks

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,879
i thought i would just uh give you a

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,000
little uh show of this oh i've got on

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,240
the wrong monitor so i'm going to be

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,200
looking over here sorry

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,120
um so if i go to my uh mighty networks

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,680
community portal

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,160
um this is my mighty networks community

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
portal and i have a bunch of content and

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
questions and things that people fill

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,640
out and interact with so these are

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
some students just passed at the psk

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,480
this is in a secret area just for those

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,079
psk students you can see it's in the

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,880
particular training

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,800
um but i have content which is this is

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,120
just a public

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,360
right it's a private network but it's

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,559
public for everybody who's in here so i

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,160
asked the question should the scrum

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
master always remove impediments and i'm

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
getting a bunch of

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
previous students and other people who

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,039
are interested who've joined my

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
community

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
answering those questions and

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
interacting

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,520
um i post

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,840
a bunch of things reading lists and

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
content and get interaction and people

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,879
asking questions and

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
all kinds of stuff going on

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,320
um

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,640
i have a training

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,159
and each of these

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
training entities this is the class

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,560
three classes i'm running just now for

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
our company um so there's three

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
um

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
apses and so i've opened this one which

41
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,680
i was teaching today um i've just done

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
the third day

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
students come in

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
this is where they get invited to

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,479
initially the other stuff that they can

46
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
see if they go there they're

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,079
automatically invited to that but they

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
they get in here which is private to

49
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
them

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,159
um and then i have before

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,240
your training and session one

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,280
is open for them normally right at the

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
start

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
and i get them to do some introductions

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,799
and to

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,159
answer some questions there's a question

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
there how do you feel about your scrum

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
knowledge at which they fill out and i

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
want to have you read the scrum guide

60
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
right so just just

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479
stuff

62
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,200
and then the warm-up for session one

63
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,000
fundamentals of scrum i get them to read

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,840
the agi manifesto uh watch uh the

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
introduction to conifen i can't remember

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,479
whose that is it's one of ours it's one

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
of the

68
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,160
things

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,000
uh read the three pillars of empiricism

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
right so there's some content around

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
around that that way i don't have to

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
just teach it they should already know

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
it when they come in

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,760
and then i ask them to write a statement

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
about

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
why transparency is so important for

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
scrum

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
so you can see this is students from

79
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,959
this this particular class not everybody

80
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
has done it there's like 18 students but

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
enough have done it getting people

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
engaged getting people talking about the

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,560
process getting people doing stuff

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
um and then

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
at the end of day

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,920
session one so i do four half-day

87
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
sessions

88
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,360
i open out at the fundamentals of scrum

89
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,560
uh um sorry the wrap up for the

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
fundamentals of scrum so they write

91
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
what

92
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
changed the way we think how does this

93
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,599
new knowledge of complexity right

94
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,280
because we've just talked about the

95
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,840
fundamentals it changed the way you

96
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,920
think a bunch of people

97
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,599
reply um and then they watch something

98
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
watch so this is the

99
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,000
nope i'm on the wrong one there we go um

100
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,959
watch empiricism and is essential

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,879
ours

102
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,159
uh read the new new product development

103
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,159
game right and then write something so

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,640
they write a short summary of what they

105
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
learned and i think one person did this

106
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
right that's okay because these are

107
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,799
suggested this is essential and these

108
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,360
are suggested okay

109
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,840
um and then so that's the warm-up for

110
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
session two is just read the scrum guide

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
um and then

112
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,120
they do session two remember session two

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,239
is just the scrum framework

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,959
um and then i do a wrap-up for that is

115
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,840
what's the big difference between what

116
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,080
we just learned and what you do today uh

117
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
so quite a few people have answered that

118
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,799
you know it gets less as the course goes

119
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,760
through just because

120
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,439
of the topics um so they they watch

121
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,200
ethics in scrum

122
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,760
from ravi uh slaying technical debt

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
uh from

124
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,000
oh i can't remember my brain dies um and

125
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
then write what part do the scrum values

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,439
play

127
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
in scrum and you can see nobody's

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
answered that one and that's okay

129
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
because it was suggested

130
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
right they're doing the essential stuff

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
and not the suggested stuff but they

132
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,320
were really heavily engaged after that

133
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,400
session

134
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,160
verbally and as well as in the in the

135
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,720
class

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,120
and then the warm up for deeper

137
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,560
into into scrum read the scrum guide

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,320
again obviously and i think i just say

139
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
even if you've read it before maybe read

140
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
it again and i have the scrum guide in

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
here so they don't have to go somewhere

142
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
else um

143
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
surprising truth about what motivates us

144
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,120
so read the watch the dan pink video

145
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,800
uh and uh the

146
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
daily crumbs not a status meeting video

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
because i think those are important at

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,040
that point

149
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,600
and then the wrap up for that is

150
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,440
watching uh this video on empathy and

151
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,080
this other one on performance versus

152
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,160
trust both from simon sinek

153
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
uh and then for this new session the

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
um

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
session four tomorrow i've just opened

156
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
out

157
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
uh read

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
uh

159
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,880
changes flipping um which is from uh

160
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
nils

161
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
level of the complexity guy

162
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
um and then in the closing uh which i'll

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,160
open out uh

164
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,160
this wrap-up what outstanding questions

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
do you still have i actually need to

166
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
change oh no there we go i've got i need

167
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
to change this a little bit but um i

168
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,919
asked them to just go to the root of the

169
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
community and ask those outstanding

170
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
questions so they're asked with

171
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
everybody else in the community so maybe

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,120
other people will answer it

173
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,880
uh read the scrum guide write the

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
scrum open assessment and i just have it

175
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
set up like that

176
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
um

177
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,759
reference material so i have the guides

178
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
already in there right and then i'm

179
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,600
going to put links for the pdf and the

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,440
live mural

181
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
and so that's where the material is at

182
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
the end of the day

183
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
they take the psn one assessment so the

184
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,479
full assessment so i've got the

185
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,240
preparing for and some content there i

186
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,160
just copied off the website

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,080
and review the scrum master learning

188
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,560
path oh that's before that i asked them

189
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,160
to write the assessment so do the first

190
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,880
uh um

191
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,319
first assessment before you do the scrum

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,639
master learning path so they know where

193
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
to focus and based on your trainer's

194
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,680
recommendations review the learning path

195
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,680
so i have a uh

196
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,160
should be in that order there we go

197
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
uh review with the trainer so i enable

198
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,319
all the students can just book a 30

199
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,120
minute learning review with me um and we

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,800
just go over their score any problems

201
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
they've got any questions they have they

202
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,520
get 30 minutes it's pretty good

203
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,080
um review the learning path and then you

204
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,400
know collaborate and be part of the part

205
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,160
of the part of the community

206
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,960
so then anytime

207
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
they have have to answer questions um

208
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
i'm going to get them to to go in here

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,319
and some of the questions are going to

210
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,080
oh on the home page there we go

211
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,840
uh some i've just added some questions

212
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
on here so for the next

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
version of this i'm going to ask them to

214
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,280
answer here so it'll be in a more public

215
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,199
space but i do say if they want to

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
answer it privately they can

217
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
but it'd be nice to engage with

218
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,120
everybody else um

219
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,919
yeah that's that's

220
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,599
what i do so i have the the trainings

221
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,000
um which are effectively um

222
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,360
i think they call them courses

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
with

224
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
this stuff course materials an activity

225
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,039
feed

226
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
right so there's a question who are you

227
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,879
and why are you here and they're

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
responding to that there's that question

229
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
how do you feel about your scrum

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
knowledge so this was then before the

231
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
class have you read the scrum guide

232
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
seven people answered it this is for the

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,680
first one

234
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,879
this group's more engaged so if i

235
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
actually go

236
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
back to the second one which is the

237
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,759
group i'm running just now activity feed

238
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,520
why are you here

239
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
well 17 people answered have you read

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
the scrum guide i got 15 people to read

241
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,120
it i mean 50 people to say they've read

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
it but they're pretty good this is a

243
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
good group and then how do you feel

244
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,039
about your scrub knowledge 17 people

245
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
engaging in it so i'm doing i'm doing

246
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
better iteratively getting better at

247
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
getting them engaged in that process

248
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
getting them communicating with each

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,199
other communicating with me on here and

250
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,199
in the class and by having them do some

251
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
prep warm-ups

252
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,919
right and getting them prepped for each

253
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,039
day and wrap-ups um i'm i'm getting them

254
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
to to to think about the content that

255
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
they've

256
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
we've talked about that we've done in

257
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
the class and what's different and that

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
kind of thing so that's really good

259
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,200
um

260
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600

previous sessions and the current

264
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,440
session and if i edit that we'll see

265
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
edit all events there we go

266
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,720

269
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,800
there's a link to the mural in there as

270
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,399
well and if they want to add it to their

271
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,160

and click the meeting link

273
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
the home page it's not it's gone now but

275
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,720

their events that's tomorrow's

278
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,519
class and then i've got a

279
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
meetup that i'm going to so i put that

280
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
in here i've got a conference that i'm

281
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,080
speaking at so i put that in here and

282
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,120
then that's the class next week um

283
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
the the

284
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
these again these are private events

285
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,640
where's the private i think it's in here

286
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,279
it's like

287
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
well anyway it says aps3 that's the

288
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,160
third eps for that customer so that's

289
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
how i manage students um i just get them

290
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,399
in here as soon as possible as soon as

291
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
i've got enough students signed up for a

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,200
class um that i'm gonna run it

293
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
i create it in here i actually have a

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
few i have to go create and so i've got

295
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,079
my

296
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,519
psu on the 10th of january um all that's

297
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,600
just our reference set uh but there's my

298
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
pspo and these are in very oh that's not

299
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
a good one actually because this was

300
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,680
very early on when i started using this

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,120
tool and i didn't have

302
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,800
very much

303
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,000
content in here but you can see i've got

304
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,760
some

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,480
but if i go to the psk which i ran

306
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,399
last week psk and the evm that was the

307
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
two i ran so the psk

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,440
um

309
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,360
i think i have some some stuff i need to

310
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
update it with what i've been doing

311
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,320
recently

312
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,079
um but that's the the the idea

313
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
and there's the activity and i had

314
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,680
students engaging and there we go just

315
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
get two students have passed they're

316
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,920
saying oh we passed does anybody else

317
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,160
pass the assessment um and i think

318
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
that's that's good interaction to have

319
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
but everybody gets to see

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,640
the the main homepage content

321
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,600
this is actually quite a good tool it's

322
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,720
super easy to to to set up

323
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,720
you just go to mightynetworks.com

324
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,320
create your network and and this is what

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
you get and i think my

326
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
billing

327
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,079
like it's not free for sure it's not

328
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,360
free and you can actually have paid pla

329
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,519
there's all sorts of things you can do

330
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,000
that i don't do right because i'm not i

331
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,880
take payments through my website um it's

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,399
not good for timed classes like ours

333
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,560
um but if you had a class that that was

334
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
content delivery you could do that in

335
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
here

336
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
and i think

337
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,320
i don't know where i go see

338
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
martin's

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
pay

340
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,640
what does martin pay where do i see that

341
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,640
click on view profile maybe

342
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,200
no i don't see what martin pays but i

343
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,880
think it's uh uh i think it was

344
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,959
90

345
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
90 a month for

346
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
full branded

347
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
access that's all the features

348
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,480
um

349
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,320
when you're creating content you can

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,760
do live videos

351
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,839
quick posts articles questions and polls

352
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,399
um set up events

353
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,680
and then the idea is that the cohorts

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,040
are just groups right that's just groups

355
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,959
um so i have a professional scrum

356
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,639
a cohort

357
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,880
that i add everybody who's been through

358
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,880
a class not many people post in there

359
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,959
but i also have a trainer cabal

360
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,639
where we talk about some trainer stuff

361
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,600
with the cool trainers that i have and i

362
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,760
have some some content and there's a gym

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
in there um

364
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
yeah it's been pretty useful a couple of

365
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
customer ones but

366
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
that's don't do that

367
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,040
just have

368
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
your main community and then your

369
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,639
trainings and then if you need other

370
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,240
stuff do it from there but don't

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,959
compartmentalize too much it doesn't

372
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,959
doesn't work that well

373
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
well that was just a

374
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
hopefully a useful

375
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
