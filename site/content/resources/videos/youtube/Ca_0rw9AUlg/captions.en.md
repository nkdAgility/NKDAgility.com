There's a quote: "There's no such thing as an agile transformation; it's a cultural transformation." I agree with the part that says there's no such thing as an agile transformation. That's agile transformation, digital transformation, whatever transformation you want to call it. It's not really a thing. But I also disagree that it's a cultural transformation. 

Culture is not something you can change; it's not something you can affect directly. The culture is an outcome of the way you do things, the system, and the way the system engages people. People interact with the system, resulting in the behaviours that create the culture in your organisation. 

So, the easiest way to think about it is: culture is just a shadow on the wall. Right? So if you want to change the shadow on the wall, do you try and change the shadow, or do you change you? You change your position, you change your shape, and then the shadow on the wall changes. 

If you want to make changes to your organisation, if you want to change the way people act in your organisation, if you want to modify the culture of your organisation, you don't actually focus on those things. Those are not the things you change; those are the outcomes. You focus on the system that your organisation has. What are the rules? What are the procedures? What are the practices? What are the ways you measure people within your organisation? What are the principles upon which people make decisions in your organisation? 

When the rules don't fit, those are the things that changing will affect the way your organisation runs, the way it functions, and the way people act within your organisation, which is your organisational culture. 

So, you can't really affect how people act. Well, there my dad's spinning on that one. But if you want to change the way people behave in your organisation, you're going to have to focus on the system. Change the system itself and tweak the system. Make changes; maybe it's small changes, maybe it needs large changes to the system. 

Then monitor the outcomes, which is the culture and the way people act and the behaviours that you see in your organisation. Then keep shifting the system to get the result that you want. So you need to focus on that system; you can't focus on the culture because you can't change culture.
