However, the emphasis on organizational systems—such as decision rights, performance measures, and team autonomy—touches adjacent mechanisms that underpin accountability. There’s moderate conceptual alignment where performance metrics, decision-making authority, and leadership's modeling of behavior indirectly support clarity and outcome ownership. The discussion isn't deep on explicit accountabilities (like Product Owner roles), and the primary intent is to shift thinking from culture-first to system-first, only partially addressing the structural constructs that define accountability. The audience is broadly organizational change agents, Agile practitioners, and leaders, closely matching the intended audience. The narrative is focused with little off-topic material.",
