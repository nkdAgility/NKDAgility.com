1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
there's a there's a there's a quote um

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,599
there's no such thing as an agile

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,880
transformation it's a cultural

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,120
transformation and I agree with the part

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,000
that says there's no such thing as an

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,840
agile transformation that's that's agile

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,359
transformation digital transformation

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,119
whatever transformation you want to call

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,800
it it's it's it's not really a thing but

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,439
I also disagree that it's a cultural

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,759
transformation

12
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,480
culture is not something you can change

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:36,960
it's not something you can affect

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,680
directly the culture is an outcome of

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,800
the way you do

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:46,559
things the

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,000
system and the way the system engages

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,480
people and people interact with the

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,239
system results in the

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,199
behaviors that create the culture in

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,120
your organization so the easiest way to

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,320
think about it is culture is just a

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,080
shadow in the world wall

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,320
right so if you're if you want to change

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
the shadow in the wall do you try and

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,240
change the Shadow or do you change

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,880
you right you change your position you

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,799
change your uh uh shape and then the

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,960
shadow on the wall

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,079
changes so if you want to make changes

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,200
to your

32
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:29,400
organization if you want to change the

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,360
way people act in your organization if

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,960
you want to to modify the culture of

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,159
your organization you don't actually

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
focus on those things those are not the

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,479
things you change those are the

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,479
outcome you focus on the system that

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,880
your organization has what are the rules

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,719
what are the procedures what are the

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,000
practices what are the way you measure

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,119
people within your organization what are

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,799
the principles upon which people make

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,840
decisions in your organization when the

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,640
rules don't fit those are the

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,799
things

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,079
that changing will affect the way your

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,720
organization runs the way it functions

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,920
and the way people act within your

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,560
organization which is your

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,040
organizational culture so you can't

52
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,599
really affect how people act affect

53
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,680
effect effect well there my dad's

54
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:28,040
spinning on that one but um if you want

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,920
to change the way uh people behave in

56
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,040
your organization you're going to have

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,480
to focus on the system change the system

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,360
itself and tweak the system make changes

59
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,720
maybe it's small changes maybe it needs

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,959
large changes to the system and then

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,239
monitor the outcomes which is the

62
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,599
culture and the way people act and the

63
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,879
behaviors that you see in your

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,959
organization and then keep

65
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,720
Shifting the system to get the result

66
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,720
that you want so you need to focus on

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,319
that system you can't focus on the

68
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,760
culture because you can't change culture

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
