Agile transformations are often heralded as the magical solution to organizational dysfunction, promising faster delivery, happier teams, and better outcomes. However, there's a quote that resonates deeply with many Agile professionals: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as an Agile transformation, it‚Äôs a cultural transformation.‚Äù

But let me be honest‚ÄîI half agree with this. While I support the idea that Agile transformation as a standalone concept doesn‚Äôt exist, I also disagree with the idea of a cultural transformation. Why? Because culture isn‚Äôt something you can directly change. In fact, it‚Äôs the outcome of a much deeper process.

In this blog post, I‚Äôll explain why focusing on culture is a misguided approach and why the real transformation happens when you tweak the **system**‚Äîthe rules, procedures, and frameworks within which people operate. So, if you‚Äôre looking to foster lasting change in your organization, this post is for you.

## **The Shadow on the Wall: Understanding Culture‚Äôs Role**

### **Culture Isn‚Äôt the Starting Point**

Imagine this: Culture is like a shadow on the wall. If you want to change the shadow, do you start by trying to manipulate the shadow itself? Of course not. You need to change the object casting the shadow‚Äîyour system, your policies, your frameworks.

The truth is that **culture** is a reflection of how your organization works. It‚Äôs an **outcome**, not a starting point. You can't directly mold culture into what you want, but you can modify the underlying system that creates it. Just like you change your position or shape to alter the shadow on the wall, you must alter your organization‚Äôs system to create the desired behaviors, which will then shape the culture.

### **Focus on What You Can Change**

To make significant and meaningful changes in your organization, you need to shift focus from culture to the **system** that drives it. Ask yourself:

- What are the rules governing our teams?

- How do we measure performance?

- What decision-making frameworks do we use?

- How do people interact with the system and one another?

These are the foundational elements that determine behavior. By **tweaking the system**, you can influence behavior, which in turn shapes the culture.

## **The System Is Key: Change the Right Things**

### **What‚Äôs In the System?**

The system comprises several interconnected parts that affect how people behave within an organization. These include:

- **Processes and procedures**: How tasks are assigned, escalated, or completed.

- **Measurement frameworks**: What metrics do you use to gauge success? Are they individual-focused or team-focused?

- **Decision-making structures**: How are decisions made when rules don‚Äôt fit the situation? Do people have autonomy, or is everything top-down?

When you focus on these areas, you can create **behavioral shifts** that gradually evolve into the culture you desire.

### **Start Small, but Think Big**

One of the key pieces of advice I often give to clients is to **start small**. You don‚Äôt need to overhaul the entire system at once. Sometimes, small tweaks can have significant ripple effects:

- Introduce more **collaborative decision-making**.

- Redefine your **metrics of success** to prioritize team over individual achievements.

- Simplify or remove bureaucratic processes that hinder team autonomy.

Each of these changes starts to shift how people interact with one another and how they view their roles within the organization. Over time, these adjustments lead to behavior changes, which ultimately influence the organizational culture.

### **Personal Experience: Seeing Systemic Change in Action**

I once worked with an organization that believed they were undergoing an "Agile transformation." They tried every Agile framework under the sun‚ÄîScrum, Kanban, Lean‚Äîbut nothing stuck. Why? Because they were focused on the **wrong thing**.

Their approach was top-heavy. They spent time training people to ‚Äúadopt Agile‚Äù without addressing the **systemic** issues that were creating friction. For example, their **performance metrics** were individual-based, creating competition rather than collaboration. Decision-making was highly centralized, leaving teams disempowered.

It wasn‚Äôt until we started tweaking the system‚Äî**changing the metrics** to reward teamwork, flattening the decision-making hierarchy, and introducing **incremental adjustments**‚Äîthat we saw real progress. The culture shifted naturally as a result of these systemic changes.

## **Tweak, Monitor, and Repeat: It‚Äôs an Ongoing Process**

### **Keep Your Eye on the Culture, but Focus on the System**

Once you begin to make changes to the system, it‚Äôs essential to **monitor the outcomes**. Watch how these changes affect the behaviors in your organization. Are people collaborating more? Are they more engaged? Do they feel empowered to make decisions?

If the answer is yes, then you‚Äôre on the right track. However, remember that this process is iterative‚Äîjust like Agile itself. You might need to **tweak the system further**:

- Are certain processes still creating bottlenecks?

- Do some teams need more autonomy, while others require more structure?

- Are your metrics still aligned with your organizational goals?

The point is that you should continuously adjust the system to meet your evolving needs. Over time, the culture will shift to reflect these changes.

### **The Role of Leadership**

Leaders play a critical role in this process. They must model the behaviors they want to see and ensure that the **system supports** those behaviors. Leaders should:

- **Encourage experimentation** and allow teams to find what works best for them.

- **Empower teams** by giving them the autonomy to make decisions within the system.

- **Remove barriers** that prevent teams from operating efficiently.

If you want your teams to be Agile, then the system needs to support Agile behaviors‚Äîand leaders need to champion these changes.

### **Key Takeaways: Practical Steps to Start Changing the System**

So, how can you start focusing on the system to bring about the cultural transformation you‚Äôre aiming for? Here are a few steps:

1. **Evaluate your current system**: Identify where bottlenecks or barriers exist.

3. **Make small, incremental changes**: Start with tweaks to rules, processes, and decision-making frameworks.

5. **Monitor the outcomes**: Observe how these changes impact behavior and culture over time.

7. **Adjust as needed**: Keep refining the system based on what you observe.

9. **Involve leadership**: Ensure that leaders model the behaviors they want to see and remove systemic barriers.

## **Conclusion: Culture Is an Outcome, Not a Lever**

Remember, culture is not something you can change directly. It‚Äôs an outcome of the way your organization‚Äôs system operates. If you want to see long-lasting, meaningful changes in your organization, focus on **changing the system**. By doing so, you‚Äôll naturally shift behaviors, and the culture will follow. üöÄ **Take action now**‚Äîsmall changes lead to big results!
