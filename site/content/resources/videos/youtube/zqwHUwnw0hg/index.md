What will you learn on the professional scrum master course?

The [Professional Scrum Master](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-master-psm-live-virtual-learning-experience-with-certification/) (PSM) course has a large degree of theory relating to scrum than something like the [Applying Professional Scrum](https://nkdagility.com/training/courses/applying-professional-scrum-aps-live-virtual-learning-experience-with-certification/) (APS) course.

It focuses a great deal on the theory of being a scrum master in a scrum team environment.

## Learning from live scrum environments

It’s also a great course from a learning, real-time about the challenges of a scrum master because each class contains wannabe scrum masters, newbie scrum masters, and experienced scrum masters talking about the role, the challenges, and what they would like to learn from the experience.

Your Professional Scrum Trainer is answering questions, in a how to context, from existing scrum masters and it provides newbie and wannabe scrum masters great insights into the role.

- How does scrum work?

- How can a scrum master interact and engage with teams more effectively?

- How to overcome common challenges experienced by scrum masters?

And so forth.

## Learning what the ramifications of a scrum master role are.

Ultimately, you are learning what the ramifications of a scrum master role are.

A lot of people have an idea that a scrum master role is limited exclusively to working with a single scrum team, and there are a lot of reasons why people hold those beliefs, but the role includes a great deal more than being a facilitator of scrum in a team environment.

There are 3 parts to the scrum master role:

1. Scrum master's in service to the developers.

3. Scrum master's in service to the product owner.

5. Scrum master's in service to the organization

A scrum master needs to focus on all three of those elements to be effective in the role because all of those elements impact the team’s ability to create and deliver value throughout the customer journey.

### Example

There is no point in having a great working relationship with the developers and creating a strong team environment without the team being able to deliver a valuable product to a customer. If they are working out of alignment with organizational capabilities and objectives, there is very little value being generated for the organization.

There must be alignment between the organizational and customer objectives, in the context of the scrum team environment, for value to be created, captured, or delivered.

A scrum master is not directly accountable for the quality of the product, not directly accountable for the value being created, but they are directly accountable to creating the environment that determines how EFFECTIVE the scrum team is in creating value for the customer and organization.

That is something that the Professional Scrum Master course focuses a great deal on teaching.

### Foundations in Empiricism.

Empiricism, also known as Empirical Process Control, is an essential process in helping individuals and team navigate uncertainty and complexity.

The pillars of empiricism are Transparency. Inspection. Adaptation.

It is essential that a scrum master understands what empiricism is, why it is such a critical element of both agile and scrum, and how it serves to help teams solve complex problems and create complex solutions, despite uncertainty and complexity in the environments they serve.

The Professional Scrum Master course ensures that a scrum master has a strong, foundational knowledge of empiricism and understands the context of empiricism in product development and value creation throughout the value stream.

### Working Increments in each Sprint

Scrum is built on the core concept of delivering a working, valuable product increment at the end of each sprint. The idea that the customer gets something of value within short, rapid cycles of product development.

The Professional Scrum Master course promotes the value of working, useable product increments such as features and helps the scrum master understand why this is such a core tenet of Scrum.

This draws on the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)’s second value, working software over comprehensive documentation, and provides a context from which the scrum master can understand what the primary goal of each sprint is and why that is true.

If you don’t have a working increment at the end of each sprint:

- You aren’t able to get feedback from customers.

- You aren’t able to mitigate risk.

- You don’t have data to inform what you should focus on next.

- You haven’t created value for customers.

And so forth.

## Summary of the Professional Scrum Master course.

The PSM course focuses on helping the scrum master understand.

- What a scrum master is supposed to do within a scrum team.

- What their primary role and responsibilities are within a scrum team.

- What theory underpins Scrum and why that is critical to success for a scrum team.

- How a scrum master is meant to interact with teams.

- How a scrum master is meant to deal with the organization.

- How a scrum master is meant to deal with individuals outside of the scrum team.

- How to be effective, on a daily basis, within a scrum team environment.

Each Professional Scrum Trainer (PST) brings their own experience, knowledge, and expertise related to working with scrum masters and uses war stories, strong examples, and case studies to demonstrate a point.

They leverage that knowledge and experience to answer questions from course delegates in a way that gives them practical and actionable insights into how they can improve as a scrum master, and how they can solve the problems within their environment.

Following the scrum guide doesn’t solve every problem.

Sometimes, you just need someone that has been there before and knows how to help teams become effective despite adversity and complexity. A great Professional Scrum Trainer does exactly that. They provide context and real-world examples of how to succeed as a scrum master.
