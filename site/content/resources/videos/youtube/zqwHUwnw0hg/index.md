# What will you learn on the professional scrum master course?

In traditional #projectmanagement environments, the #projectmanager acts as an authority in the team environment and actively drives outcomes, supported by senior managers and leadership teams.

In essence, the assign work to people, tell them how to do the work, and specify the time and budget constraints within which the work must be completed.

#agile environments work completely differently. In a #scrumteam, the team are encouraged to self-manage and grow their autonomy independent of anything that resembles micro-management. The experts who are doing the work are considered the best people to make decisions about how best to perform that work and how best to create value for customers.

#agileleadership plays a big role in creating an environment where the team can thrive but the #scrummaster does not tell people what to do, how to do it, and within which timeframes it must be completed. Instead, they act as a servant leader that teaches, coaches, and mentors the team to success.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what you will learn on the professional #scrummaster course (#psm) and how that will help you become a great scrum master.
