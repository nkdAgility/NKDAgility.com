1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,839
so what would you learn on the

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,639
professional scrum Master

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,920
Class yeah that's a great class as well

4
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,119
um so it it there's a lot of theory in

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,760
that class um so the the actual material

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,119
for the class is very Theory based

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,400
whereas the the the aps ditches some of

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,960
the theory in order to have the

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,719
Practical experience uh the PSM f

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,520
focuses very much on the theory and

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,920
being a scrum master so there's lots of

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,559
um lots of exercises where you have

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,399
these people who are W to be perspective

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,920
or currently are scrum Masters in

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:53,680
organizations um discussing and figuring

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,239
out uh how things how things work and go

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,640
together um and how they can interact

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:03,039
with teams better so ultimately I think

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,320
what what you learn is what are the

20
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,600
ramifications of the scrum Master role

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,720
right um so a lot of people have a

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,040
vision of the scrum Master role that it

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,320
is the scrum Master accountability um

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,119
that it is just focused on a team right

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,680
um and there's there's reasons why

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,040
people kind of have that blinkered focus

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,759
on the team uh but really there's three

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,560
there's three parts to the scrum Master

29
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,439
role there's the scrum Master service to

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,040
the team

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,520
the scrum Master's service to the

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
product owner product management right

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,399
and the scrum Master service to the

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
organization and they need to be able to

35
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,200
focus at all of those levels in order to

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,479
be effective cuz all of those things

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,840
affect the ability of the team to

38
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,079
deliver value and deliver usable working

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,960
product right there's no point in the

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,479
focusing just on the team and the team

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,560
being awesome and fantastic at

42
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,000
delivering they're doing continuous

43
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,560
delivery but they're delivering nothing

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,200
that's useful to the customers so the

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,240
scrum Master well not directly

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,520
accountable for the value or directly

47
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,120
accountable for the quality is directly

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,840
accountable

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,760
for them being

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
effective at what it is that they're

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,440
doing and that's what we try and get

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,400
across in uh the PSM um along with

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,519
foundations in empiricism and the

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,440
ultimate

55
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,440
value of usable working increments of

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,000
work on a regular Cadence CU if you

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,400
don't have a usable working increment

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
then you're not able to get feedback

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,440
you're not able to mitigate risk right

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,959
those are those are things that are so

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,000
important in that story so the PSM is

62
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,599
really the hitting on um from a theory

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,480
perspective all of the the the the basic

64
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,920
capabilities of what is the scrum Master

65
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,720
what they're supposed to be able to do

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,879
on a day-to-day basis um how they're

67
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
supposed to interact with the

68
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,000
organization opening up the scope of

69
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,200
their work um and figuring that out but

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,560
I think there's there's there's really

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,879
more to it than that

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,120
because each

73
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,640
trainer brings their knowledge of

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,799
working with

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,560
organizations of helping people who are

76
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:26,280
scrum Masters deal with their problems

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,599
in

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,280
organizations so there's a piece of the

79
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:34,239
course which is the cours Weare and the

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,000
theory um and then there's also another

81
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,760
piece of the course which is the the the

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,640
trainers experience right the all of our

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,280
trainers are not just trainers they are

84
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,159
also people who are coaches Consultants

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,760
um in in in devops in um in agile in

86
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,439
whatever it is that that they've been

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,840
doing for years and they're able to

88
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,400
bring that those experienced stories and

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,319
I actually feel like there's a third

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,519
layer there's a third layer in there

91
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,200
that is the The Meta conversation about

92
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,200
how the trainer is running the

93
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,920
class and those are skills that the

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,239
scrum Masters can also take on board to

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,239
help them run the events that they

96
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,959
they're doing in scrum right so how do

97
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,000
you how do you run a daily standup

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,680
effectively how do you um have people

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,800
organized together when you've got a

100
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,320
larger group of people turn up what

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,199
happens if you get 70 people at the a

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,960
Sprint view right um how do you make

103
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,720
sure that you get information from all

104
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,199
of them and and all of our our trainers

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
are they they use it in different levels

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,360
based on their taste right so

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,720
everybody's different um but we have

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,600
folks that that that use and talk about

109
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,199
trading from the back of the room um

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,320
lots of liberating structures right in

111
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,639
able to engage people and while we're

112
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,400
not explicitly teaching those

113
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,520
things we're using those things to

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,840
facilitate and run the class what which

115
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,520
enables the more advanced scrum Masters

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,479
in the room right who maybe aren't the

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,400
the the the one ofes or the maybe going

118
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,720
to get the jobs but the actual doing it

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,720
just now to have a a a an extra level of

120
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,120
Engagement understanding and learning

121
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,120
that they can take from the class as

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
well
