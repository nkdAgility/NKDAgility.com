Although it discusses feedback loops, experimentation, and applying learning in real contexts, these are tied to learner experience—not explicitly to defining, measuring, or driving customer outcomes as described in the classification. Key focus is on internal team/learner improvement, not direct customer value. There are some tenuous links—such as applying learning in real-world settings and feedback—but they do not explicitly connect to real customer impact, user validation, or tailoring delivery to customer needs. The language emphasizes practical advice for Agile coaches and Scrum Masters, aligning well for practitioners, but the discussion remains internal to the team/process space rather than outwardly customer-driven. Signal-to-noise is decent; little extraneous material, but customer focus is not the topic. No penalties for outdated or contradictory content were necessary.",
