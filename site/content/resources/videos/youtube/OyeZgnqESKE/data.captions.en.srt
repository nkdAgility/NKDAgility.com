1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,840
another reason I love the immersive

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,000
learning experience for students is

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,080
because it maintains a a a level of

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,040
excitement of newness there's um new

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,600
things to be discovered each session and

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,080
I find that because people are able to

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,279
try things in their organization they

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,039
feel excited to come every week it's not

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:32,480
a trial it's a um it's a discovery of

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,239
new topics new things and because they

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,840
get time to assimilate it keep coming

12
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,840
back around continuous learning
