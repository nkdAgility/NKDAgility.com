Another reason I love the immersive learning experience for students is because it maintains a level of excitement of newness. There are new things to be discovered each session, and I find that because people are able to try things in their organisation, they feel excited to come every week. It's not a trial; it's a discovery of new topics, new things. And because they get time to assimilate it, they keep coming back around for continuous learning.
