1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,980
why shouldn't this what do people know

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,880
about devops

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,160
um

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,120
but really don't

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,600
I well the first thing especially for

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,960
I have been a Microsoft MVP in Azure

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,519
devops for uh 14 years

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,960
so lots of people when they say devops

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,580
around me

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,940
um they mean as your devops they mean

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,180
the tooling and that's quite often the

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,739
case with a lot of these these uh when

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,780
they talk about the work what they mean

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,579
is jira right the the the the tool is

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,399
not the value

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,640
the tool is just there to help you

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,420
surface the value or leverage the value

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,579
that that comes with that idea

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,920
um so the thing that people know about

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,500
devops but really don't is that it's

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,180
it's not uh

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,280
it's not a tool

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,340
it's not a

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,920
process it's not a practice it's an idea

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,299
right and it's really that idea born

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,340
very specifically in software

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,000
engineering right I mean that's that's

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,119
really where where devops focuses

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,340
um around how do we

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,200
if we're talking about agile and we're

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,580
talking about getting faster at doing

32
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,460
stuff

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,439
what's the impact of that on our

34
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,740
Engineering Systems what's the impact of

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,540
that on the way we create our product

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,880
the way we approach our product the way

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,619
we design our product what is the impact

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,360
that enables us to shorten those

39
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,180
feedback loops

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,520
um Beyond just talking about it right

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,380
because agile is the people in process

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,520
part and devops is the

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,299
wow

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,840
the the the the the the nebulous part of

45
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,180
the not just the tools man that's hard

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,399
to describe right

47
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,599
um devops is just an idea just like

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,940
agile's just an idea so tools may help

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,920
you but figuring out

50
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,920
how you're going to use those tools or

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,780
how those tools uh work I I had some

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,200
great conversations

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,860
um with a gentleman Who was the the

54
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,620
almost the source of Team Foundation

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,959
server originally uh Visual Studio team

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,780
Services as it was called the first time

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,400
round and the ideas behind it which is a

58
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,680
gentleman called Sam guggenheimer

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,080
there's a great Twitter account which is

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,420
what would Sam say which is his people

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,280
that worked with him created because he

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,319
would see all sorts of I don't know

63
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,000
clever and interesting and funny for the

64
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,140
rest of us stuff

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,200
um but Sam had this laser focus looking

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,680
forward into the future what do we need

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,580
going forward looking out into the

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,720
future in order to support this idea of

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,720
devops

70
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,319
and TFS and his journey into Azure

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,959
devops right is the result of that

72
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,840
thinking not the cause of that thinking

73
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
right the tools are not the cause the

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,080
idea is the cause and the tools are

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,080
there to support it

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,300
and that's I think what people

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,540
understand about devops but really

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,420
really don't because they always default

79
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,819
to the tool the tool the tool no it's

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,640
default to the idea and the tool

81
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,840
supports that idea

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,840
um and that's where you want to be

83
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,319
