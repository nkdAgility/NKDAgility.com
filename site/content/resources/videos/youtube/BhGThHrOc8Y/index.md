When I think about [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), I often find myself reflecting on the misconceptions that surround it. As someone who has been a Microsoft MVP in [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) for 14 years, I’ve seen firsthand how the term "DevOps" can be misinterpreted. Many people, when they mention DevOps in my presence, are actually referring to Azure DevOps—the tools that come with it. But let me be clear: the tool is not the value. The tool is merely a means to surface or leverage the value that comes from the underlying idea of DevOps.

### Understanding DevOps: More Than Just Tools

So, what is it that people think they know about DevOps but really don’t? The first thing to grasp is that DevOps is not a tool, a process, or even a practice. It’s an idea—a concept that originated in the realm of software engineering. 

- **DevOps as an Idea**: At its core, DevOps is about understanding how we can improve our engineering systems. It’s about asking critical questions:
  - How does our approach to Agile impact the way we create our products?
  - What changes can we make to shorten feedback loops?
  - How do we design our products with agility in mind?

These questions are essential for anyone looking to embrace the true spirit of DevOps.

### The Relationship Between Agile and DevOps

While Agile focuses on the people and processes involved in [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}), DevOps delves into the nebulous aspects of how we can enhance those processes through collaboration and integration. It’s not just about the tools we use; it’s about how we think about our work and the systems we create.

I remember having enlightening conversations with Sam Guggenheimer, one of the original minds behind Team Foundation Server (TFS) and later Azure DevOps. His vision was always forward-thinking, focusing on what we needed to support the idea of DevOps. 

- **Tools as Support**: TFS and Azure DevOps are products of that vision, not the driving force behind it. The tools are there to support the idea of DevOps, not to define it. This is a crucial distinction that many people overlook.

### Shifting the Focus

The challenge lies in shifting our focus from the tools to the ideas they support. When we default to thinking about tools, we miss the bigger picture. 

- **Embrace the Idea**: Instead of asking, "What tool should I use for DevOps?" we should be asking, "How can I leverage the principles of DevOps to improve my team's performance and product quality?"

This mindset shift is vital for anyone looking to truly understand and implement DevOps effectively.

### Final Thoughts

In conclusion, DevOps is a powerful idea that can transform the way we approach software development. It’s about fostering a culture of collaboration, [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}), and responsiveness to change.
