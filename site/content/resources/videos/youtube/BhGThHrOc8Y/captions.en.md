Why shouldn't this? What do people know about DevOps but really don't? 

I, well, the first thing, especially for... I have been a Microsoft MVP in Azure DevOps for 14 years. So lots of people, when they say DevOps around me, they mean Azure DevOps. They mean the tooling, and that's quite often the case with a lot of these... when they talk about the work, what they mean is Jira, right? The tool is not the value. The tool is just there to help you surface the value or leverage the value that comes with that idea.

So the thing that people know about DevOps but really don't is that it's not a tool. It's not a process. It's not a practice. It's an idea, right? And it's really that idea born very specifically in software engineering, right? I mean, that's really where DevOps focuses. 

Um, around how do we... if we're talking about Agile and we're talking about getting faster at doing stuff, what's the impact of that on our engineering systems? What's the impact of that on the way we create our product, the way we approach our product, the way we design our product? What is the impact that enables us to shorten those feedback loops? 

Um, beyond just talking about it, right? Because Agile is the people and process part, and DevOps is the... wow, the nebulous part of the... not just the tools, man, that's hard to describe, right? 

Um, DevOps is just an idea, just like Agile's just an idea. So tools may help you, but figuring out how you're going to use those tools or how those tools work... I had some great conversations with a gentleman who was the almost the source of Team Foundation Server originally, Visual Studio Team Services, as it was called the first time round, and the ideas behind it, which is a gentleman called Sam Guggenheimer. 

There's a great Twitter account which is "What Would Sam Say?" which is his people that worked with him created because he would see all sorts of, I don't know, clever and interesting and funny for the rest of us stuff. 

Um, but Sam had this laser focus looking forward into the future. What do we need going forward, looking out into the future in order to support this idea of DevOps? 

And TFS and his journey into Azure DevOps, right, is the result of that thinking, not the cause of that thinking, right? The tools are not the cause; the idea is the cause, and the tools are there to support it. 

And that's, I think, what people understand about DevOps but really, really don't, because they always default to the tool, the tool, the tool. No, it's default to the idea, and the tool supports that idea. 

Um, and that's where you want to be.
