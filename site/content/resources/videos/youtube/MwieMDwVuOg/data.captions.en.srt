1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,640
scaling isn't about moving fast it's

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,000
about moving smart sustainably because

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,080
if you scale too quickly without the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,200
right foundations you're just

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,240
accelerating towards a bigger mess now

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,359
agile gives us a way to scale but let's

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,800
be clear it's not just about picking a

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,560
framework and running with it Nexus less

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
disend agile they all bring structure

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,520
but structure alone doesn't guarantee

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,000
success the real question is are you

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,879
scaling for sustainability for

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,480
resilience or for Value what happens too

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,879
often is organizations reach a Tipping

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,280
Point realize they need more

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,600
coordination more alignment and they

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,719
just slap a framework on top of what

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,600
they already do but Frameworks don't fix

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,320
systemic issues they expose them if

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,039
you're struggling to deliver value now

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,519
scaling isn't going to fix that it's

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,119
going to magnify it that's where NE

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,640
agility comes in we don't just Implement

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,799
Frameworks we help organizations build

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
the capability to steal in a way that

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,119
actually works for them it's about

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,759
understanding your current constraints

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,200
your bottlenecks your organizational

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,079
design then we use agile not as a set of

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,680
rules but as an enabler because here's

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,880
the thing agile isn't about complexity

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,159
it's about simplification the right

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,720
teams working on the right things with

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,439
the shortest possible path to Value

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,479
that's how you scale successful so if

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,719
you're thinking about scaling ask

37
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,479
yourself are we just growing bigger or

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,399
are we setting ourselves up to deliver

39
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:55,600
better value because one leads to chaos

40
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,600
the other competitive advantage
