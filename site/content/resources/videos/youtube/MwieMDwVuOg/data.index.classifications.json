    "reasoning": "While the content repeatedly references 'value' and cautions against scaling for its own sake, it does not explicitly define or measure value from the customer’s perspective, nor does it detail how customer outcomes inform strategy or delivery. The focus is mainly on organisational growth, simplification, and agile as an enabler, with only indirect suggestions of customer value (e.g., 'shortest path to value,' 'delivering better value'). Depth and intent are limited with respect to explicit Customer Focus; audience match is higher, as practitioners and leaders are addressed, but detailed customer-oriented practices or metrics are lacking.",

Instead, it focuses on value delivery, simplification, and systemic issues—these are more general best practices, not specifically first principles.
