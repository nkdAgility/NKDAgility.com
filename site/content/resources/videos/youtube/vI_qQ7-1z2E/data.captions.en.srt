1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:13,740
question is is the PSM 2 course

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,839
or psme right an advanced scrum Master

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,880
Class

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,060
validation of your skills or does it

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,500
develop your skills and capability as a

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,859
scrum master

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,779
and I think it's the latter right

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,019
um there's there's

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,120
if you if you're coming to A A PSM an

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,280
advanced scrum master class and you're

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,600
just validating your skills go take the

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
assessment and don't bother with the

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,980
class right that's that's that's the way

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,680
I would think about it

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,680
um and I feel that there's actually not

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,260
in implementation there's actually not

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,840
that much relationship between the

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:57,000
intent of the PSM the advanced scrum

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,160
master class and the intent of the psm2

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,980
assessment right they're they're

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,339
slightly different things

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,920
and I think the class is much broader in

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,619
that it's designed to develop your skill

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
and capability as a scrum master

25
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,500
whereas the assessment is just assessing

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,680
the knowledge part of that story

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,479
um so a key key differentiator is that

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,820
the the advanced scrum Master Class

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,560
focuses on

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,640
um facilitation it focuses on the scrum

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,000
Master being a professional scrum Master

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,360
rather than just an admin for the team

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,960
which often happens right it focuses on

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,780
that difference between uh being given

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,240
the job title of scrum master and

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,579
fulfilling the accountability of the

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,720
scrum master that it talks about in the

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,540
scrum guide

39
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,500
that's that's the real purpose of of the

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,299
class with a whole bunch of uh the way

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,119
it kind of does it is

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,799
that's the story of the class right and

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,039
then we're going to talk about not just

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,319
that part but what is the scrum Master's

45
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,879
accountability to the team what's the

46
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,140
scrum Master's accountability to the

47
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,819
product owner what's the score Master's

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,220
accountability to the organization right

49
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:21,300
that's the story of the class

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,959
but in teaching the class

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,020
and participating in the class

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,300
we're using facilitation techniques to

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,300
help the students understand those

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,879
things that also teaches them how to use

55
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,700
those facilitation techniques

56
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,879
right so a

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,200
the way I teach the class it we I use a

58
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,500
lot of liberating structures in the

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
class uh we I use a lot of strings of

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,379
liberating structures so Liberty

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,180
structures connected together to get to

62
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,580
a kind of longer outcome so a bunch of

63
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,780
exercises that go towards a an overall

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,900
story

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,340
and I try and explain the meta process

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,440
in the class as we're going through like

67
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,720
what is the the the exercise that we're

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,940
doing why are we doing it what's the

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,980
outcome that I'm trying to achieve

70
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,340
and then we've actually done the

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,800
exercise you've experienced that how

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,680
could you leverage that as a tool to use

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
with your students as well or not your

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,340
students of your scrum master your your

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,780
teams your organization the people that

76
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,019
you're going to be working with

77
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,800
so learning those facilitation

78
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:30,900
techniques learning to leverage

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,000
liberating structures is for me a huge

80
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,800
part of that class it's not the only

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,840
part right because there's also the

82
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,340
story of the class

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,879
um but then there's the techniques that

84
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,239
we use to get there so so for me that

85
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,640
classes are almost entirely about

86
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,799
um the skill and capability of you as a

87
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,060
scrum Master both from the perspective

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,120
of

89
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,440
how do I become a better scrum master

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,379
and understand the scrum Master

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,060
accountability more but also that meta

92
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,459
process of what are the tools and

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,379
techniques that I can use to do those

94
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,659
things with teams

95
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:11,879
and included in the class is a whole

96
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:14,640
bunch of effectively take away exercises

97
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,720
um that we have we have uh posters we

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,180
have

99
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,280
um cards we have exercise content that

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,320
we provide you at the end of the class

101
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,840
that you can then go do some of those

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,660
exercises with your teams

103
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,060
and in fact I can imagine

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,860
um as we move towards

105
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,720
um a more immersive learning model

106
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,360
that what we'll do with some of those

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,699
exercises is you know will teach you how

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,100
to run the exercise and then we'll send

109
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:46,500
you off as a scrum Master to go run that

110
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,080
exercise next week with your team and

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,940
then you come back the week after and

112
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,860
tell us how you get up got on what were

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,419
the difficulties you hit how could you

114
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,340
have run it better what did you learn

115
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,900
share that with everybody and then we'll

116
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,020
talk about the next bit teach the next

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,660
exercise and then you go off and to use

118
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,160
it with your with your team and that

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,699
would be the immersive version of the

120
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,780
psm2 which I think would be fantastic

121
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,320
um

122
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,320
