    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the PSM II course, its role in developing Scrum Master skills, facilitation, and accountability. While it addresses empowerment and skill growth, it does not mention or substantially explore Agentic Engineering principles like systemic observability or DevOps-infused craft. The focus remains on individual capability within Scrum rather than deliberate agentic engineering or human/AI agency maximization. Therefore, mentions and conceptual alignment are low, as is depth. The audience aligns somewhat with Agentic Engineering practitioners, but the bulk of the discussion is about Scrum-based professional development rather than engineering of agency-driven environments.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article centers on skill growth and advanced facilitation for Scrum Masters—relevant to personal development but not Agentic Engineering. It lacks focus on designing engineering systems for human or AI agency, so alignment with the category is limited and confidence low.",

There are no mentions or exploration of agentic software delivery concepts such as autonomous agents, AI, contextual intelligence, or modern engineering practices described in the classification definition. The audience, theme, and intent are tightly aligned with Scrum mastery, not with integrating AI or agentic principles into software delivery. Therefore, the overlap with 'Agentic Software Delivery' is minimal and only faintly plausible through an extremely indirect connection to modern organisational practices.",
