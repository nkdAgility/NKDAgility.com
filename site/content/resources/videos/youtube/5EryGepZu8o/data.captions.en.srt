1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,980
foreign

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,780
if you could teach just one thing about

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,900
scrum

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,580
what would it be

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,039
I think it wouldn't be scrum at all that

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,039
would be the first principles right it

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,500
would be empiricism and complexity

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,460
that's that's what I would teach and in

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:34,980
fact that's probably what I spend the

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,980
majority of my time in the EPS in

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,780
um when I'm just talking to people

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,219
um engaging with leadership that's what

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,460
I spend the majority of my time talking

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,980
about is empiricism and complexity

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,280
and

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,940
if you have those fundamental ideas of

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,039
empiricism and complexity of the the the

18
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,780
understanding the realization

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,539
that

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,699
no matter what

21
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,559
way you choose to do stuff it might not

22
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,320
always work it might have different

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,720
outcomes depending on the current

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,880
circumstances the prevailing wind right

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,360
then

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,640
um you realize why

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,260
people realize why things don't always

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,759
work out for them they realize why

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,500
things are different they realize why

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,020
things are difficult they realize why

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,299
you you don't always get a successful

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,979
Sprint no matter how hard you try you

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,280
realize why you can't normalize

34
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,320
normalize your your your your number of

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,720
story points delivered per Sprint you

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,600
realize why story points becomes

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,200
ultimately been effective right

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,900
um beyond the team you realize

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:49,259
why for a lot of those things you people

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,200
and teams can take those ideas and run

41
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,079
with them themselves

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,799
and I I don't believe that that scrum

43
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,560
should be forced upon teams I think they

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
should choose themselves how they work

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,579
and if they want to take and use

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
principles of scrum then then I'm here

47
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,520
to help them

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,340
um but if you want to use other stuff

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,440
I'll help them with that too

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,680
but they should be making those choices

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,980
with a clear and concise understanding

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,200
of complexity and empiricism so that

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,760
they can ultimately make more of the

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,739
right choices and less of the wrong ones

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,739
and I think that's hard and I think

56
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,560
that's that's missing in a lot of the

57
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't know a better word than

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,680
boilerplate

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,260
teachings of

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,200
um you know the the the the mechanisms

61
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,360
in scrum doing mechanical scrum is is

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,819
not useful at all people have to

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,280
understand why each of those things in

64
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,300
scrum is in place why it provides them

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,400
with value why taking it away what's the

66
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,220
result of taking it away what what

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,840
happens what what doesn't happen

68
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,099
um and why we want to keep those things

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,099
I think that's so important

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,060
