1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,240
The questions, if you
could teach just one thing

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,040
about Scrum,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,280
what would it be?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,440
I think it wouldn't be Scrum
at all, it would be the first principles,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,160
right? It would be
empiricism and complexity.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,950
That's what I would teach.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:29,950
And in fact, that's probably
what I spend the majority

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,740
of my time in the APS,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,060
in when I'm just talking to people,

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,680
engaging with leadership,
that's what I spend the majority of

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,820
my time talking about is
empiricism and complexity.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,600
And

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,630
if you have those fundamental ideas

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,220
of empiricism and complexity,

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,680
the understanding, the realization

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,960
that no matter what
way you choose to do stuff,

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,790
it might not always work,
it might have different outcomes depending

18
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,190
on the current circumstances,
the prevailing wind, right?

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:18,420
Then you realise why people realise
why things don't always work out for them.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,520
They realize why things are different.
They realize why things are difficult.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,440
They realize why you don't always
get a successful sprint,

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,900
no matter how hard you try.

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,160
You realize why you can't normalize
your number of story points delivered

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,220
per sprint. You realize
why story points

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,290
becomes ultimately ineffective, right,

26
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,100
beyond the team. You realize
why for a lot of those things.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,400
People and teams can take those ideas
and run with them themselves.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,060
And I don't believe that Scrum
should be forced upon teams.

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,770
I think they should choose
themselves how they work.

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,960
And if they want to take
and use principles of Scrum then

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm here to help them

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,060
but if they want to
use other stuff I'll help them

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,140
with that too

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,450
but they should be making those choices
with a clear and concise understanding

35
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,820
of complexity and empiricism so
that they can ultimately make more

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,000
of the right choices
and less of the wrong ones.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,700
And I think that's hard
and I think that's missing in a lot

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,320
of the, I

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,498
don't know a better word
than boilerplate teachings

40
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:40,860
of the mechanisms in Scrum,
doing mechanical Scrum is not useful

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,610
at all.

42
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,070
People have to understand why each
of those things in Scrum is in place,

43
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,300
why it provides them
with value, why taking it away,

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,870
what's the result
of taking it away, what happens,

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,180
what doesn't happen,

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,180
and why we want to keep those things.
I think that's so important.
