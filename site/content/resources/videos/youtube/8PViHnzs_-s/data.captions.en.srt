5
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,680
yeah i'm you know one of those fake

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,680
backgrounds like no although

7
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
i'm just checking the checking the

8
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,159
stream

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,040
the problem is the delay

10
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
so hopefully

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,399
it'll do

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,599
something in a sec

13
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,599
wow that's a big delay

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,520
so what are we on for time here

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
um

37
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,520
the the

38
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,240
the fewer the people that are here the

39
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,479
more of your questions you get answered

40
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,800
right that's how that works

41
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,319
uh so what i'm going to do

42
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,080
first off

43
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
is we're going to do a little uh

44
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,919
exercise around connections

45
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
um so i'm going to

46
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,800
create

47
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,720
uh i'm actually i'm going to create

48
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
three rooms but i'm only going to use

49
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,319
two of them

50
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,400
um but it's just in case because you

51
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,000
know what it's like these days everybody

52
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,199
turns up late

53
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
to meetings because they've got to

54
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
finish up whatever else they're doing

55
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
and they forget and

56
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,440
all of this kind of thing and then

57
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
uh

58
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,639
we can figure that out so let's do room

59
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,960
one

60
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,800
room one and then room two and room two

61
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,960
okay so what i'm going to do is i'm

62
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
going to uh

63
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,280
pop you into a room just in pairs just

64
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,520
now but if other people arrive it will

65
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,800
kind of slot them into

66
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,680
the right room um and on the mural uh

67
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
let me summit

68
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,199
summon to the mural i think everybody's

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
around here anyway

70
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,960
uh there is uh just some some questions

71
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
to get us started thinking about

72
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
uh uh i'm gonna take off the mark each

73
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,720
statement true or false because that's

74
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,680
not what we're doing not green and red

75
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
ticks uh but just go round the questions

76
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
uh um and see

77
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,720
have a little conversation around them

78
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,080
and and introduce yourselves to each

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,759
other all right so i'm gonna open the

80
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,840
rooms and i'll set a timer for five

81
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,520
minutes in the mural and and then we'll

82
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,000
we'll come back and that'll give the

83
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,319
rest of folks a little bit of time to

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319

i can pop up on the screen that shows

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,880
how to configure the settings that would

151
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,560
be uh

152
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,240
a good thing so let me let me check

153
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,320
andre and see

154
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
um can you hear me

155
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
yes

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
all right so so in the in the settings

157
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,440
for teams uh if you if you click on the

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,440
little

159
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,600
can you not hear me

160
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
oh

161
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,839
yeah yeah well you can type i know but

162
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
then it's lots of writing

163
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,320
let me see if i can take a

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,040
screenshot

165
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,040
of the device things

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,920
for you

167
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,240
i will explain very quickly i was in a

168
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:44,240
zoo meeting and then my

169
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,120
audio crashed and then i had

170
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,040
eggs in the

171
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
little volume and

172
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,120
i don't know what's wrong with this let

173
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,120
me detect problem detecting problem

174
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
that that's why i don't use zoom that

175
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
just solves that problem although anna

176
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,320
would say that's why you shouldn't use

177
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,240
teams switch the teams but that's uh

178
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,519
well i i think it's a problem with the

179
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,120
computer because

180
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
he was kind of the icons

181
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
so it looks like

182
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,839
he was having some problems that's okay

183
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,800
she'll pop she'll pop back and and we'll

184
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,639
get we'll get laundry as well

185
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,079
so

186
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,800
sometimes

187
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,880
everything works perfectly and sometimes

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,160
it just doesn't

189
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,560
just

190
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,360
yeah yeah just like just like

191
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,959
the complex systems that we work with

192
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,839
yeah

193
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,279
uh so there's about a minute left on the

194
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
on the time box

195
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
um we'll see oh there we go on andre i

196
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,519
should be able to

197
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
i can invite you to join that team's

198
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
meeting now it's realized that you're

199
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,760
not there

200
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,440
did that work

201
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,120
nope it doesn't work

202
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
yep it's okay

203
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
you you might you might be one of the

204
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,800
the unique

205
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,560
valuable people that i'm not going to

206
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,240
ever be able to send out to a breakout

207
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,839
room that might

208
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
might be something that happens i have

209
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
had that before um so if that's the case

210
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
then i'll i'll have one less breakout

211
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,920
room and we can treat this as a breakout

212
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,199
room um

213
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,199
i have had to do that before

214
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
i'm going to struggle pronouncing

215
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,360
pronouncing that

216
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
uh who who's seen i think it's just

217
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
hussein isn't it

218
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,680
it's his name his name

219
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,000
okay

220
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,399
and oh no another one

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,399
mine

222
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,720
awesome i got that one right

223
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,600
here

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,920
i am just going to we

225
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,920
yay

226
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
i i'm just going to close the breakout

227
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,120
rooms and bring the rest of uh the folks

228
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,399
back so let me close them all um

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
we do have other people here that were

230
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,279
just off um

231
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,000
talking about it's okay it's okay that's

232
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,000
why that's why we have this exercise at

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,440
the start because people are late they

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
struggle with the technology their

235
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,880
computers doesn't work sometimes

236
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,000
all of those things

237
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
yes

238
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,040
the planets are not aligned

239
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,680
in a way that the breakout rooms work or

240
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,680
however that happens

241
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,160
so i am interested in a couple people

242
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,079
that did manage to get into the breakout

243
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
rooms any insights

244
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
they might have had about this topic

245
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,680
because

246
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,279
it may be one that you haven't thought

247
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,720
about before

248
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,000
russia have you

249
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
what did you discuss in your breakout

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,079
room what were the important things

251
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,000
uh

252
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,680
first we we tried to

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,399
to know each other and to visit each

254
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,199
other because both two of us is in you

255
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
and one kind of expert or have more

256
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,279
experience in scrum

257
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
brinkley and

258
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,800
we

259
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
kind of try to get into the system more

260
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
to

261
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
apply and find the question and we

262
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,680
discussed just the first one which is

263
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,320
why transparency is important and as we

264
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,040
understand that from the strong point

265
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,920
i'm still as i said

266
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,519
about the transparency in investigation

267
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,480
and um

268
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,160
adapt so in term to get into the room

269
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,639
and they have the

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,199
update and i like for the product itself

271
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,519
for for the service or you think project

272
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,079
that okay you need to have this kind of

273
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,800
in transparency in order to investigate

274
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,079
and

275
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
and

276
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,720
and adapt with the team

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,519
so

278
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,360
and then the time is finished

279
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,440
we definitely made a short amount of

280
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,079
time for sure

281
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,959
uh would anybody else like to

282
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,959
add their discussion

283
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,000
maybe maybe anna you were in the in room

284
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
one

285
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,199
yeah but we did just the same just

286
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,199
introducing each other and that was it

287
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,520
that is absolutely okay when we meet new

288
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,440
people we want to get to know them a

289
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,840
little bit don't we

290
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,200
right but

291
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,919
is time meeting make the first roaming

292
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,919
station it

293
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,000
just so people know each other and get

294
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,080
competitors

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
that is definitely part of the point of

296
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
that first exercise there's not meant to

297
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,200
be really any learnings that come out of

298
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,760
that is just to get us get us going and

299
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,320
get us at talking about the topic and i

300
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
think uh russia you're the first person

301
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
in one of these free sessions that has

302
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
held up a scrum guide for us

303
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,039
um it's been a long time since i've seen

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,400
a printed copy uh

305
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
but uh yeah that's that's

306
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,000
when your organization's getting started

307
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,760
a good sign is lots of copies of the

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
scrum guide printed out for people to

309
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
read

310
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
yeah because

311
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,600
you get it kind of if you've not read it

312
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,000
which i find lots of people haven't

313
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,880
right even people that are um consider

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,679
themselves maybe maybe veterans

315
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,520
of the scrum world and they've not read

316
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,919
the scrum guide and i'm kind of

317
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,760
okay how much of a veteran can you be if

318
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,760
you haven't even read the rules

319
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,039
right the rules of engagement

320
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
uh if you don't know what they are

321
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,960
you're gonna make uh you're gonna make a

322
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
mistake

323
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,360
uh so this this topic

324
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,640
today uh was was was anna's idea

325
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,720
um so

326
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,080
uh are there any introductions you would

327
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,760
like to add

328
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,679
anna

329
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,880
well um

330
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,240
i i

331
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,400
propose this

332
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,880
because i find many times that in

333
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,760
organizations

334
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,120
uh commitments it's like

335
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,360
not really

336
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,840
well understood and it's taken from the

337
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,120
idea of the old television

338
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
uh thing

339
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,039
and

340
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,840
we see our managers as soon as her

341
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,120
commitment for specific things

342
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,120
and i find this very useful um

343
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,600
uh to to

344
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,720
to clear up our ideas even mine

345
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,559
and and we have some takeaways to drop

346
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
into our organizations

347
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,440
to be able to explain to what we really

348
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,760
have to commit instead of committing to

349
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,000
things that really don't matter

350
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
yeah or or maybe have a negative impact

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
we commit to things that can often have

352
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
a negative impact on on the way we

353
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,440
deliver on on on our business and you

354
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,120
know those are the two the the common

355
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,760
difficulty that people have moving

356
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,760
towards commitments in organizations

357
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,159
is that it's it

358
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,760
it's very different it's a very

359
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
different outlook

360
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,840
from the traditional project management

361
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
practices that we all know

362
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,400
right

363
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
and most people in our organization know

364
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,919
them most people have been exposed to

365
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,679
them and then we start talking about

366
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,679
something different so they try and fit

367
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,000
the old way into the new words and you

368
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
try and fit the old way into the new

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,840
words you're suddenly still doing the

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
old thing you're just calling it

371
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,640
something new

372
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,960
right we've we've missed the value the

373
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
the the the change that we're trying to

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,159
try to get to

375
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,000
so hopefully um anna and i um

376
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,360
spent a bunch of time coming up with

377
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,799
this uh workshop for us these exercises

378
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,200
um so hopefully we'll be able to to to

379
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,039
iron out some of these ideas uh but

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
we'll we'll we'll see

381
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,520
okay uh that's that's gonna be

382
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,159
interesting so what what we have

383
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,240
is we have um a couple of exercises to

384
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,520
do around

385
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,799
getting us a little bit more solid on

386
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,880
what

387
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,960
what the commitments are

388
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
and where they fit

389
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,559
in that story

390
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,880
okay in the in the well i i use that

391
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,760
word quite a lot i i i use the word

392
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,880
story uh when sometimes i might mean

393
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,600
rule book right uh but all stories are

394
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,400
based on rules

395
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,120
right

396
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,760
you any novel any movie has a has a

397
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,000
formula within which it operates and the

398
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,400
story is the empathy that's built up

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
around it and i think the same is true

400
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,200
in any process within your organization

401
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,640
if you want people to follow it

402
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,320
they need to connect to that story

403
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,760
in a way that matters to them otherwise

404
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,600
they'll be like i don't care about this

405
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,880
crap and figure out a way around it

406
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,799
which is

407
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,640
like every security policy and every

408
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,640
company i've ever worked with

409
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,159
uh is somebody trying to figure out a

410
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,640
way around it

411
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,320
um so in this particular exercise we're

412
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
going to do we're going to do a little

413
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,039
a little a card sort

414
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,480
okay um so is everybody managed to get

415
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,480
onto the mural i can see there are six

416
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,520
people on the mural so uh

417
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,360
i think there's a couple of people

418
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,400
popped in after

419
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,960
i added to the mural so let me

420
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,960
just paste the link in

421
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,159
that is perfect so i'm just adding it to

422
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,880
the chat

423
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,640
if you can't see the chat for some kind

424
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,600
of company corporate security uh reason

425
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,280
then it did add it to the community site

426
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,720
so if you go to community

427
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,240
dot nkd agility dot com or just go to

428
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,799
nkdlc.com and click on committees

429
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
um you'll get to the the free workshop

430
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
and in there i've put the mural as well

431
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,840
so if i can't directly message it to you

432
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,840
i've stuck it in there

433
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
so hopefully that will bring a couple

434
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,480
more a couple more people in because

435
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,159
what we are going to do

436
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,559
is something called a card sort so if i

437
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,840
zoom into one of these areas just one of

438
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,440
these rooms

439
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,120
and we have uh um

440
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,520
three areas

441
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,039
for each of the commitments

442
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,919
in scrum

443
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,840
okay

444
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,440
so the product goal the sprint goal and

445
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,200
definition done

446
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,840
are the commitments

447
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,480
but i'd like you to sort these cards

448
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,559
here into which commitment do they

449
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,360
belong to

450
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,600
okay

451
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,039
and and uh

452
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,400
this should

453
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,760
um help us get a handle on how these

454
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
things are constructed and maybe a

455
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,799
little bit

456
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,440
maybe not necessarily why they matter

457
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,919
but how they matter right how do they

458
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,440
work how do they relate to each other

459
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,080
um

460
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,080
does anybody not understand the exercise

461
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,320
that's always a good sign

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,360
people are peace no wait we just need to

463
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,640
put the cards in the right place yep

464
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,159
under the right heading i think it's the

465
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,279
right place yep

466
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:13,360
that's uh perfect so let me uh i want

467
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,360
groups of about three so let me see

468
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
all right so

469
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,760
it's okay not to have somebody was

470
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
saying that their teams was crashing

471
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,960
because of the background effect um i'm

472
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,360
not using a background effect either

473
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,320
that is real uh same as uh brandon's

474
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,159
books and anna's bookshelf as well um we

475
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,880
are using real backgrounds and that's

476
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,720
okay too right we're we're definitely

477
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,600
not going to be offended if you have

478
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,480
something weird in the background um

479
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,400
but you know within within reason

480
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,559
you know that that's

481
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,960
how we do that so i've read three rooms

482
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,440
when you go into the room at the top of

483
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,520
your room the title of the bar well at

484
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,880
least in windows i don't know about mac

485
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,440
i would be able to uh um let me know if

486
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,480
that is true and talking and now let me

487
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,520
fix my breakout room fan angle

488
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,600
uh so where did anna end up there

489
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,600
let's do that and then room one has an

490
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
extra person so moved into there we go

491
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,120
right so that'll fix that

492
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
um

493
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,039
so the title bar of the window that pops

494
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,400
up will tell you what room you're in if

495
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,679
you're on windows if you're on mac i

496
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,440
don't know where it is it'll be around

497
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,960
somewhere hopefully somebody somebody

498
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,080
else in the room can say we're in this

499
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
room

500
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,919
and just go to the box that represents

501
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,320
that that room they are color coded to

502
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,080
help us help us find it and start these

503
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,400
cards i will give you five minutes to

504
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,400
sort the cards and carla that is not

505
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,279
going to be enough time

506
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,799
okay to sort all the cards

507
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,200
um but you're gonna have five minutes

508
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,200
and then at the end of the five minutes

509
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,200
over on the right i have the answers

510
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
okay and they're hidden behind this

511
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,240
locked panel

512
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,080
on the right hand side so i'll just

513
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
summon everybody we get 11 now in the

514
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
mural that's pretty good so it's a

515
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,880
locked panel over here and i'm going to

516
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,400
unlock and remove that at the end of the

517
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,919
first five minutes

518
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,000
but i'm going to give you three

519
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,480
additional minutes in the room

520
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,039
just to relate

521
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,480
what's in there with what you put as

522
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,200
well because maybe

523
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,480
maybe you picked uh um

524
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
things and thought that they were in a

525
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,480
different place and the wording

526
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,840
will help us help us get there does that

527
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,120
make sense so you'll get the answers

528
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,440
after five minutes but you'll get an

529
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,039
extra three minutes to review

530
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,039
that was maybe a better way to say it

531
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,559
so if nobody has any uh questions i have

532
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,799
clicked the open rooms button and you

533
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,440
should have like a 10 second warning pop

534
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,039
up

535
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,880
um

536
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,159
yeah just a little thing drops down from

537
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
the top and says you're moving to a

538
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
breakout room in 10 seconds

539
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,880
um

540
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,880
it would be better if it was

541
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
instantaneous but it's kind of nice to

542
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,840
have a 10 second where everybody's gone

543
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
there we go

544
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,240
yeah i so all all the other trainers are

545
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,159
complaining about the 10 seconds that it

546
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,000
takes to get into the breakout room but

547
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,919
i think if

548
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,840
i take it as an opportunity to either

549
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
repeat the exercise

550
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
or

551
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,840
i don't know

552
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
hello

553
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,039

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,200
open you can let me know and i will

570
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,720
uh

571
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,480
bring you into

572
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,360
put you in a breakout room with some

573
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,360
friendly folks

574
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,320
yes sure you i follow the links uh in

575
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,919
the chat not only in the chat okay oh

576
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,679
yeah i'm here right now okay you're on

577
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,080
the mural

578
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,559
yeah perfect so i'm gonna pop up and ask

579
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,240
to be followed for you so you can see

580
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,840
where we are you should get a pop-up on

581
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,799
mural that says follow martin

582
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,640
yes

583
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,399
yep yep so now you're looking at the

584
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,360
same thing as me we've got this exercise

585
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,760
where we're doing we're doing something

586
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,279
called a card sort i want to catch you

587
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,039
up before i send you in so you're not

588
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,960
distracting everybody

589
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,200
and what what we're doing is we have the

590
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,320
we have a a heading

591
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,320
with each of the three commitments

592
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,399
in scrum so the product goal the sprint

593
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,559
goal and definition of done and they're

594
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,960
sorting the cards

595
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,360
under the correct heading

596
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
okay okay does that make sense

597
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,799
yeah cool so i'm going to assign you to

598
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,480
a room

599
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,480
uh pick a number between one and three

600
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,799
i put you in room three so you should uh

601
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,159
disappear in a few seconds off to

602
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,840
off to room three um and

603
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,559
yeah so i'll see you back

604
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,000
in uh three four five six minutes

605
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,480
see six more minutes yeah

606
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
there we go

607
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,640
so teams has no problem with peop more

608
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,360
people arriving

609
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,039
it's when people leave

610
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,520
when you're trying to do breakout room

611
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,600
sessions that's when it struggles

612
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,200
because i think we lost

613
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,880
did we lose the the girl that was here

614
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,399
at the start i don't remember her name

615
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,240
she was here for the first exercise and

616
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
then i think she either disappeared or

617
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
turned her camera off and we haven't

618
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
seen her again but

619
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
it could be either

620
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
it could be a connection

621
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,240
thing that's okay too

622
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,880
room three

623
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,880
needs some help

624
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,360
so rooms one and two are doing okay

625
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
um

626
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,240
room one's doing pretty awesome

627
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
up now they're starting to move them

628
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,720
yeah yeah

629
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,120
is that the the the the girl i can't

630
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,960
have her name girl with the scrum guide

631
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,559
um

632
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,840
right yeah because i don't see her now

633
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,640
in the

634
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,360
in the in the list but um

635
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,720
uh all because all of these cards

636
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,559
are actually just straight out of the

637
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,720
scrum guide i did have to tweak the

638
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,960
wording a little bit on occasion just to

639
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,799
remove the answer

640
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,640
because sometimes the answers in the in

641
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,480
the in the words

642
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,480
and shorten it a little bit but um

643
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
i guess the the purpose

644
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,679
so also for the for the for the folks

645
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
watching who are bored who are stuck

646
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,760
with us

647
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,120
right because they don't get to go to

648
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,279
the breakout rooms

649
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,760
yeah hey everybody um

650
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,480
the purpose of this exercise is to start

651
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,880
getting people to understand

652
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,760
the difference between the different uh

653
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,399
um commitments what they are and what it

654
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,039
says in the scrum guide and so all i did

655
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,960
was i created 16 boxes

656
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,240
and then i went through the text for

657
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,919
each of the commitments in the scrum

658
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,320
guide and every time i came to something

659
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,919
that i could copy out and paste in here

660
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,960
um i did that

661
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,799
so really this is this is them reading

662
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
the scrum guide

663
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,320
uh

664
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,480
in regards to the commitments but in a

665
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,399
card sort kind of way so it feels a

666
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,240
little bit more like a game it feels

667
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,240
less about the reading but because

668
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,919
you've got to make a decision about

669
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,200
which column they go under and then you

670
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
have to have a conversation because

671
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,799
there's more than two people in the room

672
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,120
then uh hopefully uh uh they learn and

673
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,240
figure out stuff and then we can have

674
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,880
when they come back or um

675
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,360
we'll do the self-correcting thing

676
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,039
uh so oh yeah i guess the

677
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,519
self-correcting part just means that

678
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,799
there's a there's an answer sheet which

679
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
i'm going to uncover that's all

680
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,120
self-correcting means

681
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,440
in 20 seconds yeah

682
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,440
um

683
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,519
visiting pandas following me that's

684
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,799
probably not the best idea

685
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,799
following martin's not the best idea

686
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,360
oh i think

687
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,519
i think it might be getting harder as we

688
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,840
get further down the list

689
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,880
they're actually just random so oh there

690
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,960
we go let me open up the answers

691
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,000
uh

692
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
we need class uh well russia has this

693
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,399
problem

694
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,279
and i'm pretty sure she's going to check

695
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,360
it

696
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,120
um but if all the rest have the sperm

697
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,120
guide open they would be able

698
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,320
yeah all of these if you if you open up

699
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,159
the scrum guide or you've got it on

700
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,519
another screen all of these

701
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,960
are super easy you would just have to

702
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,840
find the text

703
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,600
um

704
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
and in fact i think

705
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,919
the way i did it was i created the grid

706
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,600
of 16 boxes and then i just added them

707
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,440
in stripes so they were kind of

708
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,679
randomized um

709
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,840
but not really random there is a pattern

710
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,760
so you can you can and then i numbered

711
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,799
them right so you can probably figure

712
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,799
them out if you know the pattern

713
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
all right let's check on room three what

714
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,240
have they got in

715
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,840
oh are they struggling with things going

716
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,640
behind no they're not they're

717
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
no no

718
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,039
room one is doing pretty good

719
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,320
i wonder if they remembered that the

720
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,320
answers have been uncovered

721
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,200
probably not

722
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,279
i don't see anybody's cursor heading

723
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,480
over to the

724
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,480
heading over to the answers

725
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,519
can we

726
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,519
have something nearer

727
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,440
i did a teams broadcast so teams has a

728
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,280
little mic megaphone button

729
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,280
um that just sends a message to all the

730
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,599
rooms

731
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,599
um

732
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,760
well

733
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,399
done

734
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,399
did they get it right

735
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,480
we'll need to tell them about the bug

736
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,919
and mural

737
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,520
when they come back because i think a

738
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,720
couple of things have suffered from that

739
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,720
that they've kind of dropped

740
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,960
because they're all in front for us

741
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,160
oh no i get one that's behind but it's

742
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,480
because i moved it a little bit

743
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,480
um

744
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,839
i think room one god is stepped

745
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,720
somewhere like they're

746
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,720
arguing about something

747
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,240
uh do you want to pop in and well

748
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
there's only like 15 seconds left

749
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,920
sometimes these exercises are a little

750
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,760
bit easier in in real rooms like

751
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,119
physical rooms because you can hear

752
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,320
everybody and when they get stuck you

753
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,320
can just go over and help them

754
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,640
there is a tool we can experiment with

755
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,960
one time anna that has uh we have little

756
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,480
circles on a map and you move them

757
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,119
closer to different groups of people and

758
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,119
it gets louder

759
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,400
that would be pretty cool to try but

760
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,880
i've clicked to bring everybody back so

761
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,880
they'll be on their way

762
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,720
hello i think i think

763
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,599
uh carla your group got stuck were you

764
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,359
arguing about something

765
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,480
no no no okay

766
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,920
we were just observing and we felt like

767
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,440
uh uh

768
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
got a little bit a little bit bogged

769
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
down

770
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,800
just in moving the cards maybe something

771
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,800
was too contentious

772
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
yeah he was looking at the what we have

773
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,760
written and i was looking at the answers

774
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,000
because the screen moving back and forth

775
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,000
it was too time consuming so he was

776
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,079
saying what we put i was reviewing yes

777
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,720
we got it right and we got everything

778
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,119
right what we put and we even had like

779
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,839
15 seconds left from the sprint to spare

780
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
awesome

781
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,720
i don't know if we will have questions

782
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,079
about this because we did have a one

783
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,680
question

784
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,359
and that

785
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,119
i just uh let me let me hear from the

786
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,480
other rooms first and then we'll we'll

787
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,920
we'll do that

788
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,880
so

789
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,440
room two was brandon erica and anna how

790
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,440
did you get on

791
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,680
yes we actually got through pretty much

792
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,599
all the cards and uh with mostly

793
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,599
agreement

794
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,400
awesome well that's good

795
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,400
any contentious

796
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,040
items

797
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,760
we just are contentious

798
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,119
so we have doing

799
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,240
groups we are not sure

800
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,240
um

801
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,680
i think we

802
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,359
we had a

803
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,800
very short discussion because we didn't

804
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,599
have the time to

805
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,079
to talk about that properly about the

806
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,520
number four might be fulfilled or

807
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,640
abandoned before a new one is created

808
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,880
and i

809
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,160
was thinking about the product goal

810
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,320
uh and the management was any more about

811
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,640
the spring goal so we we talked about

812
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,640
that because it wasn't

813
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,640
very

814
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
i think it was the only

815
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,359
not disagreement but

816
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,400
the only the only point we had the

817
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,400
a discussion and we were not completely

818
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
sure about the twelve

819
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,240
also uh so

820
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,520
uh you can see

821
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,400
these two

822
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,760
uh sentences in the middle of the

823
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
between two

824
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,400
two commitments because we're we're not

825
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,960
sure yeah i i yep i uh and i understand

826
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,960
i can definitely understand why 12 sits

827
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,040
uh between those two things so

828
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
uh we can definitely come back to that

829
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,000
and then in room three it was

830
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
um

831
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,599
dimitrios and andre how did you get on

832
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,119
just focus there

833
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,839
anna and i discussed that before you got

834
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,640
back um there is a their mural

835
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,280
is having a problem right now

836
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,240
and that's sometimes when you drag you

837
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,880
drag something so this is just for you

838
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,800
and drop it it goes behind the thing you

839
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,599
dropped it on

840
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,960
and it's not actually behind it it's

841
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,119
just in your render of it so if you

842
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,240
refresh the browser it's back on top

843
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,400
again

844
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,160
or one of your colleagues can move it

845
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,320
but then for them it will be behind and

846
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,680
for you it will be in front it's very

847
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,040
annoying

848
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,079
uh i i've raised it with with uh mural

849
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,079
support

850
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,480
uh but they're not replying to anything

851
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,000
just now so i assume

852
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,160
because they're usually pretty good at

853
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,079
replying that means there's lots of

854
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,320
people at the mural office running about

855
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,200
with their hair on fire trying to fix it

856
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,440
that's that's that's my my assumption

857
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,280
uh uh based on that either they're not

858
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,599
out of bed yet because they're in pst

859
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,760
time zone and they're just getting up to

860
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,079
to that um but for me it's been like

861
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,480
that since monday i had that problem on

862
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,200
monday in a class so uh we'll see

863
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,560
because i've got it last on next monday

864
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,560
so hopefully they'll fix it

865
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,669
the sticky situation there i

866
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,669
[Music]

867
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,880
my opinion is number four should be our

868
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,200
spreading goal because you must be

869
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,240
fulfilled or abandoned before new y is

870
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,599
created

871
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,200
ah

872
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,319
yeah so

873
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,599
so only uh yeah i also mentioned that uh

874
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,240
only under the certain extreme situation

875
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,040
the spreading goal could be abandoned

876
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,760
that brings my uh fading that this one

877
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,839
should fade uh under the sprinkle

878
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,079
so i'm go i'm going to let you in on a

879
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,760
little secret

880
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:14,560
every single one of these uh post-its is

881
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,560
copied verbatim out of the scrum guide

882
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,880
okay which one question which was chrome

883
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,960
guy the update from 2020 the 2020 scrap

884
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,839
guide i did it this morning

885
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,920
yeah

886
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,079
because you know what the the one

887
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,640
question so i i agree that it's like

888
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,440
really copy it but there was this one

889
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,760
created during the spring climbing event

890
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,240
and this is what i mentioned in the

891
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,480
before the update it did say the scrum

892
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,119
guide if i remember correctly that the

893
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,760
in the part one meeting

894
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,640
this protoner informs about the supreme

895
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,800
goal

896
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,800
the spring gold so

897
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,760
meaning that it's already

898
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,480
so it's actually it's actually been

899
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,920
three versions of the scrum guide since

900
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,720
it had the part one part two

901
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,440
thing

902
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,319
yeah yeah yeah so but that's okay right

903
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,640
um so so

904
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,680
yeah i i and there's a there's a lot of

905
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,560
things

906
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,880
at the that that

907
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,359
so although the words

908
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,359
in the scrum guide has changed

909
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,119
the intent

910
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,160
that the authors had

911
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,880
has not necessarily changed right

912
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,880
but

913
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,880
people's interpretation of the words

914
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,119
means that they then go back and change

915
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,480
the words to try and

916
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,040
not have

917
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,200
incorrect interpretations

918
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,680
so sometimes we read it and we like the

919
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,200
way it was worded like um there's a few

920
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,760
things from the previous verses scrum

921
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,839
guide that i feel feel feel loss

922
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,760
that it's no longer in the scrum guide

923
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,599
and no longer says that

924
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,640
um but it doesn't mean it's not true

925
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,560
right you should be able to take the

926
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,920
intent from any of the versions of the

927
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,119
scrum guide and it's it's the same thing

928
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,599
we're just adding more value adding more

929
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,800
conciseness because the difficulty with

930
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,240
the scrum guide is it uses one word when

931
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,160
it would be better to use a hundred

932
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,400
words

933
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,440
right it's very compacted to keep it

934
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,760
small

935
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,359
um and and try and be a little bit

936
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,800
nimble but it means that there's a lot

937
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,480
of interpretation

938
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,480
a lot of interpretation

939
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,480
um

940
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,330
[Music]

941
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,000
but after your explanation i changed my

942
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,440
mind to more than number four under the

943
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,240
productive goal

944
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,160
yeah

945
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,240
must be fulfilled or abandoned before

946
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,040
the new one is created

947
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,440
it's

948
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,240
yeah before a new one is created is is a

949
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,040
characteristic of the product goal

950
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,359
you wouldn't normally abandon a sprint

951
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,680
goal for sure right

952
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,040
you might cancel a sprint but that's a

953
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,200
lot bigger

954
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,280
cancelling a sprint is a lot bigger more

955
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,000
expensive thing

956
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,240
than just getting to the sprint review

957
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
looking at the product goal and saying

958
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,480
we need a new one of those

959
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,440
right because we're either already there

960
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,839
or the world has changed and it's no

961
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,440
longer relevant

962
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,800
right because we're not actually doing

963
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,160
work inside of the product goal

964
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,560
but we are doing work inside of the

965
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,560
sprint goal so we might be mid sprint

966
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,480
when something nasty happens

967
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,560
um any other any what was the other

968
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,200
contentious ones carla you said that

969
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,280
there was something

970
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,280
still and i still have that one the one

971
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,680
about credit created during the spring

972
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,880
planning event the spring goal

973
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,160
because this how i see it and of course

974
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,720
actually mistaken is that it's a kind of

975
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
a vision where are we looking as a team

976
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,359
where do we want to go and that will

977
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,560
support us really to make decisions

978
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,800
right yep but um kind of created during

979
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,000
the stream planning event

980
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,160
to me is like okay we have already done

981
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,240
the planning so how does this look like

982
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,960
let's make a summary out of it i'm not

983
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,400
sure if i'm really convinced that the

984
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,640
goal would be

985
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,520
as part of the stream planning rather

986
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,359
than

987
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,319
you know product owner communicating

988
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,640
what what what is the kind of vision for

989
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,160
this what how the implement will look

990
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,960
like for example

991
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,240
and now because obviously i haven't read

992
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,040
the 2020 guide that's okay any other

993
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,800
uh i now i'm even confused then who's

994
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,040
creating because since the spring

995
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,800
planning is everyone there

996
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,880
so it's not really only the product

997
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,200
owner saying this is my vision but it's

998
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,839
everyone which makes sense of course

999
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,680
but i don't know i'm more like pro conor

1000
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:58,720
what is your wishes or my commands ah

1001
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,520
you're you're in the benevolent dictator

1002
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,400
uh for the product owner that's okay

1003
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,800
um i i think

1004
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,920
i think i think that that conversation

1005
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,480
between

1006
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,079
the product owner and the team to come

1007
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,960
to an agreement on what the goal is

1008
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,040
is

1009
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,079
part of it is because

1010
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,000
who owns the sprint goal who commits to

1011
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,000
the sprint goal

1012
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,119
during the sprint

1013
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
the the the developers right

1014
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,720
so if if if somebody else makes a

1015
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,440
commitment on your behalf like the

1016
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,599
product owner comes and said carla you

1017
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,640
have to do this and it's an impossible

1018
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,240
task

1019
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,480
and that person doesn't believe it's an

1020
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,280
impossible task but you know it to be

1021
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,040
because you're the technical expert

1022
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,960
then you're in a bit of a position

1023
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,480
aren't you that's not going to make you

1024
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,480
unhappy it's going to make your life

1025
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,480
difficult

1026
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,680
so that the agreement is to reflect

1027
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,359
the realities of doing the work

1028
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,960
so that the developers can say to the

1029
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,160
product owner

1030
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,000
we can't we cannot do that just now

1031
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,520
we need to do a bunch of other stuff

1032
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,359
first before we can get to that or we

1033
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,000
don't have the information or

1034
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,240
understanding we need yet

1035
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,079
right maybe we need to do more research

1036
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,119
maybe we need some training maybe we

1037
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,720
need to speak to a bunch of customers in

1038
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,079
order to get that so that's something

1039
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,480
that might not be able to be done this

1040
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
sprint

1041
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:36,000
what you just said about there is a one

1042
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,000
word when they could use much more for

1043
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,559
example i am referring yeah i'm

1044
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,480
referring here to goal as a vision and

1045
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,480
the vision of the

1046
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,240
of course the protocol from the toner

1047
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,319
and therefore the vision of how i would

1048
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,839
like this increment to look like and

1049
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,160
this is the reason why i have

1050
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,680
prioritized the backlog in this way is

1051
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,920
because this is how i want this

1052
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,800
increment to look like but i'm not

1053
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,280
saying it as an actual commitment that

1054
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,640
yes what what this is this is what we're

1055
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,640
committing to do then is devotion

1056
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,559
i'm going to bring in a diagram to help

1057
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,440
you because

1058
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,680
uh

1059
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,000
i was just teaching a product owner

1060
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,720
class this week

1061
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,920
um and one of the diagrams is i think i

1062
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,160
think they call it they call it the

1063
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,280
planning onion or the organizational

1064
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,119
onion

1065
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,559
i'm i'm i'm being a little bit choppy

1066
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,200
here because i'm opening on a second

1067
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,079
mural and my machine's been difficult

1068
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,240
today

1069
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,599
uh so if i just go in and grab this i'm

1070
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,440
waiting for it to load so then i can

1071
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,480
zoom in to the right place

1072
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,480
there we go i've found it and i need to

1073
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,319
oh no i can just copy it

1074
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,960
and then i'm going to paste it in where

1075
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,200
am i going to stick it let's paste it in

1076
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
here there we go there we go

1077
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,839
so i just stuck it over the top of some

1078
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,839
of this other stuff here

1079
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
so let me let me uh let me summon

1080
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,079
so this is this is i i guess my

1081
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,119
interpretation of that that planning

1082
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,440
onion

1083
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,200
where you've got the different levels of

1084
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,960
the organization on the left so

1085
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,359
delivering validation

1086
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,319
value and solution discovery up to

1087
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,160
product strategy and then product vision

1088
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:18,000
then business strategy and then company

1089
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,359
vision right

1090
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,119
so there might be a lot of different

1091
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,000
products that roll up to that company

1092
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,240
vision

1093
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,319
and then the different levels of goals

1094
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,000
you've got tactical goals for things

1095
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,480
we're doing now

1096
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,079
and then strategic goals for thing that

1097
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,400
that thing you're talking about carla

1098
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,839
that vision is a strategic goal right

1099
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,040
what are we strategically trying to

1100
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,359
achieve

1101
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,720
but sometimes

1102
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,720
that strategic goal

1103
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,480
is too far away

1104
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,640
too far away from the work we're doing

1105
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,200
so we as potentially people doing the

1106
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,200
work are like i've got no idea how what

1107
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,359
i'm doing today relates

1108
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,760
relates to our strategy so i don't feel

1109
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,440
connected empathetically to the product

1110
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,880
and to the vision and what it is we're

1111
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,839
trying to achieve

1112
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,559
and so the product goal

1113
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,040
is meant to be an intermediate strategic

1114
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,319
goal that helps the people doing the

1115
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:17,359
work and the stakeholders right connect

1116
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:19,200
to where are we going just now

1117
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,040
not where are we going you know where

1118
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,079
our end trip is

1119
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,400
um but what what's our next leg

1120
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,520
of our of our of our trip the next

1121
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,680
segment

1122
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,319
of our of our trip and we might have a

1123
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,319
number of sprint goals which are our

1124
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:36,960
tactical goals

1125
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:38,880
um and i actually i like the

1126
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,680
tactical strategic

1127
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,440
wording and i like to i actually maybe

1128
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,839
i'm a bit weird and played too much call

1129
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,079
of duty right but i like to think of it

1130
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,520
like a battlefield

1131
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,800
right you're tr you're trying to you're

1132
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,359
trying to you're trying to you're trying

1133
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,920
to win win win the war

1134
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,880
right is your your end goal

1135
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,760
but

1136
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,680
win the war doesn't help us understand

1137
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,400
what we need to do just now

1138
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,880
uh so maybe maybe we need to

1139
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,960
destroy this castle right that's the the

1140
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,559
next thing we have to do but in order to

1141
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,800
destroy the castle there's 20

1142
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,400
tactical things that have to happen in

1143
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,599
order to get to the point where that

1144
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,400
happens

1145
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,520
um and the the the sprint goal or those

1146
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,559
tactical

1147
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,440
moves towards our product goal and we

1148
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,599
might get so far down that

1149
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,040
tactical goals we might do three or four

1150
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,760
tactical goals

1151
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,839
sprint goals and then we realize oh

1152
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,040
we we can't get there

1153
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,640
or there's no longer relevant or the sun

1154
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,400
blocker which means

1155
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,880
it doesn't make sense anymore or the

1156
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,400
business has changed or

1157
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,319
and we need to figure out what's next so

1158
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,440
that's where the product go

1159
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:53,280
we have one and then if it then becomes

1160
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,160
no longer relevant we pick another one

1161
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,000
but we only ever have one

1162
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,119
that's the idea so i i think you're

1163
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,240
thinking at a higher level than scrum is

1164
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,680
well

1165
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,319
yeah i mean

1166
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,040
again words right vision like i have a

1167
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,440
vision for today although like

1168
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,160
how do i want the day to look like yes

1169
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,559
and it's not my vision for life so he

1170
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,119
said but then again then coming

1171
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,440
regardless of the word like

1172
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,960
who like i understand the commitment of

1173
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,359
courses by the team

1174
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,160
absolutely no with no no question about

1175
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,960
that

1176
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,280
but then at what point or

1177
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,359
basically what what this is

1178
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,240
teaching me in a way is that it is

1179
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,440
actually the team so the developers who

1180
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,920
are deciding the goal of the sprint

1181
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,400
i the developers have to commit to it

1182
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,720
but they agree to it in combination with

1183
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,480
the product owner and the reason there's

1184
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,720
a that combination

1185
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,200
right is not so we talked about one side

1186
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,720
of the combination which is why why it's

1187
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,400
on the developers

1188
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,520
list of things that they need to to

1189
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,960
connect to

1190
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,960
um but also if we don't build the stuff

1191
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,200
the product owner needs

1192
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,280
to keep their stakeholders happy to keep

1193
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,040
the business happy then maybe we're all

1194
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,240
out of a job because the business will

1195
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,920
just go

1196
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,160
oh the the venture cap the venture

1197
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,280
funding will just disappear gone right

1198
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,200
we're done

1199
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,520
so there's a vested interest in the

1200
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,520
developers

1201
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,520
in helping the product owner achieve

1202
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,319
what they want to achieve

1203
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,480
but then there's also the realities

1204
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:30,400
of the tactical situation of what we

1205
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,559
need to do to get there

1206
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,920
and that's that's that balance

1207
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,160
so create

1208
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,480
this context could mean

1209
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,240
it has been proposed by the donor but as

1210
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,280
it has been discussed during the

1211
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:49,599
planning and it has been agreed and

1212
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,599
that's yes for the facebook yes

1213
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,240
it may also change

1214
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,319
i mean yeah during the negotiation and

1215
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,760
agreement because what martin said maybe

1216
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,040
technology doesn't support you or

1217
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,200
anything

1218
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,960
they created in stream planning created

1219
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,599
it means the combination of these three

1220
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,599
actions yeah yeah the first owner can

1221
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,680
come with an idea

1222
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,319
uh that during that negotiation they

1223
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,480
agreed something else because um

1224
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:17,599
what you committed is something that you

1225
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:20,240
need to have this time control of

1226
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,880
and if the developers don't have that

1227
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,040
kind of ownership of what they are doing

1228
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,040
they

1229
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,280
yeah

1230
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:36,400
yeah exactly i can't sleep now

1231
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,440
why don't we use indiana

1232
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,200
east coast

1233
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,319
what was that dimitri i didn't catch

1234
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,400
that

1235
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,880
why what why did

1236
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,880
you see bm so case closed

1237
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,520
cbm

1238
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,680
ebn ebm oh evidence based management

1239
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,520
yeah yeah yeah

1240
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,520
yeah well

1241
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,280
having evidence to make the decisions is

1242
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,240
always a good idea

1243
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,520
um but evidence can only inform your

1244
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,000
decision

1245
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,440
it doesn't control it because sometimes

1246
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,280
we need to do things that's different

1247
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,280
from the evidence

1248
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,599
right and that could be just to keep

1249
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,040
people happy right and they don't care

1250
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,799
about the evidence but we still need to

1251
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,799
keep them happy

1252
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,440
and also there are some things that that

1253
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:23,920
cannot be measured and you can tell them

1254
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,760
but also those discussions of course

1255
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,480
based on data but

1256
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,480
there is a lot of work in that time

1257
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,440
there's a good reason that anna works

1258
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,839
for a company called empathy

1259
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,839
yeah

1260
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,240
um was there any other um

1261
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,040
[Music]

1262
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,040
things that were

1263
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,640
that anybody wanted to to bring up

1264
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,160
no that's cool

1265
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,040
so i see that somebody just posted the

1266
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,720
the the scrum.orgs ebm

1267
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,480
guide

1268
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,720
in the in the chat

1269
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,319
i i definitely recommend

1270
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,079
reading that as well but carla you've

1271
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,400
the first thing on your list is the 2020

1272
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,200
version of the scrum guide okay

1273
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,200
and that then

1274
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,400
yeah and then go read then go read the

1275
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,359
ebm

1276
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,839
guide

1277
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,760
it's i i think there's a lot of value in

1278
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,880
it and then come to my workshop in in

1279
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,000
next month for uh the professional agile

1280
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,960
leadership with evidence-based

1281
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,520
management yeah that too but where are

1282
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,480
you in uk or i'm in the uk but it's a

1283
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,040
virtual workshop i don't i i don't run

1284
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,799
any impair i run all my classes like

1285
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,599
like this

1286
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,440
because um then i don't

1287
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,559
actually it's not

1288
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,640
right and i'll tell you why

1289
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,280
it's a different kind of fun yes but

1290
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,240
prior to lockdown i was traveling 300

1291
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,160
days a year with 140 flights a year and

1292
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,160
in the last 10 years i've been in 32

1293
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,040
different countries averaging about 16

1294
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,720
countries a year so i prefer this

1295
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,640
because it's less travel

1296
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,480
oh well yeah

1297
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,040
yeah i like it

1298
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,880
i like travel for fun carl but we have

1299
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:18,240
to be in in in five cities in one day

1300
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,319
then then it's not so not so fun not so

1301
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,240
fun yeah yeah

1302
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,680
um

1303
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,400
because

1304
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,079
i'm in argentina now for example but it

1305
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,599
wouldn't be impossible it would be

1306
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:34,079
impossible for me to take part in any

1307
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,400
app absolutely and and

1308
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,280
when i when i when i run it these these

1309
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,799
even

1310
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,359
i mean these these are these free

1311
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:43,920
workshops aside when i run classes those

1312
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,799
people come in from from from

1313
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,680
um

1314
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:51,520
you i call it us time zones right but

1315
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,200
but it's eastern eastern time uh

1316
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,119
i get people from uk from europe from uh

1317
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,960
um singapore all the way through to

1318
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,079
singapore and everybody's in the same

1319
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,160
class

1320
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,839
right so we can learn from each other as

1321
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,000
well and our different cultural

1322
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:08,240
backgrounds inform some of the

1323
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,599
discussions that we have around how

1324
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,839
things are done and i think that helps

1325
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,359
too spreading the knowledge and good

1326
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,839
things and how we approach things

1327
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,839
differently

1328
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,119
so um

1329
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,280
anna

1330
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,359
would you like to

1331
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,640
you knew obviously

1332
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,640
explain the crazy circles

1333
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,200
okay so um

1334
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,599
we're looking here uh commitment is one

1335
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,040
of the some of the values of

1336
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,240
uh office

1337
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,040
okay and basically uh we can see you

1338
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,400
values a lot uh and we really don't know

1339
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,280
what it means

1340
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:51,599
uh but basically what what

1341
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,079
state rights behavior they write how we

1342
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,359
behave how we work with people

1343
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,720
and and one of them is commitment and we

1344
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:03,359
commit to a specific thing um that can

1345
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,319
be good or bad okay but we can make

1346
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:10,880
specific things in the strong guy 2020

1347
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:14,720
we are committing to a specific thing

1348
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:16,000
so here what we want you to do um it's

1349
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,000
um

1350
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,319
you have some circles and you have to

1351
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,599
put the circles into the right way into

1352
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,720
the right place

1353
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:27,760
um you have there's the commitment value

1354
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:29,920
and you have to say what he permits you

1355
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,280
where is where it's embodied and the

1356
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,280
rest of the officer

1357
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:38,319
[Music]

1358
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,480
so there are um

1359
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:42,240
a bunch of circles with question marks

1360
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,079
on them

1361
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,960
okay that are connected into this story

1362
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:49,839
with commitment in the middle uh so the

1363
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,920
first circle out is the largest so there

1364
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,160
are three big circles

1365
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,160
and that will obviously be

1366
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,920
uh it's obvious what they will be right

1367
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,680
as the three commitments

1368
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:04,240
uh but then the next circle out is uh

1369
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,400
how are those things embodied

1370
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,640
right what are they embodied in uh and

1371
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,040
then the next uh circles which there

1372
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,880
might be two or three

1373
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,040
are um how how do we realize that what

1374
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:20,319
what what is that thing

1375
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,520
uh um what's the physical elements of it

1376
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,480
does that make sense like how you would

1377
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,480
break down that thing

1378
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,280
was that a better explanation i think i

1379
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,839
think we needed both in order to figure

1380
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,359
out but carla's still confused

1381
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,040
yeah what is embodied

1382
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:40,440
i don't know anna picked that word

1383
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,440
what's it in spanish

1384
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,829
[Music]

1385
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,000
represented by that's a good one for the

1386
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,680
rest of us who don't speak spanish even

1387
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,440
though i should because my wife's

1388
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,799
mexican but

1389
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:07,680
yeah i'm from mexico

1390
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:11,839
i live in finland though oh well makes

1391
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,839
sense yeah well finland's nice

1392
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,720
my wife's mexican and she lives in

1393
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,520
glasgow so you know

1394
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,480
that makes less sense

1395
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,040
so because it's in you know brexit land

1396
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,960
let's not go there uh

1397
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,640
so i have i have three breakout rooms

1398
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,640
i've randomized them again so we won't

1399
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,799
be with the the same the same people in

1400
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,000
case you met somebody uh that you really

1401
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,040
liked and you wanted to stay with them

1402
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,440
you will be with a different group of

1403
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,319
people and the idea is just to drag

1404
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,559
these circles onto

1405
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,799
the ones that it represents now you'll

1406
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,960
see that two of the lines

1407
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,319
are have the same words on them but one

1408
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,640
of them is a little bit different it

1409
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:52,400
says quality measurements

1410
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,760
to protect

1411
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,599
okay so that's the one that's a little

1412
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,640
bit different so there's only a specific

1413
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,960
thing that goes in was in that line

1414
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,400
we totally on board

1415
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,319
and be confused

1416
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,079
i'll ask that while demetrius is

1417
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:09,359
drinking so he can't say yes and then

1418
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,359
i'll click open rooms and there we go

1419
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,720
no problem

1420
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,720
um so i will i'm going to

1421
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,480
in fact we don't know how long this is

1422
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,000
going to take so i'll probably put eight

1423
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,480
minutes on the timer and then we'll see

1424
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,079
how you get on

1425
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,079
oh i think i added you to a romana

1426
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,440
yes i did add you to a room

1427
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,520
so this is a brand new

1428
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,079
exercise if you're watching i think i

1429
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,760
fixed the echo if you had an echo right

1430
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,280
if you didn't that's okay

1431
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,559
um

1432
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,839
hopefully you could still hear me and

1433
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,520
still hear anna but you could hit

1434
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:53,359
desktop as well and i think i think that

1435
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,359
was confusing so um

1436
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:58,400
and i came up with this it i think it

1437
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,000
looks it looks like it's interesting um

1438
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,640
it probably needs some iterations to get

1439
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,640
it like so we could explain it well

1440
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,160
um but effectively you're just moving

1441
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:09,039
those uh individual circles on top of

1442
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,720
uh

1443
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,240
the the dotted circles with the question

1444
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,319
marks i mean that's pretty much it it's

1445
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,680
filling the fill in the blanks

1446
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,880
exercise

1447
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,280
ah

1448
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,280
anna

1449
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,000
are you back

1450
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,799
yeah

1451
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,640
you you put me in a breaker room i did i

1452
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,000
did

1453
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,359
yeah but that's

1454
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,440
that gave me the

1455
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,039
if they understood it and we explained

1456
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,400
it correctly and they said yes

1457
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,640
completely so

1458
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,720
perfect i i actually figured out when i

1459
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,079
was trying to explain it again to

1460
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,960
everybody else

1461
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,839
um

1462
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,520
i fill in the blanks

1463
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:47,839
is probably

1464
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,680
the easiest shortest

1465
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,319
uh way to say it

1466
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,760
oh so we get number one i think we got

1467
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:56,400
two people

1468
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,400
drop out

1469
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,319
a biddy i think hussein has dropped out

1470
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,039
or i think i'm saying that wrong again

1471
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,280
uh alex looks like he's dropped oh alex

1472
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,960
is a pst oh

1473
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,640
yeah well he joined like five minutes

1474
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,039
from the left or something like that

1475
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,880
okay

1476
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:16,880
so there's only two people in in room

1477
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,799
one and two three people in room two but

1478
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,839
that's okay that's still

1479
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:21,839
that's still a good number

1480
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,119
probably makes it easier

1481
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,000
well

1482
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,440
what i like from this is that you need

1483
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,240
to kind of

1484
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,119
uh build the whole as you say sorry like

1485
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,119
okay i commit to

1486
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,160
the definition of don

1487
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,200
uh

1488
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,079
but it's represented by and so you have

1489
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,880
to do the full thinking process and it

1490
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,880
only goes one way yeah and i the thing i

1491
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,799
liked was the in the definition of done

1492
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,680
one you get to the end and you're like

1493
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:57,200
oh right so these have got to go

1494
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,280
somewhere else and i have to bring these

1495
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,760
other ones over yeah i do like that i do

1496
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,760
like that

1497
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,079
but

1498
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,839
i think it's the

1499
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,720
one

1500
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:16,160
it's the one that it

1501
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,079
was was the sprint goal the two

1502
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,400
i can't remember now

1503
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,599
oh no

1504
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,440
three

1505
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:27,760
yeah the top one vertical

1506
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,760
left

1507
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,520
it was like room one

1508
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:34,520
oh yes

1509
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:45,580
[Music]

1510
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,480
but

1511
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,520
i'll send them a message to

1512
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,240
it can be

1513
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,039
i just sent everybody a message to say

1514
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,240
if things are falling behind other

1515
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,760
things you might need to refresh the

1516
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,119
browser

1517
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,920
there's a couple of weird things happen

1518
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,920
there but that's okay

1519
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:29,760
the technology is never going to be

1520
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,559
perfect every time

1521
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,319
so

1522
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,319
having a little bit of best efforts okay

1523
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:40,799
i i i like what they are

1524
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,720
i like what they are uh

1525
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:44,079
how they are ordering ordering it

1526
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,880
because it's

1527
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,160
um

1528
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:50,079
it's the common way people think about

1529
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,319
this uh

1530
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,200
for example product goal and vote and

1531
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:57,119
voted in product backlash politicality

1532
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:01,839
measures to protect further factual

1533
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:04,160
items order and details yeah

1534
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:06,960
i i like it too

1535
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:10,480
we just need to be able to

1536
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,480
explain it much more easily yeah

1537
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,039
but that's okay

1538
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,480
if they got it so they're doing it

1539
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,000
it works we got we got it we got it

1540
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,960
explained enough

1541
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,400
um

1542
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,400
so we're about

1543
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,119
15 minutes behind

1544
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:31,039
right now but that's okay

1545
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,039
that's much better than i usually are

1546
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:38,079
one last thing with uh on time right the

1547
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,760
yeah the definition of done one yeah we

1548
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,720
got that we got that time box pretty

1549
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,319
great it was the it was the the

1550
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,000
um

1551
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,160
the coin game one that was just a

1552
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,119
complete disaster

1553
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,480
that took

1554
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,240
ages it took so long to explain it

1555
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,240
and then re-explain it and then

1556
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,319
re-explain it and then go help teams

1557
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,559
that were struggling

1558
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,319
you were playing the in the uh you mean

1559
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,960
the kanban one

1560
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:08,000
and uh the penny game yeah

1561
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,559
okay yeah it was it it

1562
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,359
it must have taken us 60 minutes to do

1563
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,559
the 30 minute exercise

1564
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,560
right but that's the trouble with a 30

1565
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:18,159
minute exercise right if things go a

1566
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,440
little bit wrong then it becomes massive

1567
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,319
whereas if you've got lots of smaller

1568
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,480
ones

1569
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,839
maybe you just skip something that is

1570
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,839
that's struggling

1571
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,159
batch size we're doing an exercise on

1572
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,800
batch size and the batch size was too

1573
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:32,719
big

1574
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,199
[Laughter]

1575
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:39,040
i i think that when when i took the

1576
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,040
training uh with recumbent

1577
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,799
um

1578
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,679
i i also grabbed some some ideas and did

1579
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:48,799
a training uh at empathy and

1580
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,799
and they really liked it

1581
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:54,080
but you've done you've done the the pro

1582
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,759
kanban um applying

1583
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,719
professional kanban

1584
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,799
yeah yeah

1585
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:00,159
i i can i can teach that but i haven't

1586
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,560
taught one yet

1587
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,239
i haven't done one yet um because i also

1588
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,960
teach the psk

1589
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:08,799
the professional scrum with kanban um

1590
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,000
which is

1591
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,799
i mean literally the the pk is two whole

1592
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,480
days just on kanban whereas the the

1593
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:20,159
professional scrum with kanban is like

1594
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:23,359
uh what one day on kanban and one day on

1595
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:25,600
scrum with kanban right so well i i just

1596
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,679
felt the full time

1597
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,759
yeah yeah

1598
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,679
i just haven't haven't haven't uh taught

1599
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,080
it yet it looks like uh everybody's

1600
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,080
finished

1601
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,560
no i don't

1602
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,920
well i would have it in my account yeah

1603
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,920
yeah okay okay okay

1604
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,199
i actually i went to look down the

1605
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,880
bottom and they're all the ones that

1606
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,159
we've got down there are blank all of

1607
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,719
the copies we've got at the bottom are

1608
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:07,199
blank yeah but i have it here

1609
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,199
oh cool

1610
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,280
yes

1611
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,960
i'm copying

1612
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,239
it and

1613
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,239
should i add it somewhere

1614
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,280
or once they come back oh

1615
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,760
hold on i think blue team definitely

1616
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,760
have stuff dropping behind

1617
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,880
luckily i made everything see-through so

1618
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,880
you can at least still see it

1619
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,199
yeah the blue team stuff yeah yeah

1620
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,360
they're writing a little message in

1621
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,360
there

1622
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,719
and uh i'm not the things anymore

1623
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,440
i fixed it for them

1624
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,159
and the time is

1625
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,960
over

1626
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,920
it it is it is the eight minutes is over

1627
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,480
i think

1628
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,880
two groups are are are done so i think

1629
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:15,040
we should bring them back and

1630
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,080
we will we will suffer the wrath of team

1631
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,960
two

1632
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,040
um

1633
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,440
who who

1634
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,440
had an impediment

1635
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:34,000
hello

1636
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,000
hello

1637
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,679
hello hello

1638
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,760
that was a perfect way for you guys to

1639
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,880
communicate with us room two thank you

1640
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,880
for that

1641
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,040
because i fixed it as soon as i saw that

1642
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,560
because i was like i can't drag those or

1643
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,239
i was actually looking to see if i could

1644
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,600
move one of them into place and yeah

1645
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,480
things were

1646
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,360
yeah

1647
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,360
so at least do you know what's worse

1648
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,520
i i made all of the backgrounds

1649
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,199
semi-transparent

1650
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,040
so sometimes they drop behind and they

1651
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:04,080
just disappear and you don't know what's

1652
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,280
going on

1653
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,440
um but at least if they're

1654
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,920
semi-transparent you can still see them

1655
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,719
i know it's there but i can't grab it

1656
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:15,600
well so that was a bit better

1657
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,760
uh so sorry sorry about that

1658
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,760
um

1659
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,600
six in the

1660
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:22,640
i guess like 30

1661
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,679
seconds

1662
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,600
yeah

1663
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,520
as soon as i saw the tech i fixed it as

1664
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,159
soon as you sent me a message to fix it

1665
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,400
so but yeah it was a bit late yeah

1666
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,159
sorry about that um

1667
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,560
anna would you like to

1668
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:38,159
to debrief

1669
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,520
yeah well how

1670
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:43,440
did in room one from

1671
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:45,360
the exercise and

1672
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,360
what did you see did you find it

1673
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,360
difficult

1674
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,719
okay do you want to go

1675
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,040
okay

1676
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,679
no not difficult at all we hope because

1677
01:12:55,040 --> 01:13:00,159
we finished in like two minutes and then

1678
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:03,520
we have time to chat a little uh we

1679
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:05,600
found it quite uh quite easy to

1680
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,440
um

1681
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,960
well to the puzzle and

1682
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:15,679
we started we we started uh

1683
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,960
putting the the commitments and then

1684
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,679
then we

1685
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:23,120
we filled the one commitment at the time

1686
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,400
and it was it was very easy so we didn't

1687
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,280
have any any doubt i think

1688
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,159
okay

1689
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,400
so

1690
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:32,719
for every room it was here where we put

1691
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:34,159
everything and so even for room

1692
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:37,120
uh too that

1693
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,159
we're not able to move things

1694
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,520
yeah

1695
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:42,560
um

1696
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:44,800
and the the part that is

1697
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,880
going on in our team is we have

1698
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,719
conversation about

1699
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,600
which one is which

1700
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,600
so i apologize

1701
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,600
we were again

1702
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,080
happiness

1703
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:05,280
because i i took i was taking literally

1704
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:08,000
the the represented by

1705
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:12,000
and for instance definition of done is

1706
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,840
not necessarily represented by increment

1707
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,800
so you know like

1708
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,400
that

1709
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,760
didn't really

1710
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,360
really

1711
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,280
that's what i was just i was just

1712
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,000
talking what is it that lost in

1713
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,000
translation

1714
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,760
yes to be

1715
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,800
yeah i mean

1716
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,360
i i i can i can see the represented by

1717
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,760
but yeah maybe it's a little bit tenuous

1718
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,760
um

1719
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,840
but this will describe in the newspaper

1720
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,760
guide

1721
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:46,320
so the definition of that is with the

1722
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,320
increment

1723
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,480
yeah the so the way the way it's

1724
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,920
described in the the scrum guide and i

1725
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,440
actually think the wording in the scrum

1726
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,000
guide is a little bit weird for this

1727
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:59,440
right but um it says the

1728
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,120
the increment is born

1729
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,360
when the product meets the definition of

1730
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,360
done

1731
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,520
which is a little bit weird because then

1732
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,320
you weird pictures in your head but

1733
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,719
uh

1734
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,719
it it i think it does kind of it does

1735
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,199
kind of work that's the thing

1736
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:17,199
that lets us know whether if if we

1737
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:18,880
didn't meet the definition of done we

1738
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:21,120
don't have an increment

1739
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:21,120
right

1740
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,920
if we meet the definition of done 20

1741
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,120
times during the sprints we have 20

1742
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,280
things that we could ship during the

1743
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,199
sprint if that's what we wanted to do

1744
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,480
um that's the essence of continuous

1745
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,920
delivery

1746
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,280
is that you're meeting your definition

1747
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,840
of done constantly because hopefully

1748
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:40,080
it's automated

1749
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,920
i see and anna brought in the the

1750
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,800
answers grid

1751
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,040
yeah

1752
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,040
so

1753
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,640
so here uh is the solution

1754
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,560
um

1755
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,120
so yes the definition of that is

1756
01:15:54,560 --> 01:16:00,080
embodied in the increment

1757
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,800
uh and it's uh quality measures to

1758
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,040
protect uh customers organizations and

1759
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,679
themes okay so that was the

1760
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:08,560
place to put the definition of them

1761
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,080
um

1762
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:14,320
i've seen uh in some teams uh that the

1763
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,000
uh the product backlog is the quality

1764
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:19,120
measure to protect the current faculty

1765
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,280
items orders and customers and

1766
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,800
i don't know how to

1767
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,280
um

1768
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,560
interpret that

1769
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:30,640
or how you got to that

1770
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,000
idea

1771
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,440
um

1772
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,520
and well first

1773
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,360
it's involved in the product backlog by

1774
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,840
the product battle of items the order

1775
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:42,080
and the detail and the streamed uh goal

1776
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,400
is for the stream backlog and uh

1777
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:48,800
tangible bytes for the backlog items in

1778
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:50,480
the button that's the absolute basically

1779
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,880
anything

1780
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,840
that you don't see clear here

1781
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,239
yes

1782
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,390
so we had a discussion about the product

1783
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,760
backlog in the details

1784
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:00,480
[Music]

1785
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,800
but

1786
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,239
most of the product uh backlog items are

1787
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,960
not details only the most prioritized on

1788
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,040
the top that's why you put the details

1789
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:15,040
in the sprint uh

1790
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:17,840
because there you must have the details

1791
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:19,920
yeah well um the idea put it in is there

1792
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:22,080
i think it's the same that you're you're

1793
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,159
saying uh the

1794
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,920
produce goal is embodied in the product

1795
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:29,199
backlit and those that detail on on top

1796
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,159
of the background

1797
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:35,040
uh it's guiding us to the

1798
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,040
to the pedestal

1799
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,199
the more you're on top of the mirror you

1800
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,719
have uh

1801
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,719
how you're going you're committing

1802
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:49,520
that's how i understand it yeah

1803
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,679
i think uh my team is

1804
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,080
doing the best so all answers are

1805
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,080
correct

1806
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,800
i i do kind of like the the details

1807
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,199
piece as part of product backlog because

1808
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,480
one of the things that that is

1809
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,719
um

1810
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,560
i think much more clear in the new

1811
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,120
version of the scrum guide

1812
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,360
is that refinement is the activity that

1813
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:16,239
adds details

1814
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:18,320
so details about the what not

1815
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,239
necessarily the how but maybe a little

1816
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,920
bit of the how

1817
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,080
right because there's some there's a lot

1818
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,960
of crossover between

1819
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,840
um

1820
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,840
what you want and how you want it done

1821
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,400
and i have a lot of discussions with

1822
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:35,120
product owners about how much detail

1823
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,960
should you go into

1824
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,080
on your product back clock

1825
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,000
and and for things that we need to build

1826
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,199
i.e the stuff that's at the top of our

1827
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,199
product backlog that are candidates

1828
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,920
for bringing into the sprint

1829
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:51,040
we need as much detail

1830
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,360
as the

1831
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,360
team the developers need

1832
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,280
to feel comfortable that they can take

1833
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:59,280
it on and build it

1834
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,199
right so what does that mean within your

1835
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,080
context if you're building something

1836
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:05,600
that is less complex maybe you don't

1837
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,400
need a lot of details

1838
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,560
right

1839
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,560
but for example i've worked with a

1840
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,480
company in norway

1841
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,320
who build maritime simulation software

1842
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,440
so it's used

1843
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,800
with full rigs with rooms that pivot

1844
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,760
around to simulate the sea to train

1845
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,719
people

1846
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,480
uh

1847
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,640
to to handle massive ships at sea right

1848
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,640
and do all sorts of crazy things like

1849
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:36,000
maybe you've got a storm and you need to

1850
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:37,600
offload cargo from one ship to another

1851
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,679
in the middle of the sea it's not a good

1852
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,120
idea right it's not a good idea to do

1853
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,320
that but there are circumstances where

1854
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,199
you might have to

1855
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,440
but the complexity of that software

1856
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,120
and the complexity of the task at hand

1857
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:51,120
because it has to work

1858
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,480
it's effectively a simulation of the

1859
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,239
real world

1860
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,320
it's the simulation of real world

1861
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:59,199
physics and one of the things they have

1862
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:02,080
to have and this is just one piece right

1863
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:05,360
is there's three months work

1864
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:08,880
goes into the spreadsheet that you need

1865
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:11,520
to understand how the hull of the ship

1866
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,400
interfaces with the water

1867
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,480
right

1868
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,480
and every single ship is unique

1869
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,440
so you need that up front because you

1870
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,080
can't build

1871
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,360
that feature you can't add that ship to

1872
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:27,600
your product

1873
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:29,760
unless you have that information

1874
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,040
so that's a whole three months worth of

1875
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
detail

1876
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:36,480
that you need somebody with a physics

1877
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:38,400
background in hydrodynamics uh phd and

1878
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,560
hydrodynamics to be able to to be able

1879
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,639
to build for you um so that's a that's

1880
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,239
quite a lot of detail right

1881
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,320
um but one of the things that we talk

1882
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,080
about a lot in agile that is

1883
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,040
misinterpreted

1884
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,080
is that oh we don't need

1885
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,000
to do

1886
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,840
lots of stuff up front

1887
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,840
right or we shouldn't be doing lots of

1888
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,679
stuff up front and that's kind of a

1889
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,480
fallacy right

1890
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:05,920
what we are saying is you shouldn't do

1891
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,920
more than you have to

1892
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,880
how much do you need to do enough up

1893
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:13,120
front just enough

1894
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,600
so that when your team walks into sprint

1895
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,880
planning they have everything they need

1896
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,480
the knowledge they need the

1897
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,840
understanding they need and the data

1898
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,400
they need to build the thing that you

1899
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,400
want them to build

1900
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,719
right so that might be a lot in your

1901
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,480
circumstances i hoping the team that

1902
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:32,159
builds planes at boeing has lots of

1903
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,320
information at their disposal at that

1904
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,120
point but if we're building a marketing

1905
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:41,239
website for a small company

1906
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,239
maybe we don't need so much information

1907
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,560
i don't know if that helped or it was

1908
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,560
just a rant

1909
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,800
could have been either

1910
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,480
okay thank you

1911
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,280
yeah i think uh

1912
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,400
uh we needed to change that details from

1913
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,560
uh

1914
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,040
spring battle over to the product

1915
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,040
backlog

1916
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,840
if uh

1917
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,320
i understand what it is then correct and

1918
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:11,360
so also based on the

1919
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:12,800
the scrum guide so it's ongoing activity

1920
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,960
to add a details

1921
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,560
yep

1922
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,159
yep okay

1923
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,840
um and that

1924
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:21,840
the scrum guide is a good reference to

1925
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,800
go back to for that i mean it's it's

1926
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,400
it's

1927
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,840
not the be all and end all you've got to

1928
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,480
be pragmatic

1929
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,920
um as well but sometimes you need to be

1930
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,360
a little bit dogmatic to try and

1931
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,440
understand what people are getting at we

1932
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,480
want to all be playing the same game

1933
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,480
um

1934
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:39,040
and if everybody understands something

1935
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,199
in the same way uh like having that

1936
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:45,040
conversation like we're talking about

1937
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:46,719
when carla was confused uh with that

1938
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:49,040
particular terminology but we can have a

1939
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,040
conversation about it we can agree as a

1940
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,960
group well this is what we mean by that

1941
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,199
okay now i understand that this word in

1942
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,080
this case means this now we're all on

1943
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,679
the same

1944
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,840
the same understanding but we need to

1945
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,440
come to those agreements because

1946
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,600
how many different cultures are

1947
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,120
represented here in this

1948
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,800
uh meeting different people with

1949
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,679
different language backgrounds people

1950
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,320
with different uh upbringings

1951
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:14,239
i find even if you took somebody

1952
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,639
from the west end of who went to school

1953
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,080
in the west end of glasgow and somebody

1954
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,159
who went to school in the east end of

1955
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,560
glasgow they will have a different

1956
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,080
outlook on language a different outlook

1957
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,320
on how to say things how to phrase

1958
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,840
things and what they mean right

1959
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,719
uh and that's

1960
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,800
within 10 miles of each other let alone

1961
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,480
the thousands of miles there are between

1962
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,560
all of us

1963
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,760
right and what about your team members

1964
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,520
where are they from what are their

1965
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,280
backgrounds did they all go to the same

1966
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,159
school and sit in the same classes with

1967
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,080
the same teacher no they didn't

1968
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:49,040
right and every teacher brings their own

1969
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:51,040
story to the puzzle as well

1970
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,520
so i think it it's just

1971
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:56,000
definitely these common understandings

1972
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,639
and workshops like this can help bring

1973
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,199
out some of those things those nuggets

1974
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,040
that that people are confused about or

1975
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:05,920
have different stories for so that you

1976
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,360
can come to an agreement

1977
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,360
about what you mean and what it says

1978
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,280
working agreements are really important

1979
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,000
excuse something a little bit related to

1980
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:20,719
that we have a similar discussion

1981
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,719
to this uh in my team and and half of

1982
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:27,120
them are coming from

1983
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:28,960
uh de la rose and the other half it's

1984
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,360
uh chile molly

1985
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,600
right so like very mixed

1986
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,920
and uh and there was a conversation

1987
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,719
about one of the

1988
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:41,440
actually from the jargon from scrum

1989
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:44,400
now i can't remember what was ah yeah

1990
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:47,120
they are using jira right and they call

1991
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,920
the pbis they call yeah

1992
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:52,320
they come and they call yeah and they

1993
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,400
call them tickets and it drives me crazy

1994
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,920
and then at the end i was like no they

1995
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,600
were like challenging me yeah but it

1996
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,840
doesn't matter what you call them in the

1997
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,040
end you're going to work on them

1998
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:02,320
yeah and

1999
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:05,360
and i

2000
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,960
while i agree in principle

2001
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,800
with what they're saying that it doesn't

2002
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,400
matter what you call them

2003
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,600
right um

2004
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:15,760
lots one of the reasons that scrum uses

2005
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,080
different terminology

2006
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:19,760
from the stuff that came before is to

2007
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:22,400
avoid the baggage

2008
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,520
of the thing that came before so it does

2009
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,880
matter

2010
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,400
at what what what what you call them and

2011
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,600
yeah i mean

2012
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:34,239
so many people call call what you work

2013
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,920
on in skrama user story

2014
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,320
but the word user story is never

2015
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,120
mentioned in the scrum guide

2016
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,239
yeah

2017
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:44,719
so so it's it it's a choice it might be

2018
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:46,159
a good choice for your team

2019
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:48,800
right but it also might be the wrong

2020
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:52,239
choice i've i work with teams who build

2021
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,840
apis and data frameworks

2022
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,239
and they're trying to fit everything

2023
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,960
into a user story and it makes no sense

2024
01:25:56,239 --> 01:26:00,560
whatsoever they've all these

2025
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,600
ridiculously contrived

2026
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,440
ways of writing these these stories

2027
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,440
in order to fit it into that format and

2028
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,960
it doesn't work because it's designed

2029
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:12,639
for users interacting with systems

2030
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:15,920
if a user doesn't interact with your

2031
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,800
system a user story doesn't make sense

2032
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,719
yeah good point yeah but ticket drives

2033
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,639
me crazy because i

2034
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,960
decide to serve his management strong

2035
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:28,080
background so it just drives me crazy to

2036
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,920
do that in any context yeah because

2037
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,719
pick it has a lot of connotations

2038
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,480
requirement has a lot of tasks has a lot

2039
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,080
of connotations for anybody who's ever

2040
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:40,320
worked with a project manager or an ms

2041
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,320
project everything's a task right

2042
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:45,199
so but coming to your point about that

2043
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:48,719
to agree

2044
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:51,520
what if you're agreeing on this kind of

2045
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:54,480
terminology that has not really

2046
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,520
background that i that i then i don't

2047
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,520
mind

2048
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:01,440
as long as

2049
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,960
the agreement is this is what it means

2050
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,760
right we're looking at the scrum guide

2051
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,639
now the scrum guide says sprint

2052
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,639
right

2053
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:11,040
uh we're our automotive company and

2054
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,960
we're going to call it a race

2055
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,120
right because because because that's

2056
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,040
what we want to call it in our in our in

2057
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,280
our company that's cool

2058
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,120
uh it's because it's a scrum team

2059
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:24,800
um or it's a tribe

2060
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:27,199
right i i i don't i don't care it

2061
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,639
doesn't actually matter as long as we're

2062
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:31,280
in agreement

2063
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:33,360
what the accountabilities are what the

2064
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,120
commitments are

2065
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,800
right what the artifacts are to provide

2066
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,199
transparency those are the things that

2067
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,960
we want to want to agree on and i don't

2068
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:42,239
think it really matters what they're

2069
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,199
called

2070
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:46,560
but if

2071
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:48,239
we're here in this context right in our

2072
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:51,679
context here where we're trying to have

2073
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:53,199
a conversation about what does that mean

2074
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,560
you've kind of got to go back to the

2075
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,480
original

2076
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,560
terminology in the scrum guide and what

2077
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:01,120
is it trying to say and why is it trying

2078
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,960
to say it that way but when we go back

2079
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:05,120
to the office we can be pragmatic and

2080
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:07,040
say oh you want to call it a

2081
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:09,440
everybody's not a team member they're a

2082
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,199
technical fellow okay i don't mind what

2083
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,159
what you call people

2084
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,480
right

2085
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:16,880
but if you're a scrum master and your

2086
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,639
job is updating the gantt chart you're

2087
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,080
not a scrum master

2088
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:21,440
yes right you're not you're not

2089
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,800
fulfilling the accountabilities of the

2090
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,199
scrum master

2091
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,199
um if your job is making sure the

2092
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:30,880
developers complete all their tasks in a

2093
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:34,159
sprint right you're not a scrum master

2094
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,000
um so i think terminology is is great to

2095
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,280
have a conversation about

2096
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,280
out with

2097
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,639
the general public if that if that kind

2098
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,239
of makes sense like when we're all

2099
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,000
practitioners

2100
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:46,159
having a conversation about the

2101
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,120
mechanics of what it is we're trying to

2102
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:48,400
do

2103
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,960
be explicit

2104
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,480
right and and and pick on those things

2105
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,040
but when i've got a team

2106
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,679
i'm going to try and guide them towards

2107
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,600
the way i want them to be or way i would

2108
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,760
like them to be regardless of of what

2109
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,920
they call it

2110
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,600
what do you just say so if you're doing

2111
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:09,120
this you're not a scrum master and

2112
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,360
wasn't so scrub master well you step you

2113
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:13,760
kind of coach and keep reminding the

2114
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:17,120
team and so on in a scrum as per the

2115
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:20,239
strong guy so that makes me troubled

2116
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,960
is you know like how much would you

2117
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:25,199
or not but then organizations

2118
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,840
organizations get a get away with it by

2119
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,639
calling them an agile project manager

2120
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:30,320
right

2121
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:33,760
so you're not actually a scrum master

2122
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,760
you're an agile project manager

2123
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:39,199
exactly exactly

2124
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:41,199
well i got to do the profit and loss

2125
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,560
reporting and and do the invoicing to

2126
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,520
the customer and

2127
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,679
uh

2128
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,600
i've got to do the the the product

2129
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,360
productivity report with everybody's

2130
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,400
timekeeping and

2131
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:53,120
yeah

2132
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:54,239
yeah the kpis yeah so

2133
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,840
yeah i think

2134
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,040
i don't mind what people call it just be

2135
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,639
careful

2136
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,320
of of baggage

2137
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,800
baggage getting in the way of the the

2138
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,679
new way of doing things

2139
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:08,159
so i think um we only we only have

2140
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,360
like five minutes left

2141
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,679
because we had to get some good

2142
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:14,320
conversations out of that one um and i

2143
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:16,400
think it's pretty late for for anne is

2144
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:20,000
it pretty late for you

2145
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:21,760
no no it's a prayer

2146
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,480
you're in canada now

2147
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,920
yeah okay so then it's then it's pretty

2148
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,280
early for you

2149
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,400
cool

2150
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,400
um

2151
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,360
so so

2152
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:35,280
i i think we should do

2153
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,960
um a little bit

2154
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,800
will we do a little bit of the conclu

2155
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:41,120
can we do that quickly

2156
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,960
can we do a what so what now what anna

2157
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,000
do you think in like four minutes

2158
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,440
probably not

2159
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,840
i think

2160
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:49,040
we can we can give it a go um we've been

2161
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,960
giving a girl

2162
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:52,719
we all we've got uh we've got an extra

2163
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,040
team member now eric has brought an

2164
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:56,719
extra team member yeah

2166
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,239

2168
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:03,840

2171
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,800
looks like a baby baby that is a very

2172
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,960
observant of you

2173
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,960
looks

2174
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,120
we just can't smell it it probably

2175
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:25,280
smells like a baby too

2176
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:27,840

missing them but i don't know why i did

2181
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,760
it

2182
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:45,080

2187
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:02,000
uh

2188
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:04,239
so let me let me summon

2189
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,760
i think i summoned everybody yes

2190
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:09,600
um so we've got there's three three

2191
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,400
rounds here and we're kind of going

2192
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,080
going to do it just as a as a big uh

2193
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:17,600
group exercise

2194
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:19,520
and i'd like you to to think about in in

2195
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,679
the first round i'll put three minutes

2196
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,760
on the timer uh or two two minutes on

2197
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:26,639
the timer for the first round and i want

2198
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,440
you to think about and add some post-its

2199
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,199
for

2200
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,560
you know what what did you feel half

2201
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:33,600
what happened

2202
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:36,080
uh during this uh workshop what did you

2203
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,480
notice uh what were things that you

2204
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:40,880
observed or stood out for you

2205
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:43,360
um so we'll just focus on on round one

2206
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,520
and i'll put two minutes on the timer

2207
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,280
for you to add some post-its and if you

2208
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,440
aren't able to double-click and add

2209
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:54,120
post-its you can right-click and add a

2210
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:54,120
sticky note that works as well

2211
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,400
hmm

2212
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,880
and i love those two post-its right next

2213
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,880
to each other

2214
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,800
right next to the

2215
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,480
the other one

2216
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,679
different people's interpretations of

2217
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:14,000
the same same activities

2218
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,000
i love

2219
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,040
that yeah that that is something we did

2220
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:23,120
trying to focus on

2221
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,600
stories and how to use stuff rather than

2222
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:27,040
just uh the theory so yeah we did we'd

2223
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:31,159
talk a lot about the scrum guide but

2224
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,159
there was stuff stuff in there

2225
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,960
that is very good

2226
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:40,080
to admit smiley face notice that i was

2227
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,080
wrong for some things

2228
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:43,440
it's

2229
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,239
pretty valuable

2230
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:54,000
uh so let's move on to the so what

2231
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:55,840
we've got two minutes again

2232
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,600
we'll keep the pace clippy

2233
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:02,080
and what patterns or conclusions

2234
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,840
emerged

2235
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,320
why why why are the things we talked

2236
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:08,560
about important and are there any

2237
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:11,360
hypothesis

2238
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,360
that you can make

2239
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,719
relating it back to

2240
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,719
maybe the stuff you do at work

2241
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,760
i like that it's always good to hear

2242
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,800
other opinions

2243
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,119
totally that's that's why these sessions

2244
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,520
are just open sessions because then i

2245
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:06,480
get lots of different opinions

2246
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:10,560
although

2247
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:10,560
i recognize some folks from classes

2248
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,440
in fact both anas anna squared

2249
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,800
is always good so let's look at it now

2250
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,800
what

2251
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,320
what can what can you do what what

2252
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,760
letter what's what's something you

2253
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,360
learned during this experience how could

2254
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,280
you apply it

2255
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,320
in in future

2256
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,679
uh

2257
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,679
iterations

2258
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,760
um

2259
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,159
what you need

2260
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,000
to do in order to improve things next

2261
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:40,239
time what could you what could you

2262
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,920
actually change

2263
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:43,199
in your organization maybe it's

2264
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,280
difficult maybe it's just something you

2265
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:46,960
could change in yourself

2266
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,400
right because it's easy to change the

2267
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,560
things we do it's difficult to change

2268
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,560
other people

2269
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,880
try and avoid when you're not in a

2270
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,800
training situation

2271
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,960
uh telling people but the scrum guide

2272
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,679
says

2273
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,360
right that's that's a good thing so

2274
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,040
i would use it a lot in a training

2275
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,360
circumstance but i wouldn't use it very

2276
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:28,080
much with a real team

2277
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:30,080
right because they don't care

2278
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,080
they're like well how does that help me

2279
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,679
do anything

2280
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,280
right just because the scrum guide says

2281
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,600
it

2282
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,280
yeah you know martin that i i do that i

2283
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,800
avoid using even the name of the scrum

2284
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,639
guy because then you sound like a

2285
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,400
jehovah witness or you know someone

2286
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,199
holding the bible

2287
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,320
but

2288
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:48,719
but

2289
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,960
these guys i'm working with they

2290
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,880
rub it against me the scrum guide says

2291
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,800
so and so and then they take literally

2292
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,080
whatever they want to

2293
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:01,520
understand from them

2294
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:03,199
it's easy to to to misinterpret and to

2295
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,679
to to use

2296
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:07,520
there's a lot of things

2297
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,600
i i think the thing i one of the things

2298
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,520
i liked and not just about the 2020 but

2299
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,600
the one version before that is they

2300
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,040
brought the scrum values

2301
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,679
front and center

2302
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,679
in the scrum guide and it's still not as

2303
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:21,520
strong as i would like because it's

2304
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,119
almost the thing that you're building

2305
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:26,000
everything else on

2306
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:28,880
um but it is it is it is difficult to

2307
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,800
coach that into teams um and

2308
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,159
you're in a nordic

2309
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:35,280
state

2310
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,880
um and that makes your life double

2311
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:39,920
doubly difficult

2312
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,159
um i do a lot of work and training in

2313
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,679
norway and sweden um not so much in

2314
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:46,960
denmark although i've done some training

2315
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,480
in denmark was it denmark

2316
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,719
it was denmark wasn't that you were in

2317
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,480
carla

2318
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:53,760
not feeling like finland finland no i

2319
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,639
haven't done anything in finland but

2320
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,679
it's

2321
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:58,719
that

2322
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:00,960
it's very weird it's it

2323
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:00,960
so

2324
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,760
um

2325
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:08,800
something that that um

2326
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:11,600
my wife almost always comments on

2327
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:14,320
is that northern europeans

2328
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,880
don't show a lot of emotion

2329
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:19,199
and and she has this joke

2330
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,880
um that this is the expression that

2331
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:23,119
somebody in in northern europe who's

2332
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:24,320
excited has

2333
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:25,840
this is the expression they have when

2334
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:28,159
they're unhappy

2335
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,320
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2336
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:32,400
yeah you just you just you just don't

2337
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,159
you can't you can't see

2338
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,159
uh what people feel i've done a lot of

2339
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:38,880
presentations at conferences in norway

2340
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:41,040
and it's super hard to get engagement

2341
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,639
with the with the audience

2342
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:45,119
but something that i found interesting

2343
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,880
is doing workshops in this sort of way i

2344
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,880
use a lot of liberating structures and

2345
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:51,600
those kind of constructs

2346
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,760
and i've actually found when i i teach a

2347
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:56,639
lot of class i teach regular uh scrum

2348
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:58,400
master classes in oslo

2349
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:01,119
um and we get a lot of really good

2350
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,560
engagement after the first few few hours

2351
01:41:01,119 --> 01:41:03,600
because you've got to get them warmed up

2352
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,360
you know

2353
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,880
rub them together to get them warmed up

2354
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,320
once once they get warmed up and they're

2355
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,320
doing lots of breakout rooms when they

2356
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:12,880
do smaller breakout rooms they start

2357
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:14,560
people start engaging right introverts

2358
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,639
start engaging and then when you bring

2359
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,040
them back to the main room they're still

2360
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,600
in that engagement mode yeah

2361
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,520
um so that that that really works so use

2362
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,760
lots of breakout rooms lots of smaller

2363
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,880
breakout rooms in those groups

2364
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,080
yeah yeah

2365
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,679
yeah

2366
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:31,600
the more stoney-faced people are the

2367
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,679
more breakout rooms you use

2368
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,560
yeah that or

2369
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:36,560
bring alcohol

2370
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,159
yeah i live in scotland i'm not opposed

2371
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,119
to that

2372
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:43,119
not opposed to that

2373
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:49,600
uh well this this was awesome hopefully

2374
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,040
uh you have some things uh that you can

2375
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,239
you can take back

2376
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,800
um what i would love to do and i've lost

2377
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,600
my little grid lines so i'll maybe put

2378
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:01,040
uh

2379
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:03,360
some on there but if you could um add a

2380
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:06,080
couple of post-its to our little uh

2381
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,960
board here for what weren't what worked

2382
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,520
well

2383
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,679
uh what needs to change

2384
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,159
um

2385
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,400
which one uh sorry it's just below the

2386
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:18,480
one we were on i i i didn't want to

2387
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:20,480
summon because people would yeah it's

2388
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:22,159
just because people were still typing so

2389
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:25,119
i didn't want to summon

2390
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:26,639
um let me lock that there we go

2391
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,880
i'll add

2392
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:31,920
little boxes obviously hopefully the

2393
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:35,360
mural things dropping behind

2394
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:38,480
uh problem will get fixed

2395
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:40,639
by uh by mural pretty soon

2396
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,800
but it's been there for a week so you

2397
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,199
know maybe they're struggling

2398
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,199
um

2399
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:53,360
the this session sometimes we have

2400
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,560
a few people

2401
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:58,800
like this this is probably a mid-sized

2402
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,920
session for the definition of done one

2403
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,960
last

2404
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,239
two weeks ago we had about 24 people at

2405
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,080
one point

2406
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:08,560
and i think for the agile leadership we

2407
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:10,960
had 34 people at one point for the agile

2408
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:14,239
leadership one uh they're all they were

2409
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,360
all recorded they're all available on uh

2410
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,560
youtube

2411
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,800
um

2412
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:21,040
so you can go look back at the the old

2413
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:23,040
exercise but obviously it's not as it's

2414
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:25,440
not as fun watching it as it is being

2415
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:28,000
there um

2416
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,440
so that's that's why i see regular faces

2417
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,280
coming back time after time because we

2418
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:34,239
have lots of fun and trying to figure

2419
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:36,960
new stuff out so if you do have uh

2420
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:39,119
new ideas and topics

2421
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,239
particular topics you would like

2422
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:43,520
um

2423
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:44,800
myself or anna and i to create uh little

2424
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,600
workshops

2425
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,719
on

2426
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,360
uh

2427
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,199
then we would happily happily do that

2428
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,880
and it can be pretty much

2429
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:54,560
pretty much any topic

2430
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,360
that you like

2431
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,360
um i

2432
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:03,679
i i i'm not sure i can help you with

2433
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,280
that with your product backlog there i

2434
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,560
i've seen a lot of product backlogs that

2435
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:08,000
look like that

2436
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,600
at fubard

2437
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,400
um

2438
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,800
so

2439
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,800
yeah

2440
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,880
nexus next is an interesting one because

2441
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,080
um

2442
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:23,920
yeah it's i've i think i've there's the

2443
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:26,480
scaled professional scrum class i've

2444
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,880
taught it three times ever and i've been

2445
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:31,360
able to teach it for nearly ten years

2446
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:34,480
um and part of the reason for that is it

2447
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:36,800
can't you cannot run it as a small class

2448
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,639
you need a minimum of eight

2449
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,199
to run the exercises because you need

2450
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:43,360
two teams it's better with four teams so

2451
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:46,080
it's better with 16

2452
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:48,400
and not many people buy a scaling class

2453
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:51,040
most of the time when organizations

2454
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:53,280
contact me and they talk about scaling

2455
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,480
i'm like how often do your teams deliver

2456
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,760
working software at the end of the

2457
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,280
sprint and they're like oh we can't do

2458
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,280
that yet i'm like you don't want to talk

2459
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,920
about scaling yet let's talk about doing

2460
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:04,719
that first because if you try and scale

2461
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,840
before you can deliver stuff well

2462
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:09,840
that's going to suck even more so

2463
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,119
and that's actually the first the first

2464
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:13,600
exercise

2465
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:16,960
in the the

2466
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:18,800
the course is don't scale

2467
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,480
is the first exercise in the course yeah

2468
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,760
that's how you solve your problem don't

2469
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,760
scale it's not a good idea

2470
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:29,679
off the first rule of fight

2471
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:32,080
first rule of the scaling a gel don't

2472
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:34,320
yeah that is absolutely the first rule

2473
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,360
so what what jeff sutherland would talk

2474
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,800
about

2475
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,840
is um

2476
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,360
if if the difference between a mediocre

2477
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,159
team

2478
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:47,199
and a high performing amazing team is

2479
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:49,760
about 400 percent

2480
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:52,320
right so he'd rather take one team and

2481
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:54,719
make them awesome than put four mediocre

2482
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,600
teams together because you multiply

2483
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:59,119
mediocrity with the complexities of of

2484
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:00,239
scaling and working together with that

2485
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:02,960
many people

2486
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:04,800
so um yeah but unfortunately many big

2487
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:06,880
organizations just throw a big group of

2488
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,320
people at a problem

2489
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:13,119
and expect it to just work out

2490
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:15,520
right and it just doesn't so that's

2491
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:18,000
that's the way it is

2492
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,480
oh valuable daily scrum because we did

2493
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,719
which one we did sprint review

2494
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,280
we did a sprint review

2495
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:27,119
uh uh set up and we did a definition of

2496
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,360
done workshop so daily scrum in fact

2497
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:30,719
that was the one you said earlier wasn't

2498
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:32,320
it anna you said you wanted to do a

2499
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:36,320
daily scrum one

2500
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:38,480
yeah um and we're basically going with

2501
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:41,600
that in our organization and we're

2502
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:43,600
changing a lot of things about dailies

2503
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:46,080
and we're going to do a workshop with

2504
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,840
the whole organization not only the the

2505
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,679
the

2506
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,920
uh about daily

2507
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:54,320
uh so maybe i can

2508
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:57,760
maybe we can yeah maybe we can backport

2509
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:59,600
that to yeah and to run as a workshop

2510
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,840
then you'll be able to practice on your

2511
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,520
on your company and see what works

2512
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,400
yeah mo

2513
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,400

01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,600
class yes it's a big mouthful that's

2536
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:04,639
like the longest class ever

2537
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:07,520
that class name um so on

2538
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,679

but it's on my community

2540
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,800
portal and i know i can't find it

2541
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,840
it's here somewhere there it is

2542
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:20,000
um let me get a link to that there it is

2543
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:23,280
experiment wednesday

2544
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,480
i put it up uh uh yesterday i'll pop it

2545
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,800
in the chat

2546
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:31,119
um

2547
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:33,360
and it's a little competition uh to win

2548
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:34,880
those four tickets to give away one for

2549
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,480
each class

2550
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,080
is the idea

2551
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:41,119
and

2552
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:43,280
wednesday yeah experiment wednesday uh

2553
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:45,520
so you can you can sign up to that and

2554
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:47,440
hopefully uh get a ticket those

2555
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,119
classes are open and available anyway

2556
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:52,320
they're just public classes

2557
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:54,159
um and depending on which region you are

2558
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:57,520
in the world you get different discounts

2559
01:48:54,159 --> 01:49:00,320
so if you take if you've taken a csm

2560
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:02,719
this is a good one if you've taken a csm

2561
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:04,960
and you want to do a psm

2562
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:07,600
i'll give you a 70 discount

2563
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,760
instead of you renewing your csm

2564
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,840
membership there you go

2565
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,480
that could be

2566
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,520
if you have the scrum alliance and you

2567
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,480
do the

2568
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:20,320
scrum work then you get a 70 that's a

2569
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,639
martin discount

2570
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:25,119
so i'm i'm like if you go to another

2571
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:27,679
trainer they won't be doing that right

2572
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:29,920
but i so yes

2573
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:32,480
yes so i do something called i call it

2574
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,880
the professional scrum reruns

2575
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,840
right that if anybody's taking a class

2576
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,920
with me

2577
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:39,360
they get a 70 discount if they want to

2578
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,599
take it again because sometimes people

2579
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,280
want to realign after a couple of years

2580
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:45,199
they want to do it with a bigger class

2581
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,040
or a different group of people it can be

2582
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:48,480
a lot of fun anyway because we do it's

2583
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:50,880
basically

2584
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:53,199
14 hours of this sort of workshops right

2585
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:57,119
over four half days uh so it's like a

2586
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:59,280
little event um but if so i give people

2587
01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:02,560
who have taken a psm with me that

2588
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,159
discount i also extend it to anybody who

2589
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,119

or

2593
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,440
whatever else if you can prove to me

01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,960
is that random or can i just refresh and

2603
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:35,119
try to get the one i want

2604
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,800
no so it's it's

2605
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:38,800
okay so

2606
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,880
yeah i understand what you're saying so

2607
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,960
it's a it's a prize draw and there are

2608
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,920
four prizes

2609
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,000
so

2610
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,880
you can't you're just entering into the

2611
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,719
draw

2612
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:53,920
um and if if two people one and two

2613
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:57,040
people desperately wanted to do a psm

2614
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,360
then i would probably swap out

2615
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,320
the ticket they did win for a psm that's

2616
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:04,480
okay

2617
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:06,320
right i'm i'm i'm not going to be

2618
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,440
an ass about it i'm going to be

2619
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:09,440
reasonable

2620
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:11,119
uh so if you if you want a psk and you

2621
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,199
don't want to do a psk then i would

2622
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,320
probably happily do you a different one

2623
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:16,159
okay

2624
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,400
so i just put four there's there's four

2625
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:20,159
tickets up for grabs

2626
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:22,080

2630
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:29,280
the what ticket do you prefer after your

2631
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:30,880
yes i did ask that as well just in case

2632
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:33,440
and i've been looking at the stats for

2633
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,440
that as well

2634
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,480

2636
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:46,239
everybody for your time thank you anna

2637
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,840
for helping helping build and run

2638
01:51:46,239 --> 01:51:50,560
the workshop that's the second one we've

2639
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:54,800
done together i think it's it's adding

2640
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,800
value because she's keeping me on time

2641
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,560
step by step

2642
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:03,199
um

2643
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,360
so all i hope to see you at the next one

2644
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:07,040
which will be in two weeks which we have

2645
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:10,480
not yet really decided what we're going

2646
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:13,119
to do but it sounds like the daily scrum

2647
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,719
is an interesting one for folks

2648
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:16,320
um so maybe

2649
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:18,159
there's a few people nodding so that

2650
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,620
might be the one we pick

2651
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:21,689
um

2652
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:21,689
[Music]

2653
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,679
doesn't matter it's good

2654
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,360
yeah that i and

2655
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,800
if there's any topics you do want just

2656
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,560
let me know you can ping me on the

2657
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,840
community site you can

2658
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,840
uh ping me on

2659
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,560
how to write a user story it's it's a

2660
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,960
very nice topic

2661
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,520
how to write a user story did i did i do

2662
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:48,480
that one

2663
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,320
no i didn't but i did i did a private

2664
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,000
workshop the other day

2665
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,159
on user stories

2666
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,560
so i'm happy to repurpose that so we'll

2667
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:59,520
put user stories on the list as well

2668
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:01,360
um i don't know if it's an awesome one

2669
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,199
but it is one

2670
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,880
that makes sense

2671
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:06,400
like sometimes we have to iterate on the

2672
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,239
value and

2673
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:11,520
that you actually get out of it

2674
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:12,960
um but i can certainly run one

2675
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,440
that might be more popular than the

2676
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:18,320
daily scrum one

2677
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,320
his user stories

2678
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:24,239
so if anybody has any questions you're

2679
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:25,199
happy to hang out but i'm gonna wrap it

2680
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:27,360
up

2681
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:29,520
um and

2682
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:34,040
yeah it was it was awesome to have

2683
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:34,040
