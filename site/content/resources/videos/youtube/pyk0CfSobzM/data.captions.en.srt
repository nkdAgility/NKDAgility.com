1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,960
that's a great question so the question

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,660
is how does a scrum team estimate uh

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,820
what can be delivered in a single Sprint

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,500
and the ultimate answer is maybe the

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,039
don't

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,460
um the scrum guide does not have the

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,580
word estimate or estimation appear

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,460
anywhere within its contents

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,900
it uses the word size

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,420
the team should be able to understand

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,120
the size of things on their product

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,880
backlog and which is not quite the same

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,640
as estimate

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,440
um estimation is a is a great tool there

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,620
are various estimation tools and

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,940
techniques that teams can use

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,300
I generally use those tools and

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,920
techniques to help teams understand the

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,620
things on the put it back look better

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,140
because I find it's much more valuable

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,699
much more important to have the

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,699
developers and the product owner and the

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,379
stakeholders understand things than it

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,780
does to say it's going to do this amount

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,860
of time right because ultimately if we

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,020
say it's going to take this amount of

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,560
time we're talking at our butt there's

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,960
there's no way for us to know how long a

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,600
creative piece of work is going to take

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,400
it's just not possible think to yourself

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,000
I I I'd like you to to write a book on

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,040
the topic of uh leadership in the United

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
Kingdom political leadership in the

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,340
United Kingdom them how long would it

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,960
take you to write that I want you to

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,579
tell me off off the top of your head how

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,840
long will it take you to write that you

38
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,000
don't know you can't answer that

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,340
question you could probably take a rough

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,619
guess but you might be orders of

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,140
magnitude under or orders of magnitude

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,000
over because you don't know whether

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,920
you're going to get writer's block you

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,240
don't know whether you're gonna not be

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
able to find a critical piece of

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,899
information that your brain thinks you

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,640
need you don't you don't know any of

48
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,100
those things you can't predict those

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,119
things so the the the the the surprises

50
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,560
that happen when you're Building

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,920
Products

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,140
things you don't know and give you a

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,860
very high level of variance so the idea

54
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,900
that you can estimate things you don't

55
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,540
know how to do yet

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,120
um is is just ridiculous it's very

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,260
different from the story of

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,920
um if I asked uh electrician to estimate

59
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,379
how much it will cost to rewire my house

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,900
that's something that they probably can

61
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,920
estimate because they've done houses

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:40,739
like mine before right they've they've

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,040
my house is not that much different from

64
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,500
anybody else's house the way you wire is

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,420
not different from anybody else's house

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,580
when you're building a product that

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,920
doesn't exist yet

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,379
the tools and techniques and practices

69
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,660
and ideas and architectures and ways of

70
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,819
doing things don't exist yet you have to

71
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,400
come up with those and that's where

72
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,640
those surprises come in

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,459
um so how can a team estimate what can

74
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,760
be delivered in a Sprint I think they

75
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,920
take a guess like everybody else does

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,800
that's why you're you're your Sprint

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,860
goal should never be the whole Sprint it

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,019
should only be part of the Sprint

79
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,480
because you might be you might be wrong

80
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,159
you might think this will take two of

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,900
the 10 days that you have in your

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,840
two-week Sprint and actually it takes

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,580
five okay well we've we've we've built

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,860
that in by having a Sprint goal that's

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,720
much more targeted and we are going to

86
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,159
drop some of the other stuff that we

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,440
brought into the Sprint that we thought

88
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,819
we we would be able to do but maybe we

89
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,000
can't the Sprint

90
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,000
so the answer ultimately is you don't

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,819
