    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on hiring Agile coaches, emphasizing traits such as technical understanding, leadership engagement, business acumen, and cultural fit. Nowhere does it directly or indirectly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), its definition, calculation, or application. There is no reference to SLE as a delivery forecasting tool, probability-based time range, or associated improvement practices. The main ideas, depth, and purpose center on the competencies needed in Agile coaching rather than team delivery metrics or workflow predictability. There are no audience mismatches or outdated practices, so no penalties are applied. The very low confidence reflects the near-complete absence of SLE-relevant concepts; any vague alignment (e.g., vaguely impacting delivery) is incidental rather than intentional and is not explored or named. These factors justify a very low confidence score.",
