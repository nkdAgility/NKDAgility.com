    "reasoning": "The content discusses the principles of Kanban, emphasizing continuous improvement, metrics, and collaboration, which align with tenets of Agile methodologies. However, while it offers actionable steps to implement Kanban, the discussion is broad and lacks specific, prescriptive tenets related to Agile or Lean practices. The focus on culture and metrics supports the actionable aspect of tenets but could be more explicitly tied to established tenets in these frameworks. Thus, it warrants a moderate confidence score.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses Kanban as a methodology that promotes continuous improvement, flexibility, and metrics for workflow enhancement, which are related to capability. However, the primary focus is on the implementation of Kanban rather than systemically developing capabilities as defined in the 'Capability' category. It touches on metrics and culture but lacks a deeper exploration of cohesive organizational capabilities. Therefore, while it relates to the theme, it does not fully meet the criteria for a strong focus on capability.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a general introductory guide to launching a Kanban pilot, focusing on workflow visualization, WIP limits, and metrics such as cycle time and throughput. There is no explicit mention or explanation of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor discussion of its calculation, definition, or application within Agile, Scrum, or Kanban frameworks. While the post addresses relevant metrics (cycle time, throughput), these are discussed in the context of general process improvement rather than explicitly tying them to SLE. Audience alignment is partial, since readers interested in Kanban fundamentals may also be interested in SLE, but the content does not address SLE practitioners specifically. The overall discussion does not provide depth or purpose fit for the SLE category, and the signal-to-noise ratio is low regarding SLE, as the material is focused elsewhere. No penalties were applicable, as the material is neither outdated nor satirical. Confidence is very low due to lack of direct references or conceptual coverage of SLE.",
