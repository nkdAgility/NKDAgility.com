1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
so how easy is it to get started with

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,280
caman to to have a pilot to to try

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,799
something it's it's it's super easy pick

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,599
a team apply a cman strategy it's really

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,800
that that easy um sometimes it's

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,800
difficult to convince people uh people

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,279
behave how they're measured so normally

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,920
it's the the the the traditional metrics

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,519
and measures within the organization

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,080
that prevent you from doing some of

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,559
these things but there are tools out

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,440
there that can help if most folks today

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,920
most are probably using either jir or a

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,000
your devops uh to to to manage their

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,559
work since most of us work from home

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,840
quite a lot of the time right uh so we

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,120
don't have the boards on the wall

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,160
anymore we don't have the opportunity

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,359
for that um so

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,399
using get get get access to some of the

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,600
data analytics uh in both jira and uh

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,160
aure devops and look at some of the data

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,559
look at the the camand data look at the

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,479
graphs um and see what's going on in

25
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,080
your current system right that's that's

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,280
see what's going on and then get

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
together and run a workshop run a

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,920
workshop on Define creating your

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,439
definition of workflow defining how the

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,759
way it is you work just now start to

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,400
have those conversations but don't think

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,439
absolutely do not think you can have a

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,119
two-hour workshop and then you're done

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,479
that two-hour Workshop is just a start

35
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,360
for for starting people thinking about

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,479
how they work because most most people

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
don't really understand how they work

38
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,360
they don't understand how they work cuz

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
they just do it they just do it the way

40
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,840
they do it they've never had to write it

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
down they've never had to discuss it

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,119
with each other and you start having

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,159
very interesting conversations with the

44
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,320
team that Arc of conversations kind of

45
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,280
needs to play out right in order to get

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,479
to consensus of this is the way we agree

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,719
how we work once you've got that

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,520
agreement you're you're you're you're

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,200
doing caman but you can just start with

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,679
the

51
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,080
metrics right Sometimes using metrics to

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,959
kind of Drive people's behaviors can be

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,959
super valuable so if you started

54
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:23,160
recording the cycle time from when work

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,440
starts to when it finishes in the system

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,519
and just start looking at that data how

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,480
long does work take on average to go

58
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,640
through the system how long does an

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,720
indiv idual item take to go through the

60
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,160
system and then you can look at

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,680
something like a cycle time scatter plot

62
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
and look for outliers right this is

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,200
something that you actually don't need

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,920
any Buy in from anybody in the team or

65
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,280
anybody in the organization to do load

66
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,080
the current data from Azure devops or

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,200
jira into a a tool that lets you

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,200
visualize the cand metrics and look at

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,560
what's going

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,280
on start asking more interesting

71
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,200
question

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,200
questions during uh uh your your

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,879
meetings and events that you have with

74
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,640
the

75
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,959
team right when you see those outliers

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,680
that that piece of work that took uh you

77
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,440
know we do we do two week Sprints and

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,480
there's a piece of work that took 430

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:24,120
days to complete right ask that question

80
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,120
at the retr why did this take 430 days

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,920
what what could we have done differently

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,439
right that's asking more and using the

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,159
data to ask more interesting questions

84
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,720
and as you start asking those more

85
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:38,000
interesting questions hopefully somebody

86
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,920
on your team or in your group or or a

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,159
leader will ask how do you know how did

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,879
you see this where how did you spot

89
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,760
these things and you can start

90
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,319
introducing little pieces of Camp say

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,239
I'm using this psycle time scatter plot

92
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,280
it's showing that all of these items are

93
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,439
above the 95th percentile these are the

94
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
outliers so I'm asking questions about

95
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,519
these and and why are they like that and

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,200
how how do they how do they go together

97
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,680
oh that's really cool is there any more

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,159
data like that well yes there is you can

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,319
start having those

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,840
conversations so it's I think it's very

101
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:18,479
easy to start using caman in the

102
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,759
organization all it takes is any

103
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,080
individual on the team to start

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,720
analyzing the data and looking and

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:33,080
suggesting optimizations for the

106
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,199
team trying bu build some credibility so

107
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,400
that you can start having discussions

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,759
about definition of workflow you can do

109
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,400
it Ninja right you can say well how do

110
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,560
we pick you know doing the retrospective

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,280
I I I'm interested in how we all pick

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,160
the next piece of work we're going to do

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,759
oh well I do this and I do that and I do

114
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,240
the other thing start pulling on those

115
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,680
threads just start pulling on the

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,440
threads so ultimately how easy is it to

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,160
create a cam pilot in your organization

118
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,800
super easy just do it it just needs one

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,639
person to start looking at the data one

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,160
person to start asking more interesting

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,479
questions if your current system of work

122
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,840
is failing you then you would benefit

123
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,880
from creating and applying a cand

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,720
strategy our professional cand trainers

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,960
and Consultants are ready to help don't

126
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,400
wait the sooner you start the sooner

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,400
you'll improve getting touch below
