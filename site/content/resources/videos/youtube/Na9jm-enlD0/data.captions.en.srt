1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,099
question is where is consensus valuable

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
where does it kill great product

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,799
development

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
and I think that's that's a that's a

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,900
really interesting topic consensus just

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,439
means general agreement

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,240
right that everybody generally agrees

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,180
and sometimes

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,619
getting to agreement is the Right Way

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,480
Forward

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,660
but also

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,780
conversely sometimes making a decision

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,140
is is is the right answer

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,200
but trying to split that

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,020
and figure out how

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,300
in what circumstances you want to make a

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,800
decision based on consensus and what

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,140
circumstance you want to make a decision

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,300
based on you know we're making a

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,520
decision and we're going this direction

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,620
it's something that is

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,899
um very much at the heart of of the

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,420
complexity being a product owner right

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,619
if you think about the product owner as

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:11,100
a as a mini CEO or an entrepreneur right

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,060
um we're we're perhaps operating

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,320
in a in a highly Dynamic highly volatile

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,100
Market

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,320
and things can change quite quick

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,380
and sometimes if we want to take

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,060
advantage of opportunities that are

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,979
floating by

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,119
we need to just make a decision and go

34
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:37,439
for it and as long as we're oh what

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,200
what's the I usually an organization is

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,060
generally an organization is willing to

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,500
make a financial bet on seven percent

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:50,100
success right that's that's the general

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,020
it's a good bet if it's 70 as a success

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,799
it's a bad benefits it's less than that

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,619
but people that are entrepreneurs

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,000
tend to accept a much higher degree of

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,719
risk than that 70 right there there that

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,920
70 is like bricks and mortar

45
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,619
organization that that's that's that's

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,879
uh what they look at and other Financial

47
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,120
departments

48
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,140
but for an entrepreneur you you see an

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,620
opportunity

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,020
and you have a you have a gut feel right

51
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,599
and usually it's not really a gut feel

52
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,040
right it's based on your experience and

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,440
the data that you've got and you're

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,980
making a call but yes I'm going to

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,520
invest in this in this in this idea

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,080
um

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,360
but if you've familiar with

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,260
startups

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,660
um

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,879
50 of all startups fail in the first

61
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,819
year

62
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,500
and 70 of the rest fail in the first

63
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,959
five years

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,580
so you've actually got a really small

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,560
chance of success from being an

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,660
entrepreneur

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,099
so to be that entrepreneur you have to

68
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,980
be continually

69
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,140
making making decisions trying stuff

70
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,940
failing making stuff trying to stop

71
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,980
failing what was the what's the the bad

72
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,720
Edison quote I know it's a bad quote he

73
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,319
didn't I don't know I'm sure he 100 said

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,980
this but the the cut the consensus quote

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,860
right that is probably wrong is that um

76
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,140
he said uh I didn't figure out how to

77
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,920
make a light bulb I found 99 ways you

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,260
can make light but right because it took

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,540
a hundred tries at something to get that

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,959
one thing that worked 99 things

81
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,220
um so so that that's the mind of the

82
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,060
entrepreneur that's the difference

83
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,099
between a a big organization CEO and an

84
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,080
entrepreneur is the amount of risk

85
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,180
they're willing to accept

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,700
in in in the Endeavors that they're

87
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,879
trying to trying to achieve yeah look at

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,480
Elon Musk buying Twitter right that's uh

89
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,480
that's a really high high risk of

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,000
potential failure but if you disrupt

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,580
enough and change enough and keep

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,159
changing until you get to those ideas

93
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,280
that's that entrepreneurial mindset

94
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,340
so that that in the product owner as an

95
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,620
entrepreneur can work at the small scale

96
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,380
as well as the the bigger scale if you

97
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,720
look in the the scrum guide right

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,840
um it's quite explicitly says Everybody

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,060
Must uh respect

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,520
um the the product order right the the

101
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,680
product owners decisions that they made

102
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,320
and part of that is because sometimes we

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,060
have to move quickly that's one

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,919
sometimes we just have to try stuff even

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,500
if we're not 100 sure it's going to be

106
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,500
successful so you might be making a

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,120
decision to try something even though

108
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,120
lots of other people think it's a bad

109
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,139
idea right

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
um and

111
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,660
that that's that's that's where

112
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,820
you you have that piece of it's it's not

113
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,100
about consensus it's about just making

114
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,040
the decision and moving forward

115
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,780
but on the other side of that you've got

116
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,520
the times when you when you do want to

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,280
get consensus

118
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,180
um because it's very difficult

119
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,820
to it's very difficult to do stuff

120
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,820
when the people that you need help from

121
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,400
to do stuff

122
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,080
believe you're wrong right if they

123
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,300
believe you're wrong

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,419
they're not gonna help

125
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,280
right or entrepreneurs kind of sidestep

126
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,340
that by

127
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,340
um

128
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,759
building a group of people around them

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,979
that are supportive of their vision

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,199
so that when they do have to make

131
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,539
decisions that people are like really

132
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:53,699
we're gonna go that way

133
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,860
oh you know uh uh Leslie the the CEO the

134
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,600
entrepreneur Leslie's like yeah this is

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,039
the way we're going they're like okay we

136
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,780
trust you we're gonna we're gonna move

137
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
forward and go anyway right that's how

138
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,259
they get support for that so you've got

139
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,539
people that support you so that's not

140
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,060
really consensus but it kind of is it's

141
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:11,340
that other type of consensus where it's

142
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,080
lead consensus right

143
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,080
but you have another type of consensus

144
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,220
where you you and this is more

145
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,220
facilitation idea of of of of consensus

146
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,479
or at least convergence right it doesn't

147
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,479
have to be consensus but it's

148
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,280
convergence and that facilitation idea

149
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,780
and I don't mean just a facilitator

150
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,039
right this could be the product owner

151
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,660
this could be the scrum Master this

152
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,000
could be a team member this could be in

153
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,500
a video you're you're

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,380
trying to

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,180
um um brainstorm ideas for your family

156
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,720
vacation right it doesn't doesn't matter

157
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,440
what it what it is but you have this

158
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,380
this uh um initial expansion of ideas

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,479
right when you ask a group of people how

160
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,120
might we solve this problem

161
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,800
we're gonna generate hopefully right

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,800
lots and lots and lots and lots of ideas

163
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,620
so we get this big buildup of idea and

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,240
then you want to get to what's the thing

165
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,199
we're gonna try what's the thing we're

166
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,000
gonna do

167
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,020
but there might have been 15 different

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,500
options

169
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,880
how do we not only get to the thing we

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,960
want to try

171
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,960
but gain

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,539
a moratorium of consensus so that

173
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,520
everybody's behind the thing because if

174
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,680
people aren't behind something it ain't

175
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,199
gonna happen no matter how how awesome

176
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,199
it is it's not gonna happen if the

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,599
people are not are not behind it that's

178
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,620
that's why that's why I feel a lot of

179
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:43,259
projects fail is that that there's no

180
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,599
attempt to get people behind it they're

181
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,099
just told what to do so you end up with

182
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,900
those I don't know if you remember and

183
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:52,020
the old old traditional days you had

184
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,599
death march projects and a death march

185
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,000
project is where every single person

186
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,800
that's working on it knows that it's not

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,840
gonna work right they know in their

188
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,539
bones that it's not gonna work so what

189
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,340
happens it doesn't work right but

190
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:07,919
somebody thinks it will work and keeps

191
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,419
going towards it spending the money but

192
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,699
nothing happens you want to avoid that

193
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,280
and I think the the the this this

194
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,460
building to consensus is getting

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,199
everybody behind the idea even if they

196
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,599
don't necessarily think it's the best

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,599
idea right that's that's for me is

198
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,479
building consensus around that that

199
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,160
story so this this

200
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,979
to get back to the original question

201
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,060
right where is consensus valuable and

202
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,940
where does it kill a great product

203
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,520
development it doesn't it's always

204
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,080
valuable but how you achieve it is

205
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:46,560
different depending on your circumstance

206
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,779
if you're the CEO you gain consensus by

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,140
creating an environment where everybody

208
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:55,260
trusts your decisions they're far

209
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,180
they're willing to go along with and are

210
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,680
happy with your decisions because they

211
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,300
know the chances of you being successful

212
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,920
are fairly High because you've built a

213
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,200
level of trust with them that's

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,380
consensus through leadership but then

215
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,360
you've got also got consensus through

216
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,240
um collaboration right we're

217
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,519
collaborating together as a group

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,279
um we want to generate this is usually

219
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,380
on the macro scale the the CEO is making

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,660
the decisions on the big on the on the

221
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,060
macro scale and then on the micro scale

222
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,440
you've got lots of little decisions that

223
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,480
have to be made by the team lots of

224
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,399
things to try lots of things to do and

225
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,140
you need those ideas and then consensus

226
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,820
and you have to navigate that growing

227
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,800
zone in the middle right that's usually

228
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,200
what it's called the drone zone where

229
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,959
where stuff's just you know nobody

230
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,399
agrees on anything and you have to as a

231
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,160
good facilitator

232
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,300
even the CEO has to do this has to

233
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,980
figure out we're going to generate a

234
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,779
bunch of ideas and then I have to get it

235
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,839
down to what it is we're going to try

236
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,600
that everybody's willing to get behind

237
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,459
I've had more census behind so that it

238
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,080
moves forward and it has the possibility

239
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,300
of being successful

240
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,279
so I think I think consensus is

241
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,980
absolutely imperative

242
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,959
to all aspects of product development

243
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,100
but there are different routes to

244
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,080
achieving it depending on the

245
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,580
circumstance right you might have fast

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,620
moving stuff where you have to make

247
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,300
decisions and people trust you

248
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,920
but how do you build that trust in the

249
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,500
first place well you have to do all this

250
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,019
other stuff to gain consensus in the

251
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,540
other way that people I you know you get

252
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,700
them behind it because you get them to

253
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,860
agree to be behind it even if they don't

254
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,959
think it's the best idea and then oh wow

255
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,779
that was successful you just gained

256
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,000
credibility to then make a decision and

257
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,100
have people people support it

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,160
so I think um

259
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,260
it is absolutely imperative but it's

260
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,980
also important

261
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,120
um

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,120
to think about

263
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:53,339
I really recommend there's a book

264
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,660
um Mike Voss book

265
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,760
um called Never split the difference

266
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,680
right

267
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,300
um and I think that's our that's a

268
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,300
fantastic

269
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,339
um story about

270
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:10,200
how you create that

271
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:13,019
where are we going

272
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,660
without needing to have a bunch of

273
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,839
people that are unhappy with the outcome

274
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,360
right so the way I think his his little

275
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,100
description is that

276
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,420
um whether you're negotiating because

277
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,700
it's all a negotiation right

278
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,720
collaboration whether you're negotiating

279
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,120
with uh terrorists for hostage release

280
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,940
or you're negotiating with at bedtime

281
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,980
for kids right it doesn't matter the

282
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,380
same rules and techniques apply right

283
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,019
you're trying to get that consensus that

284
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,540
yes this is the right way forward yes

285
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,760
you should go to bed now but if they're

286
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,380
unhappy you know they'll go into their

287
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,519
bedroom and they'll go under the covers

288
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,800
and get the flashlight out and they'll

289
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,839
read their book anyway right or or

290
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,260
whatever whatever it is they'll try to

291
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,260
uh get get not do the thing

292
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,600
so building that consensus is absolutely

293
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,140
imperative but I really recommend never

294
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,360
split difference I recommend uh um

295
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,820
looking at facilitation techniques for

296
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,180
navigating that growing zone to get

297
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,560
consensus and also another awesome book

298
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:22,560
thinking in bits for those entrepreneurs

299
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,560
uh right you you Building Products is

300
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,019
like playing poker right you don't have

301
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,360
all of the information all the time but

302
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,300
you still have to make decisions so how

303
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,740
do you navigate that data analysis and

304
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,360
then make the best decision possible

305
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,420
based on the information that you have

306
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,399
and being consensus along the way
