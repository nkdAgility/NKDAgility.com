00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,519
of the agile apocalypse is chaos chaos

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:13,000
oh my chaos is everywhere in teams um it

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,199
manifests as not having a plan of not

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,840
knowing which way we're going not having

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,439
goals and what would you expect when

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,800
everybody doesn't have the same goal

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,039
this they're not working together

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,039
towards a common goal you end up with

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
chaos everybody's pulling in different

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,320
directions and this applies not just at

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,680
the team level but all the way up your

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,079
organization why would you think

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,640
everybody would be going in the same

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,760
direction if they don't all understand

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,480
the goals of the organization the goals

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,440
of the product and how the work that

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,960
they do every day contributes to those
