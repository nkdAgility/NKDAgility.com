1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
you can't order a

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,799
hierarchy in this video I'm going to

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,480
demonstrate why hierarchies in backlog

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,519
management inhibit the ability for us to

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,120
manage them effectively and how we can

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,080
think about backlock differently my name

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,240
is Martin hinwood I'm a professional

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,119
scrum trainer with scrum.org a

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,000
professional caman trainer with Pro

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,320
caman and I've been a Microsoft MVP in

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,320
devops for 15

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,960
years a backlog is just a list of things

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,840
you're going to do but backlogs have

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,280
some uh special characteristics one of

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,399
those main characteristics is that it's

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,680
ordered in some way uh you still need to

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,640
decide how it's ordered but your backlog

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,399
should have an order IE there's a

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,360
distinct first item second item third

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,440
item there are no items in your backlog

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,760
that have exactly the same level

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,239
therefore it is a flat list of what it

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,160
is we're going to do next or what the

24
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,560
most important thing is the order of the

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,080
backlog informs but does not control the

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,600
selection of the work uh that the team

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,840
is going to work on at any time there

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,439
may be other things that come into that

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,799
story at selection time not just what of

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,680
the most important things uh that are

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,960
there there might be other implications

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,119
in uh uh technology um state of the

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,360
product other things that are going on

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
that we need to consider as we move

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,280
through our product product so why is is

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,920
hierarchy a problem uh the most common

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,040
thing that you see in teams is uh if

38
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,520
depending on the product they're using

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,640
to manage their backlog uh they might

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,920
have epic breakdown into features break

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,439
down into into stories or backlog items

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,960
they might have features break down into

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,079
epics break down into um backlog items

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,159
you might have any any number of other

45
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,680
things going on you might have um I

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,960
don't know initiatives that break down

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,280
into something that break down into the

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,560
theme Here is that you've got things

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,519
that break down into other things I.E a

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,640
parent child relationship if you have a

51
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:24,120
parent child relationship in a a tool um

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,519
it's very difficult um to to manage it

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,319
in a way that allows us to use that

54
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,959
context with without that context

55
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,360
inhibiting our ability to do stuff in

56
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,879
the tool so I'm going to going to show

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,080
some examples and this is also not just

58
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,840
a tooling issue but a mindset issue as

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,560
well if you're thinking about your work

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,519
as a parent child relationship the

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,360
tendency the easy thing that happens is

62
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,720
that we end up with a work breakdown

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,840
structure um which is not effective uh

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,280
because ultimately it's not value for

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,560
focused and that's what we're trying to

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,599
achieve all of uh uh agile whether

67
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,200
you're using a specific agile framework

68
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,799
or you're trying to follow the agile

69
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,879
Manifesto or you're thinking about lean

70
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,280
and caman any of these things is

71
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,560
focusing on the flow of value through

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,120
your system so if you're focused on the

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,599
flow of value through the system you

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,840
need to be focused on the value if

75
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,280
you're focused on the work breakdown you

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,400
tend not to be focused on value you tend

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,319
to be focused on delivering more stuff

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,640
so that's that's the

79
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,200
tendency but what's the relationship uh

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,959
uh that makes it difficult in

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,319
hierarchies so I've created a demo here

82
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,080
to show what the problem is uh so in

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,120
this example I'm just going to use Azure

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,840
devops that's my tool of choice that's

85
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,720
my preference um but this could be any

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,280
tool including just a mural uh uh with

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,239
backlog items so here I've got three uh

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,439
features features One features two

89
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,159
features three and the ENT inent of this

90
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,079
tool is that features work um at a

91
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,640
different level from from backlog items

92
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,400
uh

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,040
and they inform but do not control the

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,959
next level down right but the reality is

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,040
that they do control the next level down

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,000
cuz most people use this kind of I've

97
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,240
got quite a lot of things in there use

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,199
this kind of view to kind of see what's

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,720
going on so you're you're you're looking

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,360
at features breaking down into back

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,680
backlog items here and perhaps those

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:40,919
backlog items uh break down into

103
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:44,880
tasks task one save that oh I need to

104
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,000
close it now I made two don't save that

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,520
one uh so now I've got this hierarchy

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,320
this work breakdown structure towards

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,360
this item and then the tendency is to

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,720
use this View and to put like little

109
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,400
progress bars and whatever you want on

110
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,479
this View and you end up with what looks

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,240
a little bit uh like a project status

112
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,400
report that's the tendency when you when

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,120
you use these types of views with huge

114
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,759
amounts of discipline on your team you

115
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,320
can certainly avoid this uh but I find

116
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,800
that that's not the case for for the

117
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,240
majority of encounters that I've had

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,360
with teams that are doing this the other

119
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,919
thing that makes it very difficult is

120
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,240
that if I want to um make one item more

121
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,800
important than another item

122
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,479
because I'm looking at this view I

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,639
actually tend to only make things

124
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,240
important or not important inside of the

125
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,360
scope of the feature because I can still

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,919
drag and drop inside of here and order

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,039
that hierarchy same as if you were using

128
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,560
just mural and stickies right it has to

129
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,160
be under that feature but if I want to

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,759
make this item more important uh uh less

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,319
important than this item here I want to

132
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,000
drag it below this item and suddenly if

133
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,520
I drop this I now changed the parent

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,759
child relationship from feature one to

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
feature 2 and this is a feature one

136
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,240
element not a feature 2 element and that

137
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,720
doesn't make any sense so I need to go

138
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,120
put that back so when we manage our work

139
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,160
and we're trying to actively manage

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,880
what's going on here it it tends to make

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,840
it a little bit more difficult

142
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,520
to visualize to engage with with the

143
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,360
work what we really want is we want to

144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,080
turn we want people to turn off the

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,560
parents and manage the backlog as a

146
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,840
backlog not as a hierarchy so they're

147
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,960
dragging and dropping things within here

148
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,000
they're ordering this list um and

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,759
creating a view that makes sense just

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,400
for them so the main problems with a

151
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,759
backlog uh hierarchy are the what first

152
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,440
one is the tendency

153
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,080
towards ending up with a work breakdown

154
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,039
structure um the other tenden is to not

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,240
order your backlog because it changes

156
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,240
that parent child relationship and its

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,919
effort to switch between the different

158
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,520
different views it's even more so on on

159
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,680
stickies on a whiteboard right because

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,440
you you have that fixed view you can't

161
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,319
pivot that display that you like you can

162
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,400
in tools and the last uh element that is

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,120
difficult is parent child relationships

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,720
are one parent many children within the

165
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,960
context of almost all all tooling it's a

166
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
tree structure um and that inhibits our

167
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
ability to have an item that goes on our

168
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,560
backlog that has many parents a many to

169
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,080
many relationship right um I might have

170
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,120
a thing that I put in my backlog that

171
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,680
enables five different features and then

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,479
that becomes quite an important thing to

173
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
work on because it enables these five

174
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,000
different features or is the first

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,720
foundation for these five different

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
features and it's very difficult to

177
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,800
represent that when we have that

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,960
breakdown structure from epic to feature

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,360
or high level item to Next Level item

180
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,240
uh to backlog

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,039
item so how can we think differently so

182
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,360
that we don't have this problem um what

183
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,440
we want to be able to do when we're

184
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,800
thinking about our PCT backlog is we

185
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,639
want to think about it as a flat list it

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,840
always should be a flat list and each

187
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,759
item has additional context that

188
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,199
additional context should be able to be

189
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,520
visualized in various ways depending on

190
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,440
the tooling that you're that you're

191
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,479
using whether you're using a a Hub uh

192
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,599
gitlab Azure devops or jira the tooling

193
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,519
will allow you to create some of those

194
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,839
visualizations those pivots on the data

195
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,800
without actually having a hierarchy

196
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,200
parent child relationships that's the

197
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
primary way to do that so I'm going to

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
show you how to do this in Azure devops

199
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,120
I have an example set up here I'm just

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,399
going to use the same uh team and I have

201
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,160
a bunch of things in uh my back hook

202
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,440
here if you ignore that effort uh column

203
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,120
there I will we'll just remove it

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,040
because it's inconsequential for what

205
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,800
we're talking about

206
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,200
here so one of the things uh that we're

207
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,079
we're interested in in this uh list this

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,720
is going to be a flat list um that we're

209
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,360
going to order but there might be

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,760
additional things that we want to take

211
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,839
care of so if you remember um we had a

212
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,800
bunch of things that had uh features

213
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:30,320
assigned to them so what I can uh do is

214
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,440
I can turn on the parents again

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,160
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

216
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,800
get rid of those those those parent

217
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,800
relationships and I'm just going to do

218
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,560
uh tag ad and I'm going to cheat and I'm

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,160
just going to call it feature

220
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,320
one use feature one and I'm going to

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
call this one feature two I'm going to

222
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,000
ignore feature

223
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,839
three tag

224
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,920
ad

225
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,079
now tags need to be a little bit more

226
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,240
deliberate you can control both the

227
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,000
ability for people to create tags uh

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,160
that's

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,279
pre-moderation or you can use a post

230
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,600
moderation technique there is a plugin

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,120
on the store you can see it's got

232
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,760
28,000 uh installs across TFS and asure

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,399
devops um this allows you to actively

234
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,480
post moderate those tags so activities

235
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,920
like merging tags filtering tags uh uh

236
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,839
managing things you can do to manage uh

237
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,000
manage those tasks this work po across

238
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,800
TFS and as your devops I'm sure there is

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,279
the same story in other platforms as

240
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,560
well whether you're using GitHub gitlab

241
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,639
or

242
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,240
jira so now I have a feature assigned to

243
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,959
each work item I can easily open a work

244
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,000
item I can see that it's to do with a

245
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:57,160
particular feature or capability um I

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,800
could even link to that uh capability as

247
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,680
a a link to a Wiki page so I could link

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,519
to an existing item here and just pick a

249
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,880
hyperlink and go to a Wiki page some

250
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,800
kind of documentation on what this is uh

251
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,519
but what I ultimately want to be doing

252
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,320
is managing this flat list of work items

253
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,680
so that I can say that any item is more

254
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,800
important than any other item whether

255
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,000
it's feature one feature two I can

256
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,720
intermingle all of those things between

257
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,880
feature one and feature two to best

258
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,399
represent the business order and

259
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:37,839
business priority of my product backlog

260
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,880
so this is not um implying that this is

261
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,120
the order that we're going to select

262
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,399
items in this doesn't mean that this the

263
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,440
team is going to say well we think we

264
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,880
can do five item in the next 14 days

265
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,920
these or 10 items these 10 items are

266
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,200
ready that that's that's not how that's

267
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,440
supposed to happen uh what a team would

268
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,680
do is on each Cadence where it's

269
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,399
marketing where it's either replenishing

270
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,200
the ready Q in kamban or they're uh

271
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
doing their Sprint planning they're

272
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,320
going to make a a a

273
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,519
decision on how much work are we going

274
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,519
to take in from the from the priority

275
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,040
list versus um how much other work do we

276
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,199
have perhaps there's some uh long

277
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,120
running engineering work that's going on

278
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,040
that has to happen behind the scenes

279
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,399
that the customer do doesn't really care

280
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,240
about in the short term but in the long

281
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,600
term it's going to provide them with a a

282
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,160
huge amount of value so those items are

283
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,839
going to be brought into the Sprint are

284
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:45,399
going to be prioritized um in that same

285
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,839
way as these other uh business items you

286
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,040
may even add them to your product

287
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,519
backlog I don't have any of them in here

288
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,160
although it it does seem like that cuz

289
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,880
there things like review application

290
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,680
architecture but that's for the um

291
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,440
product that is referencing um and then

292
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,079
when I'm looking at this list I might

293
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,959
want to filter and understand what's

294
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:08,120
going on with with certain items so what

295
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,680
I can do is I can hit this filter uh

296
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,680
button here uh and one way to filter

297
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,160
would be to use the tags that we created

298
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,760
so I can say uh here's uh feature one uh

299
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,800
here's all I didn't do the feature one

300
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,880
very well did I um here's all the

301
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,800
feature 2 items and feature one uh

302
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,120
here's just the feature 2 items I can

303
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,880
also look at for example all of the risk

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,560
RIS Guardian items so if I pick risk

305
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,760
Guardian which is one of the projects

306
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,480
that is represented in here so I'm using

307
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,800
tags to not only represent the the the

308
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,040
features that we might be working on and

309
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,760
delivering uh some of those features

310
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,800
might go

311
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,680
across um applications that we're

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,560
building um but we're also able to

313
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,079
filter this by the application that

314
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,720
we're building so I can very clearly see

315
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,800
that these are the items that are part

316
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,079
of feature 2 that are part of this

317
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,639
application um but these three items

318
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,480
down here are not part of feature 2 uh

319
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,040
for that for that application uh so I'm

320
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,279
able to very easily change my filter and

321
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:19,440
say risk guardian and feature 2 and I

322
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,720
can effectively Matrix and filter what

323
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,360
I'm looking at to see what I might want

324
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,079
to take on into the the next Sprint uh

325
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
so in Azure devops uh I might even do

326
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,360
some little bit of plan

327
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,399
and there's my future Sprints for this

328
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:39,480
team um and I'm just going to do some

329
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,680
arbitrary uh uh uh forward forward

330
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,639
forecasting I'm not using a tool here uh

331
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,839
uh to do probabilistic forecasting but

332
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,399
I'm just taking a guess which is very

333
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,959
much a bad way to do it uh but you can

334
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,480
see on this list the actual order of

335
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:59,079
these items on the backlog and I'm not

336
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,000
able to reorder those items because

337
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,720
because I don't have that full uh uh uh

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,920
list of items cuz we're filtering right

339
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,399
it disables that ability to order but I

340
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,680
can still go in here and move to a

341
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,199
certain position um within this uh list

342
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,199
so I can say move to it's 25 I want to

343
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,279
move it to about eight move to eight and

344
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,639
then we can go fine tune that later uh

345
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,000
but here you're seeing there's one item

346
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,320
that's really important um for risk

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,560
Guardian here uh at four and then these

348
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,120
things are a little bit further down the

349
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,959
chain but we're going to create a Sprint

350
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,680
plan around risk Guardian because it's

351
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,560
been deemed fairly important for the

352
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,560
business um and feature two is more

353
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,079
important uh than things that are not

354
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,720
featured to but risk Guardian also

355
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,199
important so I'm creating this filter uh

356
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,920
to see what it is we're going to take we

357
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,839
can take about 20 things into the Sprint

358
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,240
uh but we only really want to take maybe

359
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,319
five things um for our uh Sprint goal

360
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,839
which is going to be around feature two

361
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,519
and risk Ian we're going to create a

362
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,839
story around that so what I might do is

363
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,120
take a little look across these items

364
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,160
and say well this this item's great that

365
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,279
we're going to need to do that that's

366
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,680
going to come in and then we've got yeah

367
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,920
that's not as interesting that feature

368
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
one but it should really be part of this

369
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,199
even though feature 2 is currently more

370
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,720
important than feature one uh and this

371
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:23,639
one and this one so that's three need a

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,000
fourth one this one's not as useful yet

373
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,800
but this is much more useful so we're

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,959
going to take that one and now I can

375
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,560
drag these into the next Sprint there we

376
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,319
go they've all been assigned to that

377
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,839
Sprint you can see that in there um and

378
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:37,440
that's that's our plan we could have

379
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,920
done this in Sprint planning we could

380
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,319
have done this in refinement and then

381
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,519
we're going to review it in Sprint

382
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,480
planning like we're going to take about

383
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,279
20 things into this Sprint but here's

384
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,120
the five that we think are to do with

385
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,360
the next goal we might get more

386
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,720
information at the review but we can we

387
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,639
can we can adapt this this is not

388
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,839
setting Stone this is just a a best

389
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,199
guess at this moment in time what we

390
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,839
think would be a good idea here for

391
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,319
Sprint one as we get nearer to Sprint

392
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,640
one

393
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,039
starting so there I've been able to do

394
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,520
that with filtering so if I remove that

395
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:15,559
filter you'll see those Sprint one items

396
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,000
there are not next to each other in the

397
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,919
product backlog because we're using the

398
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,480
order of the product backlog to inform

399
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,959
but not control the contents of our

400
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,080
backlog with a focus on value and we

401
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,200
made the decision about what items we're

402
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:37,200
going to bring into the Sprint based on

403
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,000
multiple um vectors of information one

404
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,039
was the the the the projects right so

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,640
here I've got risk Guardian Insight

406
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,840
Ledger uh Unity Erp there are various

407
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,120
various maybe we're integrating into

408
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,640
other systems right um we've got various

409
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,280
projects that are going on that are

410
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,320
managed by other people we're delivering

411
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,480
um the value and we've got a bunch of

412
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
features

413
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,799
which are a different way of grouping

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,600
the contents not based on project um and

415
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,880
we actually have there's another Vector

416
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:14,039
in here that we didn't really talk about

417
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,320
um which is the stage of uh um each of

418
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,799
those uh pieces of work so what's what's

419
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,880
the main topic of those pieces of work

420
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,200
uh that is independent of feature and

421
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,360
independent of project uh going on

422
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,559
within the bounds of our product that

423
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,520
we're delivering here which looks like

424
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:37,480
an integration tool so hopefully this

425
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:41,320
was a useful view of um how we can move

426
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,840
away from a hierarchical work breakdown

427
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:49,240
structure towards something that is more

428
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:51,559
flexible that is more usable and more

429
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,240
effective if you are struggling to move

430
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:56,480
away from a Project based work breakdown

431
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,080
structure for visualizing your backlog

432
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,280
