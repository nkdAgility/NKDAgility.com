1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,120
hmm that's a good one what what would I

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,420
hope to achieve with a new scrum team in

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,100
the first 90 days uh 90 days should be

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,859
enough for everything that's that's

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,980
that's my my view

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,500
um it depends on where the team is and

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,300
where their organization is and what the

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,880
organizational constraints are going to

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,099
be because I'm sure there's

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,399
organizations I've gone in to help teams

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,079
with where there is very limited support

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,820
from the rest of the organization and

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,399
then you're working within that bounded

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,440
box right and you can poke at it but you

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,300
get limited ability to do that

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,539
but if you have

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,219
an open receptive organization an open

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,559
receptive leadership within the

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,780
organization you you you should be able

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,420
to take them from zero to a hundred in

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,600
in 90 days right they should be able to

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,660
go from from barely able to deliver

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,100
a working product or not delivering a

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,900
working product at the end of every

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,200
every Sprint

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,939
um to continuous continuous delivery in

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
that time that that that should be where

28
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,720
you want to get them that the the end of

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,460
that 90 days

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,759
um they are able to continuously deliver

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,799
a usable working product to production

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,259
separating out the ideas of release

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,759
right which is a business idea and

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,420
delivery which is an engineering

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,720
practice and enable the product owner to

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,700
um better represent the value right that

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,259
the business now have an understanding

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,700
of of uh the value or what value is for

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,680
them right because that's different for

40
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,600
every organization what valued means to

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,939
them so that you can then have rational

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,320
conversations with them about what

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,540
things are more important than other

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,560
things and why so that you have a

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,939
ordered backlog a direction a goal right

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,540
what is it we're trying to achieve

47
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,640
together and that then informs that

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,560
release side right what are we actually

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,299
going to ship you've got that

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,060
engineering side with the continuous

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,400
delivery of value to to to to to

52
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,260
production right continuously delivered

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
to production and then you mesh that

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,180
together then closing the feedback loop

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,900
right with learning so are you then able

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,000
to collect uh collect Telemetry and talk

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,920
to users and figure out whether you're

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,080
actually building the right thing or the

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,480
business value idea is actually correct

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,459
have you validated them and then close

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,620
that feedback loop all the way around to

62
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,780
change what it is we're working on based

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,540
on those things that we learned

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,739
that's that's kind of the minimum that I

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,080
would expect to get to in in 90 days and

66
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,560
then hopefully within those 90 days I

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,400
found somebody within that organization

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,620
who is able to be the champion for this

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,900
this process or everyone being the

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,540
champion for this process this new way

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,239
of working going forward so that at the

72
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,620
end of 90 days right I can I can back

73
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,900
off

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,360
um let them get on with it right they

75
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,379
they've built their their

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,540
um unique glove organizational structure

77
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,700
right that fits them like a glove that

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,900
they're then able to to take forward and

79
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,560
use

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,379
um and then perhaps be available to help

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,540
tweak coach answer questions and be

82
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,360
available after that but ultimately it's

83
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,519
it's it's their problem to solve it's

84
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,159
their work to do

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,780
um and if we can get them to a certain

86
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,120
place in the first 90 days that they

87
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,780
understand it then they should be able

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,780
to take it from there

89
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,780
