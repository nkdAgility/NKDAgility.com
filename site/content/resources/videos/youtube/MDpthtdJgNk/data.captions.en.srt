1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,160
I think caman is becoming popular in the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,920
creative Industries because there's very

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,679
little other help out there for for the

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,119
the creative type work where you're

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,920
you're for example building computer

6
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,080
games or you're building um uh uh uh

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,279
marketing content or you're building

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
videos whatever it is that you're

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,640
building that's not really software

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,760
engineering cuz everybody thinks of grum

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,040
as a software engineering

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,000
process and find it a little bit weird

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,360
trying to apply it within their context

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,559
right they actually they're actually

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,800
running into the same thing that

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,079
everybody runs into that doesn't that

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,520
would things don't work that way here so

18
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:54,199
caman is a much better uh starting point

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,960
um for getting into to making changes to

20
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,120
the way the way that you work and trying

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,039
to optimize your your

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,239
processes um so

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,400
so coming up with that definition of

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,520
workflow for your existing process is

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,640
usually much easier than trying to apply

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,880
something like scrum so for lots of

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,880
organizations they don't want that big

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,040
bang change right when you uh when you

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,079
apply something like scrum you're you're

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,479
you're making a leap from the way you

31
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,040
currently work and changing it to

32
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,520
something else and this is going to be

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,360
your starting point so that would be you

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,040
start at scrum and then you're going to

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,840
move forward from there and optimize

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,479
you're still going to use cban campan

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,119
strategy and you're going to optimize

38
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,560
from there but if your way of working

39
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,119
right now is kind of working and you

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
don't want to disrupt that too much or

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,240
you don't feel you don't know the if

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,880
you're going to get value from that

43
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,159
scrum thing then start from where you

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,079
are right that's that's the beauty of a

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,880
caman strategy is it doesn't care what

46
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,360
the it doesn't care the way your system

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,280
currently works you mod model your

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,159
existing system that's where you start

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,080
from so um you you you can take any

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
industry any system creative or

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,760
otherwise and you can just model your

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,319
existing system a a huge difficulty

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,400
though um I've worked in quite a few

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,040
creative uh I've worked in the creative

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
industry right uh when I when I first

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,480
started as a software engineer uh after

57
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,480
I graduated back in

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,319
2000 my first jobs were

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,879
um New Media

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,440
agencies um You probably wouldn't call

61
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,840
them that anymore but New Media agencies

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,800
I worked with a groups of designers

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,519
building flash applications uh flash

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,840
websites if anybody remembers flash if

65
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,920
not don't even look at it it's mental um

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,239
and th those those kind of thing working

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,000
with with the creative industry and it's

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,720
it's it is a very difficult space

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,040
because of the way art works right it's

70
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,519
very difficult to be iterative and

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,000
incremental right away in that in that

72
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,760
space because the way we traditionally

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,920
work with art is it's your personal

74
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,920
thing and your personal thing is going

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,799
to a certain point till you're

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,120
personally happy with it and then you're

77
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,640
you're you're providing it to other

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,239
other people to to to give you feedback

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,760
and and that kind of thing

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,720
so there's there's a much more personal

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
nature to that than there is in um in in

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,560
maybe other Industries like software

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
engineering right where where there's

84
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,480
less a little bit less personal it can

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,000
still be personal but a little bit less

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,080
personal so that that's why creative

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,239
Industries and creative folks um

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,760
struggle with uh something like scrum

89
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,519
because it it it talks about team it

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,079
doesn't talk about individual and

91
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,920
creativity is about the individual so

92
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,239
finding the balance in that and it's is

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,159
very standoffish so cand strategy but

94
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,519
the hardest part of a cand strategy at

95
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
least at the beginning is writing down

96
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,159
writing down your your your your

97
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,239
workflow right documenting your your

98
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,799
definition of workflow how are you going

99
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,359
to get five creative people in a room

100
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,440
and agree what your existing workflow is

101
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,880
um so that's going to be your first

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,440
struggle but caman is popular in

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,000
Creative Industries because it seems

104
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,120
like actually

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm I'm actually going to recant some of

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,360
that a little bit I think that caman is

107
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,639
popular in a lot of places where people

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,840
don't want to change and they see scrum

109
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,759
has a bunch of rules and caman doesn't

110
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,120
have a bunch of rules and they feel like

111
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,360
they can just put a board on the

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:58,160
wall call it caman and they're

113
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,360
done that's not caman having a board on

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,520
the wall and moving cards across it is

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,199
one very small part of camand maybe an

116
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,080
important part that visualization part

117
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:15,160
but have you taken the time to actually

118
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,560
Define your workflow to agree as a group

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,000
all the people working together that

120
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,840
this is how we are all going to act how

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,759
we're all going to make decisions in the

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,960
same way I I I doubt that happens in in

123
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,840
in most organizations have you agreed

124
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,759
what the working process limits are how

125
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,360
much work is going to sit in each column

126
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,240
if you don't have whip limits you ain't

127
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,479
got cban at all right so so sitting down

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,919
and agreeing that these this is this is

129
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,199
really hard stuff it's hard for a group

130
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,600
of people to get together and make these

131
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,720
decisions and come up with these

132
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,759
rationals it's just it's just hard I I I

133
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,960
do workshops with with with groups of

134
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,000
people talking about this stuff and you

135
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,960
can you can do a 4-Hour workshop with a

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,280
group of five or six people and not get

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,199
anywhere near a definition of workf

138
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,199
nowhere near and this is this is people

139
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,280
who largely agree on what it is they're

140
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,120
doing because the devil's in the details

141
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,039
right when you're when you're when

142
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,599
you've got you've got a bunch of work in

143
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,400
a pile and you need to start a new piece

144
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,800
of work how do you choose that piece of

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
work

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,080
how do you choose

147
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,479
it right we have to agree as a group how

148
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,800
we're going to choose it because this is

149
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,800
our system that we're all working

150
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,160
within so how who who's who's way of

151
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,280
choosing it do we pick right out of the

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,680
five different opinions on how they

153
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,520
select work well I like this type of

154
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,400
work so I'm going to take that no that's

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,599
not good enough that's not how you

156
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,879
optimize a system right that's not how

157
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,520
you optimize the flow of work through a

158
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,479
system what is the most valuable piece

159
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,400
of work to take next now that's an

160
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,080
interesting conversation and how do you

161
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,759
define value and does it matter whether

162
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,240
you as an individual are comfortable

163
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,680
with that piece of work or not right

164
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,199
that there's probably some yes some no

165
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,680
right within the bounds of that so so

166
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,240
making these agreements and writing them

167
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,879
down is very hard and although caman has

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,479
become popular particularly in the

169
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:35,759
creative industry I definitely feel

170
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:38,240
there's a lot of Can't Ban right that

171
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,199
they really don't want to do anything or

172
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,400
change anything or have anything imposed

173
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,639
upon them and their way of

174
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,960
working I know a lot of creatives

175
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:51,159
creatives are very much very much H my

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,120
way of working is the best for me that's

177
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,560
how my muse right um and that's

178
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,319
absolutely reasonable but we're all

179
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,120
working together within a business

180
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:08,319
driving a particular outcome and that

181
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:11,199
business needs to optimize the work in

182
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,360
order to maximize the return on

183
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,479
investment right so how much effort we

184
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,400
spend versus how much money we get and

185
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,759
yeah we we we need some level of

186
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,960
standardization and a core critical part

187
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,319
of caman is is defining that

188
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,599
standardization have personal caman if

189
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,880
you don't want to work together as a

190
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:36,000
team each individual has their own cbat

191
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,440
problem solved right everybody just

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,320
decides their own way of working their

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,120
own workflow as long as they Define it

194
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,080
they write it down they have the the the

195
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,160
visualization limit their work in

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,880
process personal caman there's a book on

197
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,240
called personal caman on personal caman

198
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:57,079

199
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,720
so I know cam man's getting popular uh

200
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:03,680
but please do look

201
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:07,200
at the cang guides right take a look at

202
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,600
the cang guides look at what is actually

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,240
involved in creating a c a caman or

204
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,399
using a cand strategy against your work

205
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,279
and usually there's there's there's more

206
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,440
rigor more effort more ambiguity and

207
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,120
more difficulty than something like

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,200
scrum if your current system of work is

209
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,839
