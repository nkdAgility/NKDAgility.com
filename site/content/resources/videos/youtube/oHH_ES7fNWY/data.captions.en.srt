1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,400
I'm going to configure uh the release

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,440
management system to send emails um but

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,920
my mail server is Office

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,920
365 so if I open up uh release

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,640
management click on

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,680
Administration and then click on the

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,640
settings uh uh option right at the very

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,279
end you'll see I've got a number of uh

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,079
configuration options here but I've got

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,680
my smt P server

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,960
configuration and now the way I'm

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,120
configuring it is I'm using outlook.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,480
office365.com on Port

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,120
995 I've got my uh username in there

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,760
entered my password and the sender

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,480
address um now Martin nn.com is

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,440
authorized to send uh info so that

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,039
should work you may want to set up a

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,640
mailbox specifically for your account um

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,440
and that would obviously make things a

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,160
little bit more um

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,199
uh generic but you can do that now where

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,600
do you get these Account Details from

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,360
well you need to open up your browser

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,960
log to

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,960
your office.

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,119
microsoft.com if I sign

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,200

email

31
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,680
and this is my organizational

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,479
account that is okay now if I go to my

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,399
Outlook address Outlook

34
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:56,200

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,200
go down to

36
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,840
options now that we are in options um if
