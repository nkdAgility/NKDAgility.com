I'm going to configure the release management system to send emails, but my mail server is Office 365. 

If I open up release management, click on Administration and then click on the settings option right at the very end, you'll see I've got a number of configuration options here, but I've got my SMTP server configuration. 

Now the way I'm configuring it is I'm using outlook.office365.com on Port 995. I've got my username in there, entered my password and the sender address. Now Martin nn.com is authorized to send info, so that should work. You may want to set up a mailbox specifically for your account, and that would obviously make things a little bit more generic, but you can do that. 

Now, where do you get these account details from? Well, you need to open up your browser, log to your office.microsoft.com. If I sign in... Oh, wrong email. 

And this is my organisational account. That is okay. Now if I go to my Outlook address, Outlook app, and then if I click on the Cog and go down to options. 

Now that we are in options, if you scroll down to the bottom, you'll see settings for pop or IMAP access. If you click that, you will get your pop and IMAP connection details, and you can use that to configure release management as I did here.
