One of the great parts of immersive learning is getting feedback from your peers and colleagues. We give an assignment at the end of every session, something to do in your organisation to actually practically implement some of the techniques. And when we come back, we do a debrief, but it's a facilitated debrief. So it's not just myself or one of the other trainers doing the debrief; it's your colleagues in the class, the other people that are participating, who've also tried the same thing. They're providing their input, their review, their reflections on what you've tried, and you can provide it on what they've tried. And hopefully, we can build a much bigger body of experiential knowledge.
