1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,440
one of the great parts of immersive

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,600
learning is getting feedback from your

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,639
peers and colleagues we give an

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,160
assignment at the end of every session

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,320
uh something to do in your organization

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,559
to actually practically Implement some

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,240
of the techniques and when we come back

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,279
we do a debrief but it's a a facilitated

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,039
debrief so it's not just myself or one

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,359
of the other trainers doing the debrief

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,000
it's your colleagues in the class the

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,040
other people that are participating

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,320
who've also tried the same thing they're

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,559
providing their input their review their

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,120
Reflections on what you've tried and you

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,520
can provide it on what they've tried and

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,640
hopefully we can build a much bigger

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,640
body of experiential knowledge
