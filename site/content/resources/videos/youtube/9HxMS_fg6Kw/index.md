# What are some big red flags when hiring an agile consultant?

Embarking on an #agiletransformation where you shift from traditional #projectmanagement models, tools, and methodologies to an #agile approach can be incredibly tough.

You're shifting from a rigid, robust methodology that contains a myriad of rules, prescribed steps, and a culture of command and control to something based on values and principles. 

Something that provides a lightweight #agileframework to foster creativity, innovation, and collaboration but doesn't tell you explicitly what to do, how to do it, and when to do it.

Many organizations turn to an #agileconsultant or #agilecoach to help them with the transition, and rely heavily on that individual for guidance, insight, and recommendations. It requires a lot of trust and there is a great deal at stake for the #leadership teams making those calls.

So, how do you know whether you have the right #agileconsultant in your camp? How do you know whether the person you are hiring is capable of helping you navigate through quicksand and build #agile capability?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about some of the big red flags that will warn you that the person you are dealing with is maybe not the best choice to help you lead that #agiletransformation
