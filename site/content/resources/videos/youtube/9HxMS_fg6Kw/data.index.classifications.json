    "reasoning": "The content discusses the importance of being part of the agile community and articulating core agile concepts, which indirectly relates to Scrum principles. However, it primarily focuses on hiring practices for agile consultants rather than the Scrum framework itself. While there are mentions of the Scrum Guide and agile principles, the depth of discussion on Scrum-specific roles, events, or artifacts is minimal, leading to a moderate confidence score.",
