1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,380
so what a question was what are the red

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
flags

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,719
to look for with wearing an agile

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,300
consultant

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,779
I think

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,180
the biggest red flags

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,000
for me

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,580
um are

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,820
not not not not engaging in the

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,140
community not being part of

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,399
um some

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,800
some some group or Community or effort

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,579
where they're sharing their ideas with

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,700
others they're having ideas of others

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,960
shared with them and working in that

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,079
kind of Melting Pot there's nothing

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
nothing better than being part of a an

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,379
agile community and which I'm part part

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
of a few and seeing something and you

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,960
immediately get piled on for saying

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,799
something so ridiculous

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,640
that

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,260
um

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,360
it's not really people aren't

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,040
deliberately piling on you right because

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,340
they're they're agile it's just you know

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,960
you you send them a message and all of

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,460
them are writing a response at the same

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,799
time because you've poked at something

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,840
that that that maybe wasn't the best

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,640
thing to pull cat and and that gives you

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,799
I don't know what the right word is is

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,299
it is it is it humility for for

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,220
you're not always going to say the right

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,920
thing you're not always going to be able

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,220
to do the right thing you're you're

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,000
going to say stupid stuff

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,820
and you have to be able to take being

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,979
called on saying stupid stuff

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,299
and sometimes it's okay to say stupid

41
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,619
stuff because if you don't say what

42
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,020
you're thinking if you don't feel safe

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,540
enough to say what you're thinking

44
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,640
um how would you possibly

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,280
be able to learn

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,960
that there might be a different way of

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,299
thinking and I think that's that's one

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,060
of the key things because I there's so

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,459
many consultants are not

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,959
part of any agile Community they just

51
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,660
have that Echo chamber of their

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,920
organization or their consultancy and

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,379
there's not anything more information

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,540
coming in

55
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:24,660
from outside that

56
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,700
um having having discourse

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,580
right being able to articulate

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,180
the the the the the the the Core

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,160
Concepts in agile so I'm thinking

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,220
empiricism

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,260
I'm thinking uh lean

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,180
um I'm you need to be able to

63
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,360
articulate them in a way

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,819
that they are able to be understood by

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
the other person within the context of

66
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,860
that other person rather than just

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:04,260
regurgitating something from the scrum

68
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,920
guide say that says well XYZ right

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,319
um

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,900
you need to be able to say

71
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,640
well you know the scrum guide says this

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,800
because it's trying to achieve this idea

73
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,879
if you can achieve this idea in a

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,700
different way inside of your

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,159
organization then maybe that's okay

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,840
being able to articulate those things

77
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,340
I think that's that's key so that's just

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,519
a fundamental lack of knowledge right

79
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,459
that's that's really it I think I think

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,400
it's actually true in in in all

81
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,080
consultancies

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,640
but I'm going to be very specific here

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,220
because otherwise I'm going to piss off

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,799
everybody right but you there's a

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,220
difference between a boutique

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,739
consultancy which specializes in a

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,319
particular topic

88
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:55,019
hires people who are experts known

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,239
experts in that particular topic and

90
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,280
encourages them to become better experts

91
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,840
in that particular topic

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,819
and our our butts in seats

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,620
Contracting

94
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,920
consultancy

95
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,299
who are really only interested in how

96
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,500
much money they can make out of the

97
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,340
customer

98
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,079
so they they get into this vicious cycle

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,239
right this is the thing to watch out for

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,940
in in in in consultancies as you get

101
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,440
into this vicious cycle of

102
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,900
um

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,699
in order to stay afloat we need to win

104
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,960
more business right we're the

105
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,479
Consultants say we need to win more

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,100
business because we've got people that

107
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,360
are that are in the company that need

108
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,740
the work

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,540
and then you you have experts and you

110
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,400
have all of these high ideals with the

111
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,259
customer so lots of customers buy your

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,960
stuff and suddenly you don't have enough

113
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,639
people on the bench to service the gigs

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
that are coming in right the gigs in

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,620
your pipeline so then you have to go

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,360
find people who can do those gigs but we

117
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,320
can't wait for those people we need them

118
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
now

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
so we're taking the people that are

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
available not the people that are right

121
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,220
for that gig they're not bringing in

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,300
people because their Knowledge and

123
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,120
Skills they're bringing in people

124
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,880
because of their availability

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,620
um and and then you get into that

126
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,639
vicious cycle of then now we've get more

127
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,860
people

128
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,320
and uh they roll off a gig onto the

129
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,860
bench and we need to sell more to get

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,520
more stuff rather than

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,680
I mean we it's it's even more

132
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,220
it's even worse for an agile consultancy

133
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,919
not to do this but having a lean

134
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,080
Outlook right you don't take on more

135
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,020
work than you can handle

136
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,639
um you you limit your work in process so

137
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,680
that you're playing the long game not

138
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,240
the short game of Revenue extraction but

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,500
the long game of value creation and

140
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,759
building relationships with your

141
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
customers

142
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,060
um and not pissing them off and then we

143
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,759
have to get new customers

144
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,900
so for me those are the big

145
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,800
the two big pieces is the actual

146
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,180
individuals and the knowledge and

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,940
capability that they have to understand

148
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,039
agile articulator explain it and and

149
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,740
work with it and work with other people

150
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,979
in the agile space

151
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,919
and that bigger consultancy model

152
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,620
um of the the I call it the death spiral

153
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,620
right because there's there's no way out

154
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,759
of that if all you're focused on is I I

155
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,680
need bots in uh uh Revenue extraction

156
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,520
mode then

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,520
you're not gonna

158
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,759
you're not gonna you're not gonna serve

159
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,440
your customers right

160
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,440
for me that's the two big things
