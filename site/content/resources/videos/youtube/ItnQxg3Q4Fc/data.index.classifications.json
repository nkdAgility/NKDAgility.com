    "reasoning": "The content discusses the importance of senior leadership engagement in agile transformations, which indirectly relates to Scrum principles, particularly in terms of team dynamics and continuous improvement. However, it lacks direct references to specific Scrum roles, events, or artifacts, and does not delve deeply into Scrum practices. The mention of 'agile' and 'scrum' at the end is brief and does not constitute a primary focus on Scrum itself.",
