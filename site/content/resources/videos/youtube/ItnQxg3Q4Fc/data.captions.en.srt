1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,480
so the the question is why is it so

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,000
important that senior leadership teams

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,559
are engaged during an agile Consulting

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,320
engagement

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,660
um and I guess

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,480
it really it really it really depends on

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,500
what systemic change you're you're what

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,779
you're wanting to get in the

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,039
organization are you actually looking to

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:32,460
transition towards a more a business

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,620
that is faster at reacting to changing

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,880
market demand that that's that's

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,579
effectively what we're talking about

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,320
right and if we're talking about I mean

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,000
often quite I come into organizations

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,280
and we're talking to engineering teams

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,820
about how they can do that

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,520
but can you imagine a circumstance

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,860
where I could talk to anybody any team

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,640
anywhere in any organization in the

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,039
world

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,039
and talk about

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,340
them getting faster feedback from their

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,500
customers to enable a greater degree of

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,439
adaptability to what their customers

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,820
need and we're not gonna have to have a

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,020
conversation with the business right

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,760
we're not going to have to have a

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,799
conversation with leadership it just

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,659
doesn't exist right that's those

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,760
circumstances where you just know

32
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,439
they're not actually going to be able to

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,180
get the things that they're looking for

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,159
and you're gonna have to figure out a

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,740
way for them to get the best they can

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,360
within the bounds of the constrained

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,680
system because leadership's not involved

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,140
and not interested

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,119
the the only way you can transition

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,060
towards

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,400
um that that faster Market engagement

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,140
which is the purpose of agile right it's

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,420
just a tool to help us get there a

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,759
philosophy to help us get there

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,340
um is is to have everybody in the

46
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,619
organization change

47
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,439
participate and be willing to change

48
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,899
potentially any business practice in the

49
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,600
business in order to help us get there

50
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,640
and if leadership's not involved all of

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,159
those things are off the table

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,780
um so quite often I and I've done this

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,380
in organizations where I've only been

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,300
involved at the the team level I've just

55
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,940
asked where's the CEO's office and gone

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,879
and knocked on a door right and and said

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,280
look can we have a chat about what it is

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,459
I'm doing and what I think you need to

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,160
be involved in understand and help with

60
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,680
um actually CFOs are way better

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,200
right CFOs are way better if you if you

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,379
get the the the the the person with the

63
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,800
money on board who who signs the checks

64
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,379
and decides how money's spent uh then

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,900
you're you're totally rocking in that uh

66
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,940
at that space because who wouldn't want

67
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,860
to optimize

68
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,900
the value that you get from the money

69
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,220
you put in right who better to

70
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
understand that than somebody somebody

71
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,879
who's fiscally minded

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,500
um hopefully CEOs are fiscilla-minded as

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,780
well but you know what I mean

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,400
um and I think that's that's why it's so

75
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,920
important for

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,260
um senior leadership and this affects

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,000
the entire organization there's a great

78
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,959
example of this

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,580
um your devops team at Microsoft

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,260
um adopted agility

81
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,599
if you don't know I've got some videos

82
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,000
and posts about it

83
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,620
um but they they they they changed the

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,720
entire way they do business and when

85
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,120
they were asked right what did they have

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
to change the answer is everything

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,420
we had to change the way we sell the

88
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,980
product we had to change the way we

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,659
Market the product we had to change the

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,099
way we build the product we had to

91
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,440
change the way

92
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,360
um our our parts of our business operate

93
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,879
we had to change the way we engage with

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,900
stakeholders we had to change everything

95
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,000
about how they did business in order to

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,159
get to the point where they were able to

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,200
continuously deliver valuable usable

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,360
product to the customer get the feedback

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,159
and have the autonomy to be able to make

100
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,900
the decisions on what they focus on and

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,519
what they need to build and how they're

102
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,620
spending money right pushing that

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,239
responsibility down the organization and

104
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,659
that's super hard

105
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,000
you need a senior leadership involved

106
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,840
you need to have

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,659
um

108
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
align all the way up the organization to

109
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,239
the to as high as you can possibly go

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,280
ideally the very top uh to be able to

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,260
get the

112
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,940
I'm gonna say permission right because

113
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,820
in a lot of organizations you don't have

114
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,979
permission but for to to be able to get

115
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,720
the permission that you need in order to

116
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,919
make the changes that are going to best

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
benefit the organization
