1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,420
so what is the most common common

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,860
Epiphany in the psm2 course I think it I

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,480
think there's more than one and I think

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,940
it depends what level you're playing at

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,220
when you come into the class

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,660
um which Epiphany you get

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,720
so

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,519
the probably the the the most

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,560
the biggest Epiphany is the the

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,020
realization that the scrum Master is not

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,180
just focused on the team right that's

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,700
that's the big Epiphany for for most

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,980
folks because I think

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,160
even though it's very explicit in the

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,840
scrum guide it absolutely States here's

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,879
the scrum Master's accountability to the

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,260
team and here's the accountability of

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,879
the product owner and here's the

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,200
accountability to the to the

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,600
organization

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,460
most people seem to forget or kind of

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,739
gloss over that bit for the

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
accountability for the organization and

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,400
when we start

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,939
kind of double clicking on that and

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
expanding it and figuring out

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,780
um

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,200
what the implications are of those

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,060
accountabilities for how the scrum

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,900
Master

31
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,060
purports themselves within the

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,360
organization I think I think it changes

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,020
that Dynamic it expands those ideas and

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,520
they really have that realization

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,860
um that they perhaps need to be doing

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
more that they need to be poking at some

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,180
of those asking asking difficult

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,880
questions right that that's something

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,040
that I I find is very important as a

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,100
scrum master and even if all that

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,780
difficult question is is why right

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,759
um something happens a particular way in

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,600
the organization is getting in the way

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,579
of the team why right because you do

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,920
find depending on the organization that

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,299
there can be rules in place that are

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,020
ancient rules

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,720
right I I I did been doing a little bit

49
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,979
of uh digging recently on um Royal Bank

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,500
of Scotland

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,860
and they have these these these rules in

52
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,200
place for how their teams work

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,080
but there are there are 200 plus year

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,040
old bank right there's rules in place

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,500
because they were a great rule 100 years

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,700
ago for whatever context they were

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,860
created in

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,599
but are they still relevant today that's

59
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,180
kind of like your organizational package

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,879
and your organizational craft and who's

61
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,200
going to take care of that who who looks

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,420
at that craft so I think that that's

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,340
that's one of the big epiphanies

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,000
um at that level and then there's the

65
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,180
meta Epiphany in the PSM 2 that I think

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
is really important for those people in

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,440
the room that are also facilitators so

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,019
they kind of get a double Epiphany and

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,080
that's that that

70
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:56,819
how to engage with people and have more

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,220
people participate in the discussions

72
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,959
like have a two-dimensional scrum Master

73
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,760
right how to become a two-dimensional

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
scrum Master rather than that

75
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,660
one-dimensional of just looking at scrum

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,300
how do I start bringing in additional

77
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,640
tools and practices in the way that they

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,940
do things and demonstrate their own

79
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,140
behavior in order to to to facilitate

80
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,200
change

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,319
um of the people and and and and

82
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,300
