# What is the most common epiphany in a PSM II course?

The #PSMII or #advancedprofessionalscrummaster course from #scrumorg has been created to elevate the skills, competence, and capability of a #scrummaster from basic to advanced level.

It's a skills development and validation certification that is designed to equip a #scrummaster with the competencies and capabilities necessary to serve the #scrumteam, #productowner, and organization effectively in a complex #agile #productdevelopment environment.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood - #professionalscrumtrainer - talks about the most common epiphanies experienced on the PSM II course and why is has such an impact on #scrummasters.
