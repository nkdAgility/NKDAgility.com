1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,759
when I'm talking about evidence-based

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:10,040
management I generally talk about four

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,440
key value areas with specific metrics in

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,280
those areas the reason I talk about 4

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:19,880
key value areas is because they cover

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:23,080
different aspects of um our holistic

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,439
system view right rather than a a

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,000
suboptimization um a suboptimal

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,920
optimization at a at a single level we

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,160
want to ensure that we have metrics in

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,680
in all of those key value areas and the

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,760
key value areas the four key value areas

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,480
in scrum the orgs evidence-based

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,920
management guide um is kind of broken

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,480
into two categories so there's two key

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,360
value areas in each of the

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,879
categories um the one that is more

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,039
business

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,879
focused is the market value so we need

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,280
to if we have a product and we're trying

21
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,840
to um we're building a software product

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,520
and we're trying to get it into the

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:12,680
market there are two places we have to

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:15,960
look for where our value is one is um

25
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,040
the current value of our product right

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,759
that's the product that already exists

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
potentially right if we don't have a

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,840
product that exists yet that one maybe

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,200
doesn't have any metrics yet um but if

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,880
we do have a product and it exists and

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,720
we've got it in front of of real

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,680
users then we want to think about what

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,399
our current value is and how do we

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,560
measure our current value the value we

35
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,600
have in the system right now so I might

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,880
have

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,719
Telemetry in fact don't might just do it

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,200
get Telemetry on your product if you're

39
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,280
a product manager and you manage a

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,360
software product you should have access

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,719
to Telemetry that shows you what

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,119
features in the product are used how

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,920
often they're used which users and which

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
of your customers if you've got bigger

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880
customers which of them use those

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,840
features right that's part of your

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,239
evidence-based decision-making process

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,440
um but also are your customers satisfied

49
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
with your product right are they

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,640
actually satisfied so you could do that

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,720
with surveys that's a very lagging one

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,120
Telemetry is almost immediate real you

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
could have real time Telemetry um on

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
what's going on in your product or near

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,480
real time right and that's us

56
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,640
understanding our current value the

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
product we have in the market right now

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,599
and it could be how much money we're

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,280
making from it right now is also part of

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,640
that or Revenue by employee or you could

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,080
there's a bunch of metrics you can use

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,640
in that current value

63
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,959
space um but then we've got this idea of

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,680
unrealized value that's value that could

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,400
be in our products that isn't yet

66
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,760
um we store a list of the things that

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,360
we're going to go build in our product

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,640
backlog so that's part of the story is

69
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,519
your product backlog um but also you're

70
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,319
probably looking at market analysis

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,680
competitor analysis you're probably

72
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,239
looking at industry

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,200
Trends um to figure out where how can we

74
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,440
open out new markets for our product

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,680
right that unrealized value piece is

76
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,439
actually

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:36,519
the the scenario I I I like to use

78
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:39,920
for um market value is why

79
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,920
um TV

80
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:50,200
showmakers generally prefer to invest in

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:54,560
a new show brand new series than to add

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,959
a another season to an existing Series

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,480
right and the

84
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:05,439
reason is that a second season to an

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,840
existing series is almost never going to

86
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,760
have a higher audience never almost

87
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,159
never going to have more your first

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,760
season is your maximum amount of

89
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,759
audience and then over time it's going

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,519
to dip and how good the show continues

91
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,240
to be will be you know either be a oh

92
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,880
holy moly that's that's bad or you know

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,160
it's a slow decline over time and that's

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,840
why you have shows like um Halo uh which

95
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,720
was just cancelled the new Halo show

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
which H uh it showed a steep decline in

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,479
the second season so they're not going

98
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,240
to do a third or you think of another

99
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:48,639
show I think it's cable and wireless um

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,400
which was Supernatural which went for 16

101
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,440
16 Seasons 16 years uh before they

102
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,120
finally brought it to an end and that's

103
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,320
because that that line is is declining

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,639
but it's declining at a slower Cas so

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,800
there's still enough money to be made to

106
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,440
make it worth investing in that in that

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,400
in that show um but if we do something

108
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,199
brand new that the audience has never

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,520
heard of that doesn't know whether it's

110
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,440
good or bad right uh then we can we can

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,520
we can

112
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,400
just open out that new market that new

113
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,800
group of people and bring it into seeing

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,400
seeing that show so you're more likely

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,039
to have a higher audience for a new

116
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,720
thing than you are for adding features

117
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,280
to an existing thing that existing

118
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,520
people use because existing people are

119
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,440
the ones that are caring about it you're

120
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,960
already shortening your audience and the

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,120
same is true for features in your

122
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,680
product right whenever you add a net new

123
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
feature to your product um that's you

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,039
opening out new markets New

125
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,919
Opportunities new capabilities for your

126
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,960
customers brand new capabilities that

127
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,680
will hopefully be able to bring in new

128
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,720
customers that you didn't have before or

129
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,759
even whole new segments of customers

130
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,440
that you didn't have before into your

131
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,039
into your story

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,479
um but

133
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:13,080
H that that that takes a lot of effort

134
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,400
and focus and data and Analysis right

135
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,840
and trying stuff experimentation

136
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,560
hypothesis driven engineering practices

137
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,000
sit in that space where where we're

138
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,280
going to keep trying new stuff to

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,919
re-engage or engage re-engage with users

140
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
um in that that unrealized value space

141
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,599
so that that's our market value at the

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
top um that's the focus of I mean it's

143
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,520
the focus of

144
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,479
everybody right let's let's be clear

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,440
that we want to have as many product

146
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,800
developers as developers in our team um

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,680
and not

148
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,280
just jobbers doing the job right product

149
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,400
we're looking at how do we all work

150
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,800
together to make this products a

151
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,080
success um we need experts as well that

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,280
maybe don't care about that stuff they

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,080
care about their piece but we want at

154
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,639
least some of this but that's where

155
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,560
product ownership kind of sits right uh

156
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,800
in the in the scrum world is focusing on

157
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,120
unrealized value and current value the

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,800
market value and then up into the rest

159
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,440
of the business so product management

160
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
sits in that space and hopefully we have

161
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
some product management skills in the

162
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,240
developers on the team product

163
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,039
developers we have a good product owner

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,360
who is a product manager who has

165
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,039
understand scrum and we have other

166
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,800
people in the organization also looking

167
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,800
at this you might have marketing that's

168
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,960
people from with a marketing skill set

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,039
that's looking at this people from a

170
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,960
sales skill set that's looking at this

171
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,440
and all working together to start

172
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,879
funneling features and capability and

173
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,800
ideas into what are we going to do do in

174
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,800
this

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,080
product that's market value the other

176
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,599
piece is organizational capability

177
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,720
this is the piece that

178
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,319
um if you're on an engineering team you

179
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,560
lead an engineering team or you're part

180
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,080
of an engineering organization this is

181
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,479
the piece that you have 100% control

182
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:22,520
over right there are no excuses in this

183
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:26,560
space it's all you it's all you and that

184
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,680
those two key value areas are ability to

185
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,120
innovate right so ability to innovate is

186
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,279
about um how much Focus how much time

187
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,760
how much effort do we spend innovating

188
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,360
net new functionality right how much

189
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,480
time do we spend on that net new

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,680
functionality versus on the other stuff

191
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,959
that we have to do that we do have to do

192
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,200
right we have to do a lot of other stuff

193
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,560
as well but are we maximizing the amount

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,160
of time um we we are able to spend on

195
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,079
that and minimizing the amount of time

196
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
that we spend struggling with complexity

197
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:03,160
right so technical debts in that space

198
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,839
of ability to innovate any technical

199
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,000
debt is going to reduce your ability to

200
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,360
innovate any undone work is going to

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,440
reduce your ability to innovate anything

202
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
that is slow is going to reduce your

203
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,640
ability to innovate right you we have to

204
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,560
spend time on the slow stuff rather than

205
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,720
the fast up um and then the other side

206
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,800
of that is time to

207
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,640
Market time to Market is uh how quickly

208
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,839
can we go from that change we've made

209
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,399
all the way to production so those two

210
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,399
make up organizational capability and we

211
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:37,640
need to measure them as well so our

212
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,720
ability to innovate uh can be measured

213
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,760
in in lots of different ways I actually

214
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,760
I have some I have some metrics examples

215
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,320
uh that I can use over here ability to

216
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,000
innovate has loads and loads of metrics

217
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,120
uh I generally um my background is

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,880
engineering so uh my list is going to be

219
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:03,200
a little bit engineering focused uh but

220
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:05,399
if we're building a product that has um

221
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,440
customers that take versions of our

222
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,800
product either because we run private

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,279
Cloud for them right private instances

224
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,000
um and we don't continuously update it

225
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,760
they choose to take a version of the

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,680
product or because we're building

227
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,440
something that people install right they

228
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,399
either install it on their their phone

229
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,560
their desktop their their

230
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:32,839
environment I probably um want to be

231
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,480
looking at our uh

232
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:40,880
um percentage of people that are on the

233
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:45,399
current version of our product right um

234
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,880
I probably want to be looking at our um

235
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,519
time spent merging code between branches

236
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,720
right how much time do we spend on that

237
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,600
if you've got a branch branching policy

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,399
usually that's H if you if you promote

239
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,680
by environment this is really old school

240
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,800
devops right but if you promote by

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:09,600
environment H Dev Hua uh uh uh staging

242
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,680
production right so normally it's four

243
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,480
environments and you promote by

244
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,279
environment I.E you're merging code

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,240
between those those actual versions of

246
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,160
your code that are then deployed to

247
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
physical environments that's really old

248
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,959
school by the way don't do that anymore

249
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,279
um but if you're in that world then we

250
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,399
might want to measure the amount of time

251
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,760
we spend merging the code between

252
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
branches

253
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,200
right um yeah that that's that could be

254
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,920
a lot of time I I worked with an

255
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:42,680
organization a few years ago that had 90

256
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,079
teams in 13 locations uh in nine

257
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,800
different countries I think they know

258
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,920
who they are when I describe that um but

259
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,240
they they had a single product that had

260
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,160
90 90 odd teams working on it 90 odd

261
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,320
active branches um and then merging that

262
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,680
down and creating a unified product was

263
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,360
was a lot of work and a lot of effort a

264
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,040
lot of work and a lot of effort um so

265
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,440
getting a new version of your product

266
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,760
was was was was difficult right ensuring

267
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,199
that everything works together ensuring

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,600
that all of those things work well so

269
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:20,279
that could be um something you measure

270
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,199
so installed version index uh time spent

271
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,600
merging codes at production incident

272
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,199
count how many incidents are you having

273
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
in production because if we're

274
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:32,160
innovating and we're shipping

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,800
pad quality code then we're going to

276
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,399
have a higher level of instance in

277
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,240
production right so we need to have both

278
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,800
positive and negative measures like

279
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,320
we're doing the Innovation really well

280
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,720
yeah but we're delivering crap to

281
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,959
production okay well we need to fix that

282
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,160
that's not going to um help ensure that

283
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,959
our customers are happy with us on the

284
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,959
top side of that story right um but

285
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:59,279
probably the the the the the biggest

286
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:02,040
ones in there are um the two biggest

287
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,839
ones that that I think are easiest to

288
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,440
collect from a data perspective are

289
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,160
Innovation rate uh so what percentage of

290
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,480
your time do you spend on net new

291
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,360
functionality uh versus maintenance

292
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,199
versus support right um this is the

293
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,199
age-old capex versus Opex uh uh

294
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,800
conversation or can be right depending

295
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:25,040
on on on your product and your

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,760
organization um so how much time do you

297
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,480
spend on on on those things obviously

298
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,800
you want to be spending more time on

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,959
capital expenditure because it's taxed

300
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
differently anyway right that's that's

301
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,600
from a financial perspective that's a

302
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:44,240
good idea but also um we want

303
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,399
to the the capital expenditure investing

304
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,440
in our products future and new features

305
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,600
and new

306
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,360
capabilities is

307
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,839
um the thing that's going to bring in

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,279
net new users which is hopefully going

309
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,680
to translate to to to to revenue so we

310
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,320
want to be looking at Innovation rate

311
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,000
that's that's a big part of the story

312
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
and the other one that I like to look at

313
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,240
is technical debt technical debt is

314
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:14,440
really important um I generally use

315
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,079
sonar um sonar Cube to do that you can

316
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,160
do on prime or you can use their Cloud

317
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,560
version if you're open source it's free

318
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,839
if you're not open source you have to

319
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:28,000
pay right but sonar sonar Cube looks at

320
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,279
code bases using industry standards and

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,279
recognize industry standard metrics for

322
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:37,079
technical debt um it looks for known

323
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,519
code flaws right so there are there are

324
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,079
constructs that people create in

325
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,519
specific languages let's I write in C

326
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,240
right so or parach but if I'm writing in

327
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,839
C and I run sonar Cube against it and it

328
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,880
tells me here's a whole bunch of

329
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,600
security problems you have in your code

330
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
I should really go fix them right

331
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,639
they're

332
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,720
potentials known potentials at least

333
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,839
don't have known potentials for for

334
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,720
vector for attack right um there will be

335
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,320
other vectors that you don't know about

336
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,639
but at least don't have the ones you do

337
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,560
know about it could have code smells

338
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,160
right things that are just constructed

339
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,680
in a way that means it will be more

340
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,360
difficult to maintain and support these

341
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,959
are things that we can fix that we can

342
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,000
monitor and we can fix uh when you do

343
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,399
run it first it's going to look nasty

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,199
it's going to find like 6,000 things

345
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,800
that are a problem um but if you have a

346
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,959
policy of leaving any code a little bit

347
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,920
better than you found it then if you're

348
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,519
going to edit some code look up the

349
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,319
metrics for that part of the code base

350
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:42,079
fix any of those problems then make

351
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,800
changes to the code then uh uh uh

352
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,160
revalidate and you should find that it

353
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,440
gets a little bit better over time

354
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,800
that's that's just policies and and and

355
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,759
procedures for the team right make

356
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,920
things a little bit better um so that

357
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,480
technical debt is super important and

358
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,680
it's much easier to collect than you

359
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,880
think uh you just apply sonar Cube but

360
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,680
it's really hard to do something with it

361
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,360
um there's definitely a human thing that

362
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,199
when we see 5,000 things dumped on us

363
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,199
that your thing's rubbish we we get

364
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:17,720
dejected I think that's the right word

365
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,199
unhappy um with that and then let ignore

366
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,639
that right instead uh so that's that's

367
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,600
really important ability to innovate is

368
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,160
one of our key stories here and but the

369
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,360
other one is time to Market

370
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,480
time to Market is about how quickly we

371
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,880
get our product into production um good

372
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:43,519
examples or in the industry of fast time

373
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,600
to Market are things like Facebook 12

374
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,360
and a half minutes from developer code

375
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,000
commit to production 12 and a half

376
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,079
minutes that's including all testing and

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,440
load testing and stress testing and all

378
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:59,959
those kind of things that's super quick

379
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,040
right um uh Starbucks um at least when I

380
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,480
company I worked for engaged with them

381
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:10,120
back

382
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:12,760
uh 13 years ago is um they had decided

383
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,360
that their effective planning Horizon

384
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,520
I.E time to Market effective planning

385
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,600
Horizon for for for changes they needed

386
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,919
to get was 48 hours so from um

387
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,760
implementing a thing that they wanted to

388
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,439
get out into production to actually

389
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,679
being out in production they wanted to

390
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,080
be 48 hours that was a business decision

391
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:38,080
right um another one is and this this

392
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,520
one's a little bit more it could be um

393
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,200
what's it called when it's uh not

394
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:49,320
uh like a tail rather than rather than

395
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,360
reality uh but I heard tell that it's

396
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,159
not my experience but I heard tell that

397
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,159
when um after Windows Vista quality

398
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,600
debacle fixed in Windows 7 and then the

399
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:06,159
Windows 8 usability debacle fixed in

400
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,640
Windows 8.1 a year later um that Satia

401
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:12,679
the CEO of Microsoft reasonably new to

402
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,480
it at the time went down to that H Team

403
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,200
the windows team which is like four and

404
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,799
a half th000 software Engineers cutting

405
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,400
code every day right so it's just a lot

406
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,440
of people um and basically said to

407
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,720
leadership that we've taken a business

408
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,240
decision we want to see working copies

409
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,120
of windows in the hands of real us users

410
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,640
at least every 30

411
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,880
days um we want it rolled out to

412
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,799
everybody in the world at least every 90

413
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,400
days and they said that's impossible you

414
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,039
can't do that and he said it's not my

415
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,760
problem that's a engineering problem

416
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,360
this is a business decision your job is

417
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,280
to make it happen go figure it out um

418
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,799
and that business decision is what

419
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:59,400
birthed Windows 10 and that new release

420
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,840
Cadence and that now the ability

421
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,159
the the the they're less than 24 hours

422
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:10,080
from code to production inside of

423
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,280
Microsoft uh a week to production for

424
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,880
what is it 17 million people in the

425
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,919
Insiders program um and then every three

426
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,480
months they do that big ship to

427
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,640
everybody in the world the 950 million

428
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,919
other people that are that are using

429
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,760
Windows um so that that Cadence means

430
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,039
that you need a higher quality on a

431
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,919
daily basis so time to market we've got

432
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,840
the technical debt story on the other

433
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,760
side um but the time to Market story

434
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,720
brings in things like cycle time release

435
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,760
frequency how often you release I think

436
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,120
um uh back in

437
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,360
2012 is 20 let's call it 2010 probably

438
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,840
to be safe um you could probably count

439
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,240
on both hands the the releases for major

440
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
in fact you count on one hand the

441
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,919
releases for major software products

442
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,120
from

443
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,080
Microsoft right the releases to

444
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,240
production for for major software

445
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,720
products from Microsoft um as of about

446
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,600
2018 they were doing

447
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,240
86,000 deployments a

448
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,159
day right that that's a huge difference

449
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,320
and it takes time and effort to get

450
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,159
there you have to pay back your

451
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,600
technical debt you have to build

452
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
architectures in your product that

453
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
support it you have to build teams and

454
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,159
Knowledge and Skills that support it

455
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,640
but once you get there and you're on

456
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,679
that continuous cycle you can fix stuff

457
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,200
much more quickly you can any changes

458
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,200
you do make have a lower impact right

459
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,799
because you have that instead of

460
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,880
promoting through environments where

461
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,559
it's easy to miss stuff um they promote

462
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,360
through it's usually called a ring based

463
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,240
deployment structure or controlled

464
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,120
exposure to production where you're

465
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,320
actually in production very quickly but

466
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,400
on a small subset of users and then

467
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,960
continually increase the potential blast

468
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,640
rate radius um and you're hoping right

469
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,840
if if each of those rings has enough

470
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,760
people in it um and you're monitoring

471
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,320
the Telemetry and understanding what's

472
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,919
going on within that space you should

473
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,360
minimize the chance of things making it

474
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,960
into production perhaps that's something

475
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,520
that crowd Strike should have done I

476
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,120
just saw a post uh from those guys that

477
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,640
said yeah we're going to start doing

478
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,720
that now it's like yeah you should have

479
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,360
been doing that already you really

480
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,559
should have been doing that already um

481
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,720
so that that move that time to mark

482
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,840
Market getting things quickly uh lead

483
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,000
time cycle time uh um how quickly you

484
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,799
get things in front of customers uh time

485
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,559
to change direction right if you're

486
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,679
doing something and you find out it's

487
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,559
the wrong thing how quickly can you

488
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,480
change direction um time time to build

489
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,919
time to self test uh how quickly can

490
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,440
your developers test things locally I

491
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:58,640
think the Azure devops team was like six

492
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,320
weeks to get a build out the door um

493
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,080
back in 2010 six or eight weeks to get a

494
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,000
build out the door um and now they're

495
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,440
doing continuous delivery so they're

496
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,240
delivering it out the door every day and

497
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,039
and that time to Market reduction even

498
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,039
just time to self test how quickly do

499
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,559
your

500
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,960
developers

501
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,039
know that um they've caused a

502
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,320
failure right how quickly can they find

503
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,159
out they've caused a failure got perfect

504
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,960
example um for for something I've been

505
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,120
doing recently um I build maintain and

506
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,799
support a tool called the Azure devops

507
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:40,000
migration tools um it's for moving data

508
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,120
around in in in Azure devops so you can

509
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,480
copy bulk copy work items with their

510
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,679
history from one server to another

511
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,360
server one environment that thing um but

512
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,200
I decided to update um the the automated

513
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,919
build systems so I have a fully

514
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,559
automated fully integrated end to end

515
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,000
pipeline for continuous delivery to

516
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,320
production with that so I make a change

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,840
I send it to the repo uh I merge it into

518
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,520
Main and it ships to production right uh

519
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,760
uh and I had it in an old tool and I

520
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,400
want to move it to a new tool which

521
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,000
means I had to rebuild the whole thing

522
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,799
in a new new environment and it takes

523
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,720
about 12 minutes to do run the full

524
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,880
process so whenever I make a change I a

525
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,600
convoluted process to get it into a

526
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,679
place where it will run

527
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,360
everything and then running the whole

528
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
build takes 12 minutes so I have to wait

529
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,760
for 12 minutes to find out if the

530
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:47,360
changes that I've made have a result and

531
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,799
it took me probably two weeks to do

532
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,600
something that I should have been able

533
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,960
to do in a couple of days whereas when

534
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,919
I'm making change to the

535
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,080
codes of the product that it was

536
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:03,080
shipping I just make a change run all

537
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,720
the unit tests and within a few seconds

538
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,799
I know whether the change I made was

539
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,440
successful or not and now I can make

540
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,600
another change and a few seconds later

541
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,760
another change another change so

542
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,840
heightening that cycle shortening that

543
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,600
ability for your developers to find out

544
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,400
they've done something wrong I think the

545
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,200
your devops team at one point was 48

546
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,880
hours right uh with their automated

547
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,120
builds and and because they had mostly

548
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,399
end to end system tests don't do that

549
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,520
either anymore right that's like so 15

550
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:36,039
years ago end to end system in fact so

551
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,640
20 years ago end to end system tests are

552
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,120
are not a way to validate that your

553
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,240
product works that's the pands I can't

554
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,080
be bothered actually building quality

555
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,840
into my product and I need to test

556
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,360
quality in way of building of of of of

557
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,000
ensuring that your product works unit

558
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,399
tests unit tests Behavior driven

559
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,880
whatever you need to do but unit tests

560
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,760
fast running super quick unit test I

561
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,720
think the Azure devop team went from 48

562
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,799
hours and then it took them four years

563
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,919
to take all of those I think they had

564
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:12,200
like 30,000 system tests and turn them

565
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,679
into 990,000 unit tests um and the

566
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,679
90,000 unit tests run in 3 and a half

567
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:21,919
minutes and the 30,000 system tests took

568
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,440
two three days to run right that's

569
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,159
that's a huge impact on your engineering

570
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,559
team's ability that Engineers are

571
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,480
waiting for those things to be

572
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,399
successful if they're not waiting

573
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,320
they've moved on to other things and now

574
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:35,399
you're suffering contact switching and

575
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,799
cognitive load between those things so

576
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,799
from a from a organizational capability

577
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:43,799
perspective all of this stuff is 100%

578
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:48,720
within the control of it of engineering

579
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:51,480
of whoever builds the product do that

580
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,320
right if you're able to do that really

581
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,039
quickly and really

582
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:00,000
effectively that gives the business the

583
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,520
incentive that that well we can ask for

584
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,080
something and get a change really quick

585
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,320
so what should we be asking for perhaps

586
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,520
we should start thinking about

587
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,320
hypothesis and trying stuff and testing

588
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,320
stuff that we can get into the product

589
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,799
testing production and then perhaps we

590
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,399
ditch it out the product because it's

591
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,440
not providing the value that we think it

592
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,360
should um

593
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,640
so this idea of evidence-based

594
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:27,039
management as the the the four key value

595
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,960
areas uh so current value which is your

596
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,760
product that exists right now collecting

597
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,919
Telemetry understanding what's going on

598
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,279
and how users are using it your

599
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,320
unrealized value which is things your

600
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,399
product doesn't do yet so it could be

601
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,840
stuff you know it doesn't do yet or that

602
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:46,080
you don't know that it doesn't do yet or

603
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,279
you don't know you don't know that it

604
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,159
doesn't do yet right that's getting new

605
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,919
markets opening up new markets getting

606
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,000
new customers getting new capabilities

607
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,480
right that's your market value and then

608
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,760
at the bottom you've got your

609
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,679
organization capability with ability to

610
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,720
innovate how much time do you spend

611
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,360
adding that new functionality versus

612
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,360
supporting a maintaining existing

613
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,399
functionality and time to Market how

614
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,480
quickly does it take for a change you

615
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:19,279
make to get into production and

616
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,039
hopefully close that learning Loop all

617
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,640
the way back to your products and have

618
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,200
that full time to

619
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:30,399
learn cycle in there that is the four

620
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,320
key value in ideas of evidence-based

621
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,320
management
