As a Product Owner, one of the most crucial yet often overlooked aspects of your role is marketing. Yes, you read that right. Youâ€™re not just managing a product backlog or guiding a development teamâ€”youâ€™re marketing a vision. Whether you're a new Product Owner or seasoned in the role, this skill is vital for success. You need to effectively communicate that vision to various audiences: the team building the product, the stakeholders consuming it, and the customers paying for it. Each group may have different priorities, but they all need to be aligned and engaged with your story.

In this blog post, weâ€™ll dive into how you can become an effective "Product Marketer" and how mastering this can lead to more successful Sprint Reviews, better feedback loops, and ultimately, a product that resonates with your stakeholders and customers.

## **Why Marketing Matters in Product Ownership**

**Marketing in product ownership isnâ€™t about selling a productâ€”it's about selling a story.** You need to craft a narrative that resonates emotionally with everyone involved. Whether it's your team, your stakeholders, or your end customers, they need to buy into what youâ€™re doing and _why_ youâ€™re doing it. This emotional connection keeps them engaged and invested in the productâ€™s success.

### **Building Emotional Engagement**

Engagement isnâ€™t just about participationâ€”it's about **emotional buy-in**. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Team Engagement:** Your team needs to be inspired by the product vision. If theyâ€™re emotionally invested, theyâ€™ll be more motivated to deliver high-quality work.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:** If your stakeholders are emotionally connected to your productâ€™s story, theyâ€™ll be more likely to show up at Sprint Reviews and provide meaningful feedback.

- **Customer Engagement:** Ultimately, customers must feel that your product addresses their needs and speaks to their emotions.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** The key to emotional engagement is consistency in your messaging. Make sure every interaction, presentation, or Sprint Review reinforces the same vision.

## **The Sprint Review Dilemma: Why Stakeholders Donâ€™t Show Up**

One of the biggest challenges Product Owners face is getting stakeholders to attend Sprint Reviews. And even when they do show up, thereâ€™s often a lack of meaningful feedback. You may be familiar with the scenarioâ€”**tumbleweeds** roll through the room as you ask for input. Itâ€™s frustrating and can leave you feeling like youâ€™re not getting the guidance you need to improve the product.

### **Why Is This Happening?**

- **Lack of Emotional Engagement:** If stakeholders donâ€™t feel connected to the productâ€™s vision, they wonâ€™t be eager to provide feedback.

- **Poor Marketing of the Reviewâ€™s Value:** Stakeholders donâ€™t see the value in attending the review because theyâ€™re not emotionally invested in whatâ€™s being shown.

ðŸ”‘ **Key Insight:** Sprint Reviews arenâ€™t just product demonstrations; theyâ€™re a continuation of your marketing efforts. The way you "sell" the review can determine whether stakeholders are engaged and eager to contribute.

### **How to Solve the Problem**

Here are some strategies to boost stakeholder engagement during Sprint Reviews:

- **Sell the Vision Early:** Donâ€™t wait until the Sprint Review to communicate your productâ€™s vision. Make sure stakeholders are aligned with the vision from day one.

- **Make It Interactive:** Turn your Sprint Review into a conversation, not a presentation. Encourage stakeholders to participate by asking for their insights early and often.

- **Show, Donâ€™t Tell:** Instead of simply presenting finished features, let stakeholders experience them. **Invite them to use the product during the review** to foster more engagement.

ðŸŽ¯ **Personal Experience:** In one of my projects, I realized that stakeholders werenâ€™t attending reviews because they didnâ€™t feel connected to the product. We started making small changes by sending out personalized previews of what weâ€™d cover in the reviews, focusing on how it aligned with their goals. Stakeholder attendance and engagement shot up by 60%!

## **How Marketing Aligns Teams and Stakeholders**

When done effectively, **marketing as a Product Owner** doesnâ€™t just sell the product to customers; it aligns everyone involved in its creation. From your development team to the C-suite, everyone needs to understand and support your vision. Without that alignment, there will be friction, delays, and missed opportunities.

### **Key Areas Where Marketing Aligns Teams**

1. **Vision and Strategy Alignment:** Are your team and stakeholders on the same page regarding the productâ€™s purpose and goals?

3. **Feedback Loops:** If stakeholders arenâ€™t providing feedback, you canâ€™t improve the product effectively. Good marketing creates anticipation and excitement, leading to richer feedback.

5. **Value Delivery:** Marketing helps everyone involved see the value being delivered at each stage of development, ensuring that theyâ€™re all heading in the same direction.

## **The Product Backlog Funnel: Streamlining Inputs for Maximum Value**

Another marketing task for the Product Owner is managing the **input funnel** that feeds into the product backlog. Each suggestion, idea, or request needs to be aligned with the productâ€™s overall vision. If youâ€™re not careful, this funnel can become clogged with competing priorities and unaligned features, causing friction within your team and among stakeholders.

### **How to Manage the Funnel**

- **Ensure Consistent Messaging:** Every input should align with the productâ€™s overall vision and goals.

- **Prioritize Based on Value:** Regularly assess which items in the backlog deliver the most value, and market that value to your stakeholders to keep everyone aligned.

## **Advanced Product Ownership: The Visionary and Collaborator**

As you gain more experience as a Product Owner, your role evolves. Youâ€™re no longer just managing the day-to-day backlog, but becoming a **visionary and collaborator**. This is where marketing becomes even more critical.

### **The Visionary: Selling the Future**

As a visionary, your job is to paint a compelling picture of the future for everyone involved in the productâ€™s journey. Youâ€™re not just solving problems for today but **marketing a future state** that excites your team, stakeholders, and customers.

### **The Collaborator: Aligning Inputs**

As a collaborator, youâ€™re responsible for making sure that all the various inputsâ€”whether from customers, team members, or stakeholdersâ€”are funneled into a cohesive strategy. This requires strong marketing skills, especially when you need to explain _why_ some ideas are prioritized over others.
