1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,240
one of the things that a new product

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,960
owner needs to understand is that

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,280
there's a lot of their job which is

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,639
about

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,679
marketing you're going to be marketing

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,199
the the vision that you have in your

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,640
product to the people doing the work to

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,840
the people consuming the work and to the

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,880
people paying for the work might be

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,279
different people they have to buy into

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,160
your story they have to engage with what

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
it is you're trying to to do and

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,480
ultimately they need to engage

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,920
emotionally with that story that's what

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,520
marketing is all about is how do you

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,640
enable people to engage emotionally with

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:50,000
what it is you're trying to do so that

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,160
they're following with anticipation what

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
it is that you're trying to do that's

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,760
how you get people engaged in your story

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,800
one of the the key issues I see in

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,840
organizations is the Great difficulty

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,720
that product owners especially new

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
product owners find in getting your

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,759
stakeholders to turn up for your Sprint

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,080
reviews right and often times it's hard

27
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,799
even if they do turn up to get them to

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,040
provide you with feedback right you ask

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,479
them for feedback and all you can hear

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,280
is tumble weeds rolling through the

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,159
desert right you're trying to engage

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,759
them and they're just not getting there

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,000
and that's to me a marketing issue they

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,720
don't understand the value of what

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,439
you're showing them they're not

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,840
emotionally engaged in what you're

37
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,240
showing them if they were emotionally

38
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,880
engaged they'd be desperate to sneak

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,040
into that Co that discussion and provide

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,799
that feedback provide you with more

41
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,000
information and that is part of

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,240
marketing you need to figure that out

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
how do you get into that story we talk

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,320
about it in the professional scrum

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,759
product owner only a little bit I talk

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,719
about it more than the course whereare

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,439
does so um I like I I like this topic um

48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,879
but also we talk about it a little bit

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,840
more in depth in the advanced product

50
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,280
owner because we start talking about the

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,720
Visionary and the collaborator and the

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,480
different aspects of the product owner

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
and that's where it starts to matter a

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,560
little bit more when you get a little

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,040
bit more advanced but marketing is that

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,200
piece that enables you to sell your

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,760
story and your conversation to the other

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,959
people that are involved in your product

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,000
and maximize the value that you're

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,080
delivering because all the people

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,760
funneling providing input to your funnel

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
that results in your product backlog

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,680
that results in the value that you're

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,200
delivering as you release to customers

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,360
everybody's following the same funnel

66
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,640
rather than buffing buffing against it

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,239
um with friction because they're all

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,120
going in different directions is your

69
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,720
leadership of your organization are your

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,120
members of your team are your customers

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,400
all aligned in where you're going and

72
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,200
what you're trying to

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,040
achieve that's your job as a product

74
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:20,720
owner to figure that out if you find it

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,040
hard to enable this engagement with your

76
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,159
