2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
i'm jb brown the nordstrom innovation

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,960
lab manager and this is the lab

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,559
we work on one week experiments somebody

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,480
will have an idea and we'll find a way

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,320
to figure out how to prove if the idea

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,000
is going to work and this week the

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,400
innovation lab is going to be building

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,080
an ipad app with customer feedback as we

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
go through the week we wanted to work in

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,359
the store to make sure that we were

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,720
getting customer feedback as we worked

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,080
so that we were never working on

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
anything that wasn't valued by the

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
customer and only doing things that are

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,559
delivering value so we'll be building a

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,280
feature and testing it until we get to

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,520
the point where we have something that's

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,320
good enough that we can just leave and

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,559
leave the ipad app behind and have this

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,239
new thing that customers can use

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,399
this is the world's first flash build

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
it's a flash mob where a software team

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
shows up it builds an application in a

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
surprise location this is the nordstrom

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,840
innovation lab and we're at the flagship

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
store in downtown seattle right now the

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
team is just setting up their equipment

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
to get started we're going to build an

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
ipad app that helps customers pick the

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
best pair of sunglasses for them we

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
really don't know what the features are

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
yet we're going to use customer feedback

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,840
as we go along throughout the day and

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,520
the rest of the week in order to build

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,759
the best thing so the next thing we're

37
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,320
going to do is a user story map so we're

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,920
going to sit here and together outline

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
all the steps the customer would take

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
and actually even beforehand how they

41
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,479
buy sunglasses like what are the

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
different things that they might do and

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
how that process might change if we have

44
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
this application and we'll actually dig

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,360
into what we have to build in order to

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,960
support that process so now that we've

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,880
done a card mapping we're going to do a

48
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
paper prototype and this is something

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,159
that we commonly do in the innovation

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
lab it's a great way to

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,880
show what we'd like to do in a rough

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,520
prototype that we can easily throw out

53
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,439
change alter based on feedback from the

54
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
customers i'll continue building

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,399
individual paper slides and our user

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
experience specialist patel will bring

57
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
the prototype to a customer and say okay

58
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
i have this app and this is a paper

59
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,240
version i'd like you to kind of use it

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
like you would normally use an app and

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,079
you can press things interact with them

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
and then she'll change out the pages

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
based on how the customer uses it so

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
it's a similar experience to the ipad

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
only

66
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,800
an analog version

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,720
so it's day two and we have our first

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,879
working prototype of this app and how it

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
works is i take my first pair of

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,280
sunglasses put it on

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,200
take a picture all right and then i want

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,520
to compare it to this other pair i've

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,160
got right here

74
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,160
get these on

75
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,640
take another picture i can just hold

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,519
these up like this and see which one i

77
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,120
like better well telling kim having

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
talking to people and doing paper

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
prototypes we've been coding building an

80
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,000
ipad we take a stab at something we look

81
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
at the paper prototypes they can't put

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,959
together

83
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,480
we might take one at a time usually we

84
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
come to the board and

85
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,560
we grab the most important feature and

86
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,239
we started implementing it the really

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,319
cool thing with this flash build is that

88
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,760
we have actual real customers just today

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,640
we delivered four or five different

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
separate features and i deliver it swap

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
the ipad with tell she'd go and talk to

92
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,920
a customer and 10 minutes later i had

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,360
feedback from real customers about this

94
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,280
thing that i delivered and it changed

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,200
how we did the next thing and it's been

96
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,640
really really great watching day to day

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
what they've been doing the team to get

98
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
all the feedback from the sales people

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
the feedback the sales people gather

100
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
from the customers and it's a really

101
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
interesting process to kind of come in

102
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
on tuesday we had no idea what this

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
would look like there's an idea that

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
somebody had to say people take a lot of

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,400
pictures themselves with the sunglasses

106
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
it'd be cool if we could show them side

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,440
by side to help them make the process

108
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
better and that was the idea that was it

109
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,799
they came in they had nothing built and

110
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
they've been building this literally on

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
the spot throughout each day and by now

112
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
we actually have an app a functioning

113
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,239
app that they can go through it's very

114
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,200
intuitive to help look at themselves and

115
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,040
make the

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
sunglass selection process easier which

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
is pretty cool to watch so yesterday the

118
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
sunglass buyer for nordstrom came down

119
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,080
to check out our progress and she

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
happened to put on polarized glasses and

121
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
then held up the ipad in portrait view

122
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
and was surprised that she couldn't see

123
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
anything because it was black we figured

124
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,840
out the polarization of the ipad running

125
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,920
up and down and the polarization of the

126
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,680
glasses running vertical cancel each

127
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
other out you don't see anything but if

128
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
you turn the ipad to landscape you see

129
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,439
perfectly fine because the polarization

130
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
of the two items line up and it's okay

131
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
so it was pretty good find to be in the

132
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,199
store and she just happened to put on

133
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,400
polarized glasses and so today first

134
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
thing we're going to do is switch it to

135
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,800
a landscape design and then lock in the

136
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
aspect ratio of the ipad so customers

137
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
and sales people just naturally pick it

138
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,240
up and use it in landscape and not try

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
and go to portrait okay so i'm going to

140
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,199
show you what we've been working on the

141
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
last five days we've added quite a few

142
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,720
features over the week you take a

143
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,960
picture multiple pictures of the

144
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,520
customer and then you can pull them up

145
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,600
and tap the first one you can see it

146
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
larger and then tap the second and do a

147
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
side-by-side comparison of each glass

148
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
next to each other we also added a

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
feature where you can rename the picture

150
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
because we heard from sales people if a

151
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
customer is trying on quite a lot of

152
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
glasses it's helpful to be able to know

153
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,000
what order they were taken in and also

154
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,759
rename if you want with the brand or

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
some distinguishing feature about the

156
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
glass another feature we added was the

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
ability to zoom you can zoom in and

158
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,360
really get a good detailed look at the

159
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,240
frames side by side also to see one of

160
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
the pictures larger if you want to just

161
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,919
better view of one frame

162
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
you can flip the camera view as well

163
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
face it forward so the sales person

164
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
could take a picture of it like this or

165
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
you can flip the camera

166
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,639
like so

167
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,479
take a picture

168
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
uh yourself facing forward and then at

169
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
the end of it all we have a button

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
called new customer which just erases

171
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
all of the images and allows the

172
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,680
salesperson to start with a new customer

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,199
we're just trying to put the final

174
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
touches on the app tell talk to a lot of

175
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,080
users and they said that when we went

176
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
into the compare view it was unclear

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,199
where the pictures were coming from and

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
which picture was which so the animation

179
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,080
here is trying to solve that problem

180
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
make it a little more clear what's going

181
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,080
on one of the challenges with software

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
is when are you done right and i think

183
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,800
the answer is really it depends on how

184
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
much time you have

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
at least the most important things got

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
done so this was time box to a week and

187
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
we did a week's worth of work and it

188
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,600
seems like what we have now is something

189
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,440
that makes customers happy and addresses

190
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,000
the main problems and something that we

191
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
can track we have metrics on so

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,880
i think we're going to call that a day

193
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,319
the application has developed so far

194
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
everything's finished everything that

195
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,520
we've asked for and even the little

196
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
roadblocks and glitches that we kind of

197
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,759
stumbled across as we use the app during

198
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
the week has been solved i think that

199
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,440
it's going to be really easy to be able

200
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
to implement into our sale and i think

201
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
that we're going to find a lot of

202
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,280
success with application whether it's

203
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,080
via a selling tool for us or if it goes

204
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,520
public into a downloadable format

205
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,160
whatever happens i think this was

206
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,160
generally quite a success
