screen Yeah, it didn't, didn't, didn't work. I'm going to admit all there. We go. Bony, how are you doing? Morning. I see a few names I recognise. Let me see if I can change the settings on this. Because for some reason, no, it won't let me change the settings. Awesome. Uh, well, keep an eye on that lobby thing you want. It wasn't supposed to have a lobby, but I can't load the settings, so there we go. 

Um, hey Richard, um, Arun, Phil, there are folks I recognise, so welcome to this event. It is being recorded. H I think this matus, uh, it has been recorded. So hopefully, uh, we'll have a nice, a nice fresh copy at the end. We'll see how well it works. This is our first time using this Microsoft webinar malarkey, um, so we'll see how well it goes. 

Um, we are going to be talking today about product ownership and lean product management, and I am probably expecting that you're going to have lots of questions that Joanna and I can field. Um, but I have a small presentation that I want to provide for you. I put together some content to, like, trigger, I guess, trigger some of those questions. Um, I'm aiming for 18 minutes of actually talking at you, uh, so that you get a chance to answer as many, uh, or have as many of your questions asked as possible. 

Um, if you want to queue up your questions for the end, there should be a Q&A button on the screen somewhere, um, and that will allow you to ask, like, have a question and answer rather than it just being a straight chat. I'm not sure if the chat, uh, even, well, it says the chat should be working, but, uh, we'll see. But the questions bit is probably easier to see which questions have been answered and which, uh, questions haven't. 

Um, I am going to share my screen, and I have a lovely mural for what I want to talk about today, but I'll use it in presentation mode. Oh, actually, let me do it the other way around. Then I'm looking at you. You don't want me looking off to the side. If I switch the screen, I use my primary screen. There we go. Now I'll be looking at you when I'm talking. That's a little bit better. 

Uh, so let me switch into, yes, but not that one. I'm going to start there. Let's start at the beginning. That would probably be a good idea. There we go. 

Uh, so, uh, the main topic of today is kind of two things that are really one thing, is the way I think about it. Um, so product ownership and lean product development are two different tracks of, uh, like, um, entomology, where it came from, but really they're talking about or trying to solve very similar problems. And if we bring the ideas from both spaces together, we can, um, hopefully have an even better outcome. 

Uh, because I found some interesting information, uh, that nine out of ten product releases are failures, i.e., they're not a success. And I know you may have a product, uh, that is a lot more successful than that. That is absolutely, uh, possible. But I'm sure you've been part of and seen, um, a lot of product releases that are, uh, not complete successes, right? There's quite often, well, some things work, but then other things not so much. 

And this just ties into that idea that, in actual fact, 70% of all startups fail in the first year, right? We have ideas, we try and implement them in our products, right, or build a whole company around that idea, and it's unsuccessful. Um, and in fact, even products that companies that survived the first year, 50% of what that 30% that survived the first year fail in the first five years. 

So we have a pretty high failure rate for whole companies, let alone individual products, individual ideas. And did even the product that you created actually provide the value for, uh, for the organisation or for the users that was expected, uh, from the investment that you made, right? So it's a big deal. 

So why did they fail to meet, um, their objectives? Um, and there's really a, I feel like a very simple answer for that, and that's because the product management role is not well understood in organisations. It's not, um, well implemented in organisations, and quite often, organisational, um, traditional organisational rules impede the ability for that person to be able to make the decisions that need to be made to maximise the value of what it is that we're trying to do. 

Um, but also, not just the organisational impediments, but lots of people are given this role to manage a product or be a product owner, and they really have no idea what that is, what it entails, or what they need to be able to do in order to fulfil it. Um, it's quite, I feel, a massive issue because of that, of the scale of the amount of money that's being, um, invested in products and how much waste there is, uh, in those ideas. 

So I see it a lot in almost every engagement with almost every customer, um, that I work with. It's very difficult to find somebody who both understands what the product owner is supposed to be and is able to actually fulfil it within their organisation. Um, quite often, people do understand those that do understand what they should be doing aren't actually able to do it because of the way the organisation is structured or the way the organisation is doing things. 

Um, and I have a quite interesting, uh, blog post. I did a post, somebody asked me, I was working at a customer, and they asked me, um, like, what is a product owner? What are they supposed to be able to do? And I wrote a blog post that really sounded like a CV, like a job advert for a product owner, right? So I created a how do you hire a product professional product owner blog post, um, and I spread it around a lot of the scrum.org trainers, um, and other people that I recognise as having expertise there. 

And one of the quotes that came back was from Frederick that made it straight into the post. Um, and I think this is a key, uh, thing for organisations to realise. Um, and you could put product owner or product manager in this space. I'm going to talk about why. Um, but I love this quote: the product owner is a key position that sets the tone for product leadership and the definition of success in the organisation. If you don't have clear and concise product ownership, you're not going to have success for a product. 

You need to be working towards a cohesive vision. Um, you might, I know I work with lots of products where the product is big enough already, or, um, the organisation finds it difficult to innovate, so they innovate by buying any competitors that come up with good ideas, right, and absorbing it into their own product. Um, but really those products themselves are not innovating. It's too hard to innovate in the product. 

Um, so it's very difficult to be overall successful, and that comes to that, uh, comment that I made about, like, product management and product owner. What, like, does these two things? What are they? There was never any intent, uh, from scrum.org, oh, not from scrum, from the scrum guide for the product owner to be, um, a job title, right? It was never intended to be an actual job title. It's an accountability that somebody picks up, and it's probably part of the overall accountabilities of the organisation, of the overall accountabilities, um, that that person has been given by the organisation for their role, right? 

So what I would expect to see in organisations is that you have a job role, and then you're given a bunch of little individual accountabilities, and the product owner is one of those accountabilities. And generally, it's part of product management. So I would expect somebody who is a product owner, um, who's fulfilling that accountability within the context of scrum, they would be a product manager, and thus they would be responsible and accountable for many more things within the body of product management. 

And that's kind of expected within the context of scrum. This is not something that, um, is, if you, you as an individual, right, the product owner is picking up the accountability of maximising the value return from the work done by the team. All the things that are in product management need to happen in order for that to be successful, right? So, um, that's why that's such an important, um, thing, like, distinction to make. 

When scrum was created, the product owner, um, was an unknown term, right? The creators of scrum picked terms that didn't have any baggage, uh, product owner and scrum master, right? Um, but over the last 25, 30 years, uh, they've picked up tons and tons of baggage. Um, so our understanding of what those things are is often different from what it actually is because our organisation has put additional things into that story. 

So just be careful of that because, uh, scrum is a very specific accountability from product owner. So disambiguate my job title as product owner from the scrum accountability as product owner. They might be very different things, uh, within my organisational construct because you'll go to another organisation and it'll be different again, right? And that's that difference. 

Um, so this is from the PSPO class, just highlighting the breadth of what it is we need to know. It kind of expands over, as you go further down in this pyramid. Um, so empiricism is obviously founding the thing that scrum is based on, is trying to be an empirical process, right? So that we have all those feedback loops, and all scrum, the scrum guide talks about is that context. How do I, what's the minimum I need in order to maintain an empirical process, right? That's scrum's, uh, focus. 

But that's not the only thing we need, right? As a product owner, um, in as a product manager, we're going to have to add a whole bunch of other tools and practices to our story. Um, some of those tools just come from product management, right? So, uh, things like A/B testing and market research and business modelling and product visions are all things that have been around for a lot longer than agile has. Um, they've been around for many years, uh, but quite often we want to look at some of those things with an agile lens on to say how do we, instead of doing this all up front, how do we integrate it into our process, uh, and bring it all together? 

And that will lead into, um, the other part that I want to talk about as well, um, the leaning product management. So I'm sure you're all familiar with this, uh, scope, time, budget. Um, this is, if we measure, um, our success, uh, by on time, on scope, on budget, um, can all of those be true and we're still unsuccessful at delivering value to our customer? And of course it is, right? We can deliver exactly what the customer asked for and exactly the time they asked for it to be done on budget, right, for the exactly the amount of money, and the business has changed since they made the request. 

Therefore, what we've created doesn't fulfil the need. Um, and that happens a lot more than we would like. Uh, we kind of had blinkers on, uh, when we're thinking about that, you know, oh yeah, we were successful, we delivered that product, and it's like, yes, but did it provide the value to the customer? And that value, um, is the key, should be the key focus of the product owner. It should be the key focus of product management, right, regardless of what it is you're building. 

And on time, on scope, on budget is largely irrelevant measures to denote success in that story. Um, there are other things that we probably want to do, um, but what often happens, um, and again, this is, we talk about this in the PSO class, uh, but this idea of, um, in a traditional, and I use that word really loosely, but traditional project management practices, right, we have project charters, we have plans, we have times, we have budgets, we have scopes, we have milestones, right? 

These are all part of that story. It's how our traditional project management practices, um, mitigate and visualise risk, right? That's how we figure out what it is we need to do when we need to do it. All of those things. And when we start, organisations start transitioning towards a more scrum or agile mindset, um, they realise that they're supposed to remove those things. So they take those pillars away that are supporting the ability to deliver high-quality, low-risk products or lower-risk risk, right? Lower mitigate the risk. 

Um, they remove those pillars, and then they forget to replace it with anything. Uh, so the one of the core focuses, um, that I like to see organisations work on is what are you refilling those pillars with? If you're not going to have time and budget and scope and milestones, right, if you're not going to have those things, what are you going to do instead? How are you going to create that iterative, um, reflective process so that you can, um, build products rather than just fall on your ass, which is what happens when you take all the pillars away and there's nothing supporting, uh, what it is that you're trying to do? 

Which is, and the thing that we'd like people to focus on is this idea of vision, value, and validation. Do you actually understand where you're going, and can you communicate it? Do you understand what value it is, um, that you want to create, right? Not time, budget, and scope, but what is the value? What is the problem you're trying to solve? What is that worth to the organisation? Are you actually making progress towards it? 

Um, and that comes through the validation. Did we actually provide the value that we thought we were going to create, and do we need to work differently on it? Bringing in those iterative, incremental cycles. And I find most traditional organisations find this very difficult to get their head around, this difference between, um, the mechanism that we use in used before and the mechanisms that we're trying to use now. 

Um, so bringing in some of those ideas of lean product development, um, this is a typical diagram. If you search for lean product development online, like a graphic for lean product development, this is the image you're going to get: build, measure, learn, right? Um, we need to actually create something in order to see whether it added value. We're going to measure what's going on, and then we're going to analyse the data to figure out, you know, what do we need to do differently in order to close that value loop and actually deliver more valuable stuff to the customer. 

But this is very familiar, right? There's lots of implementations out there of this exact same story. Um, in the scrum world, we talk about inspection and adaption and transparency, right? We need transparency to see what's going on, right? What is it that we're actually doing? And then we need to look at it, right? There's no point in having all this data that shows you what's going on, um, and not actually looking at it. And then if you're going to look at it, you want to change the way you do things in order to maximise the value. 

And all of these loops are implementing is from different stories around the same thing. All of these things are trying to implement exactly the same thing. So as long as we're focusing on this idea of we need to actually build something to figure it out, and then we need to measure it, like if you're missing the measures, you're building in the dark, right? You're building stuff and shipping it, and maybe it adds value, maybe it doesn't, maybe it solves the customer's problem, maybe it doesn't. 

Uh, so that is a core need to that story. So we've got this idea of product ownership, which comes from scrum, right? Although it's been adapted and adopted into that terminology has been adopted into lots of different practices over the years. And then we've got this idea of lean, right? Um, the lean movement came out of Toyota, is really the foundation of what scrum and agile is. It was based on originally, it was an adaptation of those techniques from lean manufacturing into the world of much more complex things that we're creating. 

Um, so they all have a similar entomology. Um, and if we bring those things together, I think I've got a missing, so I'll just go fix it. If we bring those things together, um, we really have this fun, all of this information, all those ideas, it has to go through this funnel, and we hopefully end up squeezing out some value at the end. 

Uh, but what is that thing in the middle that has to happen? Um, and this is something that is implied in the scrum guide because we're maximising the value, right? So this is implied. You can't maximise value without this, but it's not explicit because there are perhaps other ways to maximise the value other than just this activity. But it's key. I think many of you here will be software focused, right? So it's kind of key to our activity. 

Um, and that is to actually release. You need to actually release your product to real users, not pretend users, not UAT. Um, the only way to realise value is to actually get your product in front of real users. And that as well is really hard for organisations, right? Because they want, since we've traditionally, um, as an industry, building software, we've traditionally sucked at delivering high-quality product. 

So, um, yeah, why would they trust us to deliver them high-quality product if we've continuously and repeatedly proven that we can't deliver high-quality products that's of use to them, right? So they put a whole bunch of checks and balances in the way in order to prevent us wasting their money, um, and perhaps breaking production. So things like UAT, change requests, um, uh, Maril Lynch, I used to have to fill out a release form, right? You're going to define your intent to release, and it had to be six weeks before you were going to do the release. 

Otherwise, it was considered an emergency release, right? Because of the old school thinking around preventing risk, preventing change getting into those production environments because it's going to break something. Um, but in our agile thought process, our lean thought process, we actually want to do continuous small changes, and hopefully the changes are small enough that we don't end up with a big enough fault in production, um, that it causes a massive fiscal problem, right? 

That which is what's happened traditionally. And I really like, um, if you've not read it before, you should read, uh, the "Protecting Agile BS" article, white paper from the US Department of Defense. Um, I believe it's a critical, critical article in our space that really talks about the thing that we don't like to talk about, which is are we lying to ourselves about whether we're agile or not, right? 

Because lots of organisations will tell you they're agile. They'll tell you they do things in an agile way, but when you start asking them questions about whether people can change the process that they work under or whether they can change the backlog or whether they can actually talk to customers or whether they can ship their product to production on a regular basis, um, or whether they even understand what it is they're working on and what they're working towards, and these, all of these things are not true in their organisation, or many of those things are not true, which effectively negates their ability to claim that they're agile, right? 

Um, and I kind of like, I always use this image, which is the kind of litmus test that that article provides. You're either all of these things are true or it's agile BS. Um, it's a pretty harsh litmus test, but not many organisations actually succeed at it. Um, but this is the litmus test that, um, US Department of Defense procurement officers are supposed to use when evaluating a vendor's ability, uh, to engage on a product. 

Um, so they're spending your money, right? That's the thing. If somebody's spending your money, that you almost can't have too harsh a set of checks, uh, to put in there. So I just zoom in a little bit. So these are really, really important, and I think, um, I've, I've, a few of you might have been, um, at, I've done this at conferences where I've got everybody in the room to stand up, uh, or on virtual and put their hand up. 

Um, and I go through each question and ask them to sit down or put their hand down if it's not true, right? Um, for their organisation as a whole, right? It might be true for one product in an organisation, but in the organisation as a whole, is it true? Um, and even I did a DevOps conference in Vilnius, um, 500 people in the room, and at the end of all six of these questions, there was only two people left standing at the end that could say all of those things true. 

Uh, we're half-arsing, half-arsing our implementations, absolutely half-arsing them. Um, and we need to recognise that we are rather than telling the business that we're agile because the business doesn't necessarily understand that we're actually not, but because we're lying to ourselves, we're also lying to them, right? That for me is a big deal. 

Uh, so, uh, this idea of customer-centricity, we need to all be on the same page. We need to be all focusing towards the same thing. That's my idea here. And I have a couple of things that I think are quite important to consider that are often not considered. Um, and one of my favourite pieces is this value pyramid. There's a B2C version and a B2B, right? It depends whether you're Apple on the left or you're, um, I don't know, Microsoft on the right that are selling B2B solutions. 

Um, these value pyramids are about, um, connecting people that are using your product to what it is you're trying to achieve with your product. And that's why, um, Apple was the roaring success that it was, right? Because they convinced everybody, not necessarily everybody, but many people to care about their products. People don't queue up outside of an Apple store to buy for two days camping out to buy a new version of the product because it's just a product I'm going to buy it, right? 

They care about the company, they care about the vision of the company, they care about what the company's trying to achieve. They want to support that company in what it is doing because we believe in the message that you're trying to present. Um, and that's one of the core superpowers of the product owner is getting people to care about what it is you're creating. 

Because I'll tell you this now, that people doing work don't do it very well when they don't care about the outcomes of that work. When they're, they're the, like, if I don't care about the thing that I'm trying to achieve, how much effort am I actually going to put into it? Not as much as I would if I actually cared, as if I'm actually trying, I actually want it to be successful. I'm actually connected to that product. 

But it's also true from the customer side as well, right? Are your customers engaged with your products? Do they care about the value that it's providing them, right? Your product helps me do my job better, therefore I care about your product. Is it actually helping me? Or do I, if I feel like you don't care, then I'm probably not going to care either. 

It's a whole bit that's missing from a lot of product management, a lot of that focus. And you see out there organisations that are doing this really well. Uh, Spotify have done this very well in the past. Um, Microsoft are starting to do this. Uh, they've done it badly in the past. Apple have been doing it well for years, right? There's lots of organisations out there that are definitely examples of not only product management but turning around their previous efforts at product management to make it a better place. 

Um, and one of those things, remember in the do measure learn, we need to measure, right? We need to measure what's happening in our product. We need to measure what we're working towards. We need to really understand, um, the metrics, which they don't make our decisions for us, but they do inform, uh, the decisions that we make. 

Uh, so this is just an example. This is one of the measurement systems out there, evidence-based management, uh, which has these four key value areas that you should try and have at least some measure in each of those key value areas, uh, to try and make sure you're not missing something, right? Uh, current value is your product that exists. Unrealised value is what should be on your backlog. Ability to innovate, um, is how much time do you spend actually making new stuff rather than struggling with complexity? 

And time to market is how quickly you can actually get stuff out there so that goes to, you know, supporting current customers, opening up new markets, um, maintaining our ability to create stuff and getting stuff out to customers as quickly as possible. Um, and that's this whole quality picture as well, which I think is super valuable. So if you're not familiar with evidence-based management, it's definitely worth a look. If you're already familiar with it, you probably already know what you're not doing or what you're missing from your story. 

Um, but it's always a good example and set up. Um, and on kind of to do with the value pyramid, um, the next most important thing to be, uh, focused on to have everybody on the same page for is goals, vision, um, and goals, right? Where is it you're going? What is it you're trying to achieve? Does every single person working on every single part of your product actually understand the work that they're doing today and how it connects to the overall outcomes of the product, right? 

Providing value, and this goes partly to that. If you're focusing on people, um, you know, Dan Pink's Drive, autonomy, mastery, and purpose, this goes directly to purpose, right? Do people see how their work contributes to the overall outcomes? And that, that's really important. That's also on the DoD, um, um, article as well. Your sprint goal and your product goal and your vision are tools to help people make those connections. They're tools for the product owner to engage people and help them, uh, uh, uh, product management as well, um, to gain that understanding. 

So, uh, I'm over how long I wanted to be. Joanna did warn me that I had, uh, too much content, but if you've been to my presentations before, which I know some of you have, you'll know I always have too much stuff. Take too long. But I just have, uh, uh, we're on the home straight. I have some challenges, uh, that I've mentioned. I just want to summarise some and maybe introduce a few more. 

Um, one of the huge challenges in organisations for product owners and product management is influence. Do you, as a product owner or product manager, have the influence that you need in an organisation in order to be successful? Do you have control? I, I've got a little example diagram. Um, I use this one in the product owner class. We do some exercises with it. 

Um, here's one I've filled out, right? Um, and this is where each of those, I feel, each of those things would go for a professional scrum team, right? An organisation that's invested in professional scrum. So you can see they've got the organisation, uh, what they influence, uh, the product owner and the developers. I've probably been a little bit harsh, uh, to the organisation, but, um, in this story, you can see that things like, uh, uh, budget and, uh, um, marketplace and customers and, uh, all the stakeholders and competition are all within the influence of the product owner. 

Although some of it's within the influence of the organisation and some of it's within the influence of the developers, right? So from a product owner's perspective, are you able to influence the budget, right? Because if you believe that a new thing is worth it, um, does the organisation trust you to give you the money to invest in it and see if it is worth it, right? Or do they not? 

Uh, lots of good stories about how this has changed in a lot of organisations. Um, an organisation I work with, which is a massive organisation that has massive hardware costs, and I mean big, big machines, like hundreds of millions of dollars for machines, has just pushed responsibility all the way down to the shop floor for purchasing of any amount of money. 

So somebody on a shop floor who needs to replace a machine because it's worn out, they can approve a $200 million spend to go replace that machine because they understand what the machine is doing and how it works. Some bean counter up in leadership somewhere doesn't understand the ramifications and might deny that request because it's not in their budget for the year. 

Um, so that's really important that people are able to do the things, and that's about influence, right? Can you influence those decisions? And this is like this, the scrum agile story of where does influence sit? Um, and who influences what? Very, very important, I think. 

Uh, the other one that I mentioned before, uh, the three Vs: vision, value, and validation are missing. Like, I can't find them. Where are they in an organisation? Um, because once you've come along and got rid of the yearly budgets, milestones, um, and those older, um, tech techniques for managing risk, what are you replacing with? If you're not replacing with anything, you're just broken. 

Um, and metrics, what are you measuring? And not just what are you measuring at the product level, at the feature level? What do you, what do you mean? What are you measuring holistically in your product, right? Not at the individual feature level. And I find so, so often these measures are just missing. They're just gone. Nobody has a clue how much the product costs to make. They don't have a clue what the revenue is. 

Um, if these things are not intrinsically understood throughout the product structure, how can the people who are making the decisions every day possibly affect the best decision they possibly can if they don't understand the cost, the value, what customers think of the products? You need to understand all of these key indicators. 

And then, uh, scaling is a massive, absolutely massive problem that organisations have, um, because they scale crap. That's what they scale. You know, we've got poorly performing teams who don't understand our product because they don't have any metrics. They don't understand. They don't have goals. They don't have a vision. They're not aligned. And yet we decide to put 20 teams together to build a product, um, and think it's going to be awesome. 

Um, if you scale mediocrity, you get even worse than mediocrity, right? You need to scale awesome. You need amazing teams who are really good at doing what they do because as soon as you put multiple teams working on a product together, you're going to add complexity. You're going to add inhibit their ability to deliver value. So they have to be the best they possibly can be before they even get there. Otherwise, it's just going to be a disaster. 

So that was everything I had for today. So I'm interested in what questions you have. So I'm going to stop sharing, and I'll bring that back over here. There we go. I went a little bit over, Joanna, a little bit, tiny bit, like a very small end. Yeah. Um, Carla had a question there, or it was just the latest one I saw. There's quite a few questions. Let me go back. Uh, no, Carla is the longest ago, so that was 31 minutes ago on my 18-minute talk. 

So, Carla, that was before I even started. No, it wasn't. It wasn't because I took too long. Um, so what is fail in that context? Um, it's not actually providing, I would say it's not actually providing value to the customer or, uh, of limited value, not, uh, not solving their problem is probably the closest I would get. Feel free to come off mute. Everybody can come mute and chime in. 

Um, may I? I have my own definition of failure in general. If you fail to learn, then, Houston, you are in the biggest problems because, in fact, if we look into the data, well, in my opinion, it's not reasonable to fight with data, pretend that the data is telling us the opposite, right? Many companies fail, many ideas fail. The best companies that I know personally, they are masters of learning and treating every single problem, every single bad decision as an opportunity to improve and to make future decisions better. 

So in that case, I would say learning is an important part of agility and looking for a success in the future. I agree. One of my favourite quotes is from Satya Nadella, um, and I'm going to try it off the cuff, but he said he would rather have his best people and his best engineers working on the problems of how to make everybody more effective, that learning piece, um, than working on new features. 

He'd rather have everybody working on their own effectiveness, um, he called it productivity, right? But leadership, our own productivity than, um, than adding actual features because if you maximise your productivity, you can come back and add as many features as you like, and it's easy to add features. 

Uh, so definitely focusing on the right thing is quite important. Oh, Carla's got all the questions. Um, how do you work with an organisation who is fixed on the idea of having a product manager and product owners and, in a way, seeing POs more as backlog admins but not really as a decision? I know, I think I know where you're going with that. Um, it just sucks. 

Uh, they're not really product owners. They're, they're, they're admins. They're product backlog admins, right? Which is not the same thing as product owners. It sounds like the true product owner might be the product manager who then is delegating to a scribe who's writing things down for the, as the product owner. Um, and that we're just not going to get the value we expect. 

I don't know if you've seen, um, there's a graph I'm going to try and describe it, but it's got, um, how much value you're able to create and time. And if you're doing, you're doing traditional, right, we're going to deliver once at the end, then you've got that flat line of we've not delivered any value, and then we deliver all the value at the end. 

Um, and if we get onto that, um, we're asking for a whole bunch of stuff up front, which I think is kind of like what you're talking about. It doesn't seem like that product owner, that that team has the ability to change what it is they're working on, right? Because it's coming from on high. Product managers have decided that these are the 20 things we need to deliver, right? 

So if we're delivering those 20 things, but all we can control, for example, is the order and the breakdown of those things, then we still have to get to the same point as the traditional, but it's probably a slopey line. You're delivering a little bit of value all the time as you go forward, so you can at least engage your stakeholders. You're getting a little bit more, but in order to really maximise that value, you have to be able to change what you're working on because businesses make different decisions every day. 

Does that make sense, Carla? I see. Yes, thank you. I was more looking for, uh, what would be the suggestions to make to the organisation or what kind of proof can you show more, uh, more in that sense that this hierarchy of product manager and the, the slaves you call product owners to work with the scrum teams, it is not working out. 

So what kind of information do you provide them? Because this, the situation is that the product managers do not want to interact with the scrum teams, which would be the best situation. Yeah, I definitely, I definitely feel you there. Um, speed on the traditional decision-making processes in organ. So this is completely not to do with scrum and agile, right? Traditional decision-making has decisions made at the top and done at the bottom, but the people at the bottom that are doing are the people that are actually connected directly to the market. 

So, um, something needs to be painful enough for those people for them to escalate it, and at every level escalate it to somebody who can make the decision. Like your product manager might only be two or three up. Maybe it's only two up, and then they have to instruct their subordinates in a way that they actually understand, and they don't just go, oh yeah, whatever, right? We're busy. 

Um, and it has to be painful enough for them escalated enough. It needs to be a big enough deal for that information to then trickle down and a change to be made. And that takes too long. It takes far too long. It can take weeks or months for those things to happen. And what's the cost of delay of not being able to respond? The market's changed, and our competitors can change faster than we can. What's that cost? 

If you happen to be in a market where none of your competitors are changing faster than you, you're changing faster than your competitors, you're probably doing okay, right? You could always work a little bit faster, but you're doing okay. Companies don't change unless there's a reason to change. It's going to cost money to change, right? Investment. 

So, um, you need to find, is there a competitor that's taking our business away? And focus on that. We need to be faster than them, right? 

Richard, oh, Rickard, sorry, Rickard, I just, yeah, hey Martin, hey Joanna. Yeah, um, I'm also thinking about if you have a product, I mean a product owner who's kind of the scribe of the product manager, there's a risk that you lose transparency in theirs too because you have one person, this a whisper game, right? You have one person telling another some other guy what to do, and he just, yeah, that's what you told me. 

And there might be some miscommunication there, and that will increase the risk of transparency in the whole process, right? Yeah, I totally agree. Totally agree, Rickard. Um, yes, Danna, if I may, uh, well, from a practical point of view, because I believe Carla was also looking for some piece of advice. 

Um, in my experience, you will not sell the idea talking about what we are having right now, like transparency. You need to find a pain point. H, and what I love doing, I'm waiting for an opportunity when, for instance, those product managers making decisions, they feel overwhelmed because when they will be in this pain moment, there might be an opportunity to tell them, hey, what about a small experiment? 

What will happen if you create some more space? You will allow those product owners to make more decisions in a certain area just for the sprint, just in that case. Let's create constraints for that process, and then we will come back. It's just an experiment, right? We are not asking you to now change everything in the company. Check whether it will work because thanks to that, you will gain more time for other stuff. 

Obviously, there's too much on your table, and let's see what will happen for this scrum team. So that might be also an opportunity to create small steps and help product owners get more empowerment in the organisation. You know the fun thing is that this little kingdom of hers came because as a solution to remove the overwhelm from product managers. 

Yeah, yeah, and then now we have a different set of problems. But anyway, but yeah, it's highlighting the pain points is a great, great advice. There are so many, I agree, Carla, that that pushing people into ability-based groups really creates those, it maximises silos, right? Um, yeah, it's hard. It's hard. 

But when you are a silo, it means that you will have your pains. Trust me, if you haven't experienced that, and here comes the opportunity to talk for different ideas. Uh, cool. I'm just reading that other question from Gam. I'm probably mangling your name. I, that was terrible. Probably. Oh, that was, that was good. 

Oh, was that okay? Oh, awesome. I'm glad. H, do you have recommendations on how to phrase frame strategic goals for a product? We often see product goals defined as we will implement X capability or workflow. Um, we go, yeah, we go from product vision straight to feature list. 

Um, it, the, the bit where I think you're going to get traction there is when, because they're going to, they're going to struggle. This is true for, for sprint goals as well. They're going to struggle to say one thing, right? If when you see a sprint goal that's deliver these 10 things or even three things, here's three things that we're going to do this sprint, or you see a product goal that's the same, or the group struggles to create that focus for it's because they're looking too low level, right? 

Like you're saying, they're looking at that feature level and deciding on features, and the features inform the goal because they're working backwards. They're focused on what it is they're delivering, right? And then they're coming up to a, why are we working on this? And that's the wrong way around. You need to think about why are we delivering this? What are we, what, like, what are we trying to achieve? 

And that informs the contents of your backlog, not the other way around. Your backlog doesn't create the goals. Your goals create the backlog. So you can do a test and say, what is it we're trying to achieve as an organisation with this product, right? That's our vision, right? What is it we're trying to achieve? Why are we here? 

Then, and as a simple statement, then come up with what's our first, what's the first step that we could take towards that? That would be your product goal. And then you look at your backlog and say, what have we got in here that works towards this? Oh, nothing? Well, we're not working on the right thing, right? We don't have the right stuff in our backlog. 

So trying, it is a trap. It is absolutely a trap, um, to decide on your goals based on your backlog because that's, that's, you still might be working on the wrong thing. 

And is there a specific format that you would recommend that would force us? I'm thinking we typically use value trees to, you know, express this is my product and this is what I'm going to focus on, right? If I could enforce a format for my business goals, presumably that will force people to think business as opposed to feature, if you see what I mean. 

If your goal doesn't fit this specific format, it's probably not a good goal. Does that make sense? It does, and there are lots of tools out there for creating, writing goals. Um, I'm working with an organisation just now that uses OKRs, um, also SMART goals. I did a blog post recently, um, Gulam, on how to write goals, how to write good goals. 

It might help, also might not answer your question directly, uh, but I think this is something that everybody struggles with. And Joanna and I normally do like a, yeah, fast goals. We normally do a workshop with the leadership team to figure out what those goals are because only they know, right? 

Um, and so it's something that you can do yourself as well with your team is have you ever done, um, we do exercises sometimes like create a product box. That's a great exercise to have people align on what is it we're trying to achieve. If your product was going to sit on a shelf in the supermarket and you had to encourage people to pick it up, what would the box look like and what would it say on it, right? 

That, that's, that's the, what are we trying to achieve? How do we create a vision? And then connect the people with that vision. And creating that box, doing that creative endeavour together of creating that box can be a great way to get everybody aligned on what it is. And if they're sitting there arguing about what features should be on the back of the box, they're not aligned, right? You can see that right away. 

Um, and I know lots of organisations struggle with that because especially I know your organisation quite well, um, that some of the products are pretty big, right? So when it's a really big product, it's difficult to get that vision. And I would point it, I know you guys use Azure DevOps. Um, think of what Azure DevOps did to solve that problem. They broke the product down into Azure boards, Azure repos, um, Azure pipelines, right? 

Here's key value chains that we can understand and compartmentalise a little bit and kind of say this is what we're working towards here, or, you know, we can look at the market for that. We can look at within the bounds of that, which sounds like what you're doing anyway, right? Don't know if that helps. Thanks, it does. 

Thanks. Ah, and then the last question there, the most recent one, um, it's kind of in reverse order, was from again from Carla. I'm probably mangling your name. I, that was terrible. Probably. Oh, that was, that was good. Oh, was that okay? Oh, awesome. I'm glad. H, do you have recommendations on how to phrase frame strategic goals for a product?

They're focused on what it is they're delivering, right? And then they're coming up to a, why are we working on this? And that's the wrong way around. You need to think about why are we delivering this? What are we, what, like, what are we trying to achieve? 

And that informs the contents of your backlog, not the other way around. Your backlog doesn't create the goals. Your goals create the backlog. So you can do a test and say, what is it we're trying to achieve as an organisation with this product, right? That's our vision, right? What is it we're trying to achieve? Why are we here? 

Then, and as a simple statement, then come up with what's our first, what's the first step that we could take towards that? That would be your product goal. And then you look at your backlog and say, what have we got in here that works towards this? Oh, nothing? Well, we're not working on the right thing, right? We don't have the right stuff in our backlog. 

So trying, it is a trap. It is absolutely a trap, um, to decide on your goals based on your backlog because that's, that's, you still might be working on the wrong thing. 

And is there a specific format that you would recommend that would force us? I'm thinking we typically use value trees to, you know, express this is my product and this is what I'm going to focus on, right? If I could enforce a format for my business goals, presumably that will force people to think business as opposed to feature, if you see what I mean. 

If your goal doesn't fit this specific format, it's probably not a good goal. Does that make sense? It does, and there are lots of tools out there for creating, writing goals. Um, I'm working with an organisation just now that uses OKRs, um, also SMART goals. I did a blog post recently, um, Gulam, on how to write goals, how to write good goals. 

It might help, also might not answer your question directly, uh, but I think this is something that everybody struggles with. And Joanna and I normally do like a, yeah, fast goals. We normally do a workshop with the leadership team to figure out what those goals are because only they know, right? 

Um, and so it's something that you can do yourself as well with your team is have you ever done, um, we do exercises sometimes like create a product box. That's a great exercise to have people align on what is it we're trying to achieve. If your product was going to sit on a shelf in the supermarket and you had to encourage people to pick it up, what would the box look like and what would it say on it, right? 

That, that's, that's the, what are we trying to achieve? How do we create a vision? And then connect the people with that vision. And creating that box, doing that creative endeavour together of creating that box can be a great way to get everybody aligned on what it is. And if they're sitting there arguing about what features should be on the back of the box, they're not aligned, right? You can see that right away. 

Um, and I know lots of organisations struggle with that because especially I know your organisation quite well, um, that some of the products are pretty big, right? So when it's a really big product, it's difficult to get that vision. And I would point it, I know you guys use Azure DevOps. Um, think of what Azure DevOps did to solve that problem. They broke the product down into Azure boards, Azure repos, um, Azure pipelines, right? 

Here's key value chains that we can understand and compartmentalise a little bit and kind of say this is what we're working towards here, or, you know, we can look at the market for that. We can look at within the bounds of that, which sounds like what you're doing anyway, right? Don't know if that helps. Thanks, it does. 

Thanks. Ah, and then the last question there, the most recent one, um, it's kind of in reverse order, was from again from Carla. I'm probably mangling your name. I, that was terrible. Probably. Oh, that was, that was good. 

Oh, was that okay? Oh, awesome. I'm glad. H, do you have recommendations on how to phrase frame strategic goals for a product? We often see product goals defined as we will implement X capability or workflow. 

Um, we go, yeah, we go from product vision straight to feature list. 

Um, it, the, the bit where I think you're going to get traction there is when, because they're going to, they're going to struggle. This is true for sprint goals as well. They're going to struggle to say one thing, right? If when you see a sprint goal that's deliver these 10 things or even three things, here's three things that we're going to do this sprint, or you see a product goal that's the same, or the group struggles to create that focus for it's because they're looking too low level, right? 

Like you're saying, they're looking at that feature level and deciding on features, and the features inform the goal because they're working backwards.
