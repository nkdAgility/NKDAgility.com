[Music]

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,559

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,440

31
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,479
talking today uh about product ownership

32
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,840
and lean product management and I am

33
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:54,439
probably expecting that you're going to

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:59,920
have lots of questions that Joanna and I

35
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:02,960
can field um but I have a small uh uh

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,759
presentation that I want to H provide

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,079
for you I put together some content to

38
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:11,160
like trigger I guess trigger some of

39
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:16,360
those questions um it's I'm aiming for

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:19,519
18 minutes of actually talking at you uh

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,599
so that you get a chance to answer as

42
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,480
many uh or have as many of your

43
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,879
questions asked as possible um if you

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,640
want to queue up your questions for the

45
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,440
end there should be a Q&A button

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,959
on the screen somewhere um and that will

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,920
allow you to to to to ask like have a

48
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,519
question and answer rather than it just

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,720
being a straight

50
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,680
chat I'm not sure if the chat uh even

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,800
well it says been the the the chat

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,200
should be working but uh we'll see but

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
the questions bit probably easier to see

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,959
which questions have been answered and

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:03:01,519
which uh questions haven't um I am going

56
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,760
to share my screen and I have a lovely a

57
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,080
lovely mural for what I want to talk

58
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,850
about today but I'll use it in

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,930
presentation

60
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,930
[Music]

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
mode oh actually let me do it the other

62
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,640
way around then I'm looking at you you

63
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,200
don't want me looking off to the side if

64
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,440
I I switch the

65
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,680
screen I use my primary screen there we

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,159
go now I'll be looking at you when I'm

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,400
when I'm talking that's a little bit

68
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:34,599
better uh so let me switch into we yes

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
but not that one I'm going to start

70
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,560
there let's start at the beginning that

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
would probably be a good

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,159
idea there we

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:50,239
go uh so uh the the main the main topic

74
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,680
of of of today is kind of two two things

75
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,040
that are really one thing is the way I

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,560
think about it um so product ownership

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,159
and lean product development are

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:10,040
two different tracks of uh like um

79
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,799
entomology where it came from but really

80
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,079
they're they're they're talking about or

81
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,040
trying to solve very similar problems

82
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,880
and if we bring the ideas from both

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,560
spaces together we can um hopefully have

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,320
an even better better outcome uh because

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,320
I found some interesting information uh

86
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,600
that nine out of 10 product releases are

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,280
failures I.E they're not they're not a

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,240
success and I know you you may have a

89
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,280
product uh that is a lot more successful

90
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,360
than that that is absolutely uh possible

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,400
but I'm sure you've been part of and

92
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:55,520
seen um lot product releases that are uh

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,039
not complete successes right there's

94
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,240
quite often well some things work but

95
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:04,360
then other things not so much and this

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,919
just ties into that that idea that in

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:13,039
actual fact 70% of all startups fail in

98
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:16,120
the first year right we have ideas we

99
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,400
try and Implement them in our in our

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,240
products right or build a whole company

101
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,840
around that idea and it's

102
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,680
unsuccessful um and in fact even

103
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,479
products that companies that survived

104
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,039
the first year 50% of what that 30% that

105
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,600
survived the first year fail in the

106
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,680
first uh five years so we have a pretty

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,039
high failure rate for whole companies

108
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,639
let alone individual individual products

109
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,240
individual ideas and did even even did

110
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
the product that you created actually

111
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,840
provide the value for uh for the

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,160
organization or for the users that was

113
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,840
expected uh uh from the investment that

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,600
you made right so it's it's it's a

115
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,759
um a big deal so so why why did they

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,960
fail to meet um their objectives um and

117
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,039
there's really a I feel like a very

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,479
simple answer for that and that's

119
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,639
because the product management role is

120
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,919
is not well understood in

121
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,960
organizations it's not um well

122
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,520
implemented in organizations and quite

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,080
often

124
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,840
organizational um traditional

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,880
organizational rules impede the ility

126
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,479
for that person to be able

127
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,759
to make the decisions that need to make

128
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,560
to maximize the the the value of what it

129
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,479
is that we're trying to trying to do um

130
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,280
but also not just the organizational

131
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,000
impediments but lots of people are given

132
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,440
this this this role to manage a product

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,960
or be a product owner and they really

134
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,440
have no no idea what that is what it

135
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,680
entails or what they need to be able to

136
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:08,319
do in order to fulfill it um it's quite

137
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:10,160
I feel a a massive issue because um of

138
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,720
that of that of the scale of the amount

139
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,599
of money that's being um invested in

140
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,840
products and how much waste there is uh

141
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,840
in those IDE so I I see it a lot in

142
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,560
almost every engagement with almost

143
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,440
every customer um that I work with it's

144
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,400
very difficult to find somebody who both

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,319
understands what the product owner is

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,680
supposed to be and is and is a and is

147
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,160
able to actually fulfill it within their

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,720
organization um quite often people do

149
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
understand those that do understand what

150
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,360
they should be doing aren't actually

151
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,720
able to do it because of because of the

152
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,520
way the organization is structured or

153
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
the way the organization is is doing

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,400
things um and I have a I have a quite

155
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,400
interesting uh uh blog post I did a a

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,039
post somebody asked me I was working at

157
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,680
a customer and they asked me um like

158
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,000
what is a product owner what what what

159
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,000
are they supposed to be able to do and I

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,720
wrote a blog post that really sounded

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,800
like a CV like a like a job uh job

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,319
advert for a product owner right so I

163
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,080
created a how how do you hire a product

164
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,759
professional product owner blog post um

165
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,440
and I spread it around a lot of the the

166
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,400
the scrumbled or trainers um and other

167
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,759
people that I I recognize as having

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,759
expertise there and one of the quotes

169
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
that came back was was from Frederick

170
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,840
that made it straight into the into the

171
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:35,399
post um and I think this is a key uh

172
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,959
thing for organizations to realize um

173
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,000
and you could put product owner or

174
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,640
product manager in this space I'm going

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,080
to going to talk about why um but I love

176
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,120
this quote the product owner is a key

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,880
position that sets the tone for product

178
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,360
leadership and the definition of success

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,080
in the organization if you don't have

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,240
clear and uh concise product ownership

181
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,640
you're not going to have uh success for

182
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,000
a product you need to be working towards

183
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,360
a cohesive Vision um you might I know I

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,360
work with lots of products where the

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,440
product is big enough already or um the

186
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,160
organization finds it difficult to

187
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,920
innovate so they innovate by buying any

188
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,079
competitors that come up with good ideas

189
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,360
right and absorbing it into their own

190
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,279
product um but really those those

191
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,519
products themselves are not innovating

192
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,440
it's too hard to innovate in the product

193
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,120
um so it's very difficult to be overall

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,800
successful and that that comes to that

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,800
uh uh comment that I made about like

196
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,000
product management and product owner

197
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,079
what like does these two things what are

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,560
they there was there was never any

199
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,760
intent uh from scrum.org

200
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,680
oh not from scrum from the scrum guide

201
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,440
uh for the product owner to be um a job

202
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,760
title right it was never intended to be

203
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,560
an actual job title it's it's an

204
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,680
accountability that somebody picks up

205
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,640
and it's probably part of the overall

206
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,839
accountabilities of the organization of

207
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,839
the overall accountabilities um that

208
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,040
that person has been given by the

209
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,440
organization for their role right so

210
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,480
what I would expect to see in

211
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,120
organizations that you have a you have a

212
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,920
job role and then you're given a bunch

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,440
of little individual accountabilities

214
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,480
and the product owner is one of those

215
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,279
accountabilities and generally it's part

216
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,760
of product management so I would expect

217
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,720
somebody who is a a product owner um

218
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,680
who's fulfilling that accountability

219
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,839
within the context of scrum they would

220
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,880
be a product manager and thus they would

221
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,000
be responsible and accountable for many

222
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,200
more things within the body of product

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,800
management and that's kind of expected

224
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,560
within the context of scrum this is not

225
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,639
something that that um is

226
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,440
is if if you you as a as as an

227
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,279
individual right the product owner is

228
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,760
picking up the accountability of

229
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,399
maximizing the value return from the

230
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,959
work done by the team all the things

231
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,560
that are in product management need to

232
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:17,279
happen in order for that to be

233
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:22,360
successful right so um that's why that's

234
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,839
such an important uh um thing like

235
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,160
distinction to make when when scrum was

236
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,639
created the product owner um was an

237
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,079
unknown term right the the creators of

238
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,320
scrum picked terms that didn't have any

239
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:38,160
baggage uh product owner and scrum

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,880
Master right um but over the last 25 30

241
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,279
years uh they've picked up tons and tons

242
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,279
of baggage um so our understanding of

243
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,320
what those things are is often different

244
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,480
from what it actually is because our

245
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,120
organization has put additional things

246
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,440
into that into that story I so just be

247
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,480
careful of that because uh scrum is a

248
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,399
very specific accountability from

249
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,680
product owner so disam uate my job title

250
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,200
as product owner from the scrum

251
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,000
accountability as product owner they

252
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
might be very different things uh within

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,680
within my my organizational construct

254
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,959
because you'll go to another

255
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,399
organization and it'll be different

256
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:18,120
again right and that's that that that

257
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:22,199
difference um so this is from the the

258
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,600
pspo uh class just just highlighting the

259
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,639
the the breadth of what it is we need to

260
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,959
know it kind of expands over over as as

261
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:32,880
you go further down in this this pyramid

262
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,720
um so empiricism is obviously founding

263
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
the thing that scrum is based on is

264
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,600
trying to be an empirical process right

265
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,160
so that we have all those feedback loops

266
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,720
and all scrum the scrum guide talks

267
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,959
about is that context how do I what's

268
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,680
the minimum I need in order to maintain

269
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,760
an empirical process right that's that's

270
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,519
scrums uh uh Focus but that's not the

271
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,320
only things we need right as a as a

272
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,000
product owner um in as a product manager

273
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,240
we're going to have to add a whole bunch

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,800
of other tools and practices to our to

275
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,760
our story um some of those tools just

276
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,639
come from product management right so uh

277
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,920
things like AB testing and market

278
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,480
research and business modeling and

279
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,959
product Visions are all things that have

280
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,920
been around for a lot longer than agile

281
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,839
has um they've been around for for many

282
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,800
years uh but quite often we want to look

283
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,800
at some of those things with an with an

284
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,639
agile lens on to say how do we instead

285
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,240
of doing this all up front how do we

286
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,000
integrate it into our process uh and

287
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,800
bring it all together and that will lead

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,040
into um um the other part that I want to

289
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,600
talk about as well um the the the the

290
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,399
Leaning product

291
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,920
management so I'm sure you're all

292
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:53,680
familiar with this uh scope time budget

293
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:57,199
um this is I if if if we measure um our

294
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,680
success uh by on time on scope on budget

295
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,399
um can all of those be true

296
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,000
and we're still unsuccessful at

297
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,560
delivering value to our customer and of

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,360
course it is right we can we can deliver

299
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,880
exactly what the customer asked for and

300
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,519
exactly the time they asked for it to be

301
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,120
done on budget right for the exactly the

302
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,600
amount of money and the business has

303
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,680
changed since they made the request

304
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,199
therefore what we've created doesn't

305
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,399
fulfill fulfill the need um and that

306
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,240
happens a lot more than we would like uh

307
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,839
we kind of had blinkers on uh when we're

308
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,720
thinking about that you know oh yeah we

309
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,920
were successful we delivered that that

310
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,399
product and it's like yes but did it

311
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,759
provide the value to the customer and

312
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,079
that value um is the key should be the

313
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,800
key focus of the product owner it should

314
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,360
be the key focus of product management

315
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,959
right regardless of what it is you're

316
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,959
building and on time on scope on budget

317
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,880
is are largely irrelevant measures to to

318
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,399
to denote success in that story um there

319
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,120
are other things that we probably want

320
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:02,399
to do um but what often

321
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,880
happens um and again this is this we

322
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,079
talk about this in the the PSO class uh

323
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,199
but the the this idea of um in a

324
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,639
traditional and I use that word really

325
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,600
Loosely but traditional project

326
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,399
management uh uh practices right we have

327
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,560
H um um project Charters we have uh uh

328
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,040
plans we have times we have budgets we

329
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,160
have Scopes we have Milestones right

330
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,240
these are all part of that story it's

331
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,000
it's how our our our traditional project

332
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,279
management practices um mitigate and

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
visualize risk right that's how we

334
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,480
figure out what it is we need to do when

335
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,319
we need to do it all of those things and

336
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,120
when we start organizations start

337
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:47,399
transitioning towards a a a more scrum

338
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,240
or agile mindset um they realize that

339
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,920
they're supposed to remove those things

340
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,600
so they they take those those pillars

341
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,600
away that are supporting the the the the

342
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,880
our ability to deliver high quality

343
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,040
lowrisk products or lower risk risk

344
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,399
right lower mitigate the risk um they

345
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
remove those pillars and then they

346
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,279
forget to replace it with anything uh so

347
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,519
the the the one of the core focuses um

348
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,759
that I I like to see organizations work

349
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,240
on is what are you what are you

350
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,560
refilling those pillars with if you're

351
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,120
not going to have time and budget and

352
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,279
scope and Milestones right if you're not

353
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
going to have those things what are you

354
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,759
going to do instead how are you going to

355
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,560
create that that iterative um reflective

356
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,480
process so that you can um um build

357
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,600
build products rather than just fall on

358
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,800
your ass which is what happens when you

359
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,839
take all the pillars away and there's

360
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,759
nothing supporting uh what it is that

361
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,279
you're trying to do which is

362
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,519
and the thing that we'd like people to

363
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,560
focus on is this idea of vision value

364
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,319
and validation do you actually

365
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,920
understand where you're going and can

366
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:56,600
you communicate it do you understand

367
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,680
what value it is um that you want to

368
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,920
create right not not time budget budget

369
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,279
and scope but what is the value what is

370
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,919
the problem you're trying to solve what

371
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
is that worth to the organization are

372
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,240
you actually making progress towards it

373
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,000
um and that comes through the the

374
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,439
validation did we actually provide the

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,199
value that we thought we were going to

376
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,199
create and do we need to work

377
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,799
differently on it bringing in those

378
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,839
those those iterative incremental cycles

379
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,039
and I find most traditional

380
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,039
organizations find this very difficult

381
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:30,520
to get their head around this difference

382
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:32,919
between um the the mechanism that we use

383
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,120
in used

384
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,600
before and the mechanisms that we're

385
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,600
trying to trying to use now

386
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,720
um so bringing in some of those ideas of

387
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,240
lean product

388
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,960
development um this is this is a typical

389
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,440
typical diagram if you search for lean

390
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,840
product development online like a

391
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,000
graphic for lean product development

392
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,760
this is this is the image you're going

393
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,600
to get build measure learn right um we

394
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,960
need to we need to actually create

395
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
something in order to see whether it

396
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,400
added value we're going to measure

397
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,679
what's what's going on and then we're

398
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,799
going to analyze the data to figure out

399
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,120
you know what what what do we need to do

400
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,280
differently in order to to to close that

401
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,240
value Loop and actually deliver deliver

402
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,840
more more valuable um stuff to the

403
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,320
customer but this this is is very

404
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:29,000
familiar right there's lots of

405
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,520
implementations out there of this exact

406
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,880
same story um in the scrum world we talk

407
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,039
about inspection and adaption and

408
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,080
transparency right we need transparency

409
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,120
to see what's going on right what what

410
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,760
is it that we're actually doing and then

411
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,679
we need to look at it right there's no

412
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,039
point in having all this data that shows

413
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,640
you what's going on um and not actually

414
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,880
looking at it and then if you're going

415
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
to look at it you you want to change the

416
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,360
way you do things in order to to

417
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,559
maximize the value and all of these

418
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,559
Loops are implementing is from from

419
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,640
different uh stories around the same

420
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,960
thing all of these things are trying to

421
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:09,159
implement exactly the same thing so as

422
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,640
long as we're focusing on this idea of

423
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,520
we need to actually build something to

424
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,760
figure it out and then we need to

425
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,120
measure it like if you're missing the

426
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,200
measures you're building in the dark

427
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,320
right you're building stuff and shipping

428
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,559
it and maybe uh maybe it adds value

429
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,720
maybe it doesn't maybe it solves the

430
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,080
customer's problem maybe it doesn't uh

431
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,320
so that that that is a core core needs

432
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,760
to that to that

433
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,400
story so we've got this idea of product

434
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,799
ownership which comes from scrum right

435
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,679
although it's been adapted and adopted

436
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,919
into that terminology has been adopted

437
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,960
into lots of different practices over

438
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:50,200
the years and then we've got this idea

439
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,360
of lean right um the the the lean

440
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:57,919
movement came out of of toyoto is is

441
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:01,280
really the foundation of what scrum and

442
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,600
AD is it was based on originally it was

443
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,200
an adaptation of those techniques from

444
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,520
lean manufacturing into the world of

445
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,080
much more complex things that we're

446
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,280
creating um so that they all have a a

447
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,960
Sim similar

448
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,480
entomology um and if we we we bring

449
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,120
those things

450
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,720
together I think I've got a missing so

451
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,280
I'll just go fix it if we bring those

452
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,039
things together

453
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,280
um we really have this this H fun all of

454
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:37,600
this information all those ideas it has

455
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,799
to go through this funnel and we

456
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,400
hopefully end up squeeze out some value

457
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,039
at the end uh but what is that thing in

458
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,720
the middle that has to happen um and

459
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,280
this is something that is it's

460
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,919
implied in the scrum guide because we're

461
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,760
maximizing the value right so this is

462
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,880
implied you can't maximize value without

463
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,880
this but it's not explicit because there

464
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,640
are perhaps other ways to maximize the

465
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,919
value other than just this activity but

466
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,000
it's key I think many of you here will

467
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,640
be software focused right so it's it's

468
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,279
kind of key to our activity um and that

469
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,159
that is to to actually release you need

470
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,120
to actually release your product to real

471
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:23,320
users not pretend users not uat um the

472
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,559
only way to realize value is to actually

473
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,480
get your product in front of real users

474
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,559
and that as well is really hard for

475
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,679
organizations

476
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,039
right because they want since we've

477
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,200
we've

478
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,159
traditionally um as an industry building

479
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,080
software we've traditionally sucked at

480
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:44,760
delivering high quality product so um

481
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,279
yeah why would they trust us to deliver

482
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,559
them high quality product if we've

483
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,120
continuously and repeatedly proven that

484
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,760
we can't deliver high quality products

485
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,559
that's of use to them right so they they

486
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,080
put a whole bunch of checks and balances

487
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,520
in the way in in order to prevent us

488
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,400
wasting their money um and perhaps

489
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,240
breaking production so things like uat

490
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,799
change requests um uh

491
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,679
uh maril Lynch I used to have to fill

492
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,200
out a release form right you're going

493
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,960
You're intent Define your intent to

494
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,279
release and it had to be 6 weeks before

495
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,039
you were going to do the release

496
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:24,880
otherwise it was considered an emergency

497
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,360
release right because of the the old

498
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,559
school thinking around preventing risk

499
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,000
preventing

500
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,279
change getting into those production

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,120
environments because it's going to it's

502
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:37,159
going to break something um but in our

503
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,039
our agile thought process our lean

504
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,720
thought process we actually want to do

505
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,480
continuous small changes and hopefully

506
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,440
the changes are small enough that we

507
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,240
don't end up with a big enough fault in

508
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,559
production um that that that it causes a

509
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,960
massive fiscal problem right that which

510
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,960
is what's happened traditionally and I

511
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,919
really like um if you've not read it

512
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,679
before you should uh read uh the det

513
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,720
protecting agile BS uh article white

514
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,400
paper from the US Department of Defense

515
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,240
um I believe it's a it's a

516
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,440
key I I think it's a critical critical

517
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,360
article in our in our space that really

518
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,279
talks

519
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,559
about the thing that we don't like to

520
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,799
talk about which is are we lying to

521
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,679
ourselves about whether we're agile or

522
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,799
not right because lots of organizations

523
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,480
will tell you they're agile they'll tell

524
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,440
you they do things in an agile way but

525
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,080
when you start asking them questions

526
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,919
about whether people can change the

527
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,039
process that they work under or whether

528
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,159
they can change the backlog or whether

529
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,520
they can actually talk to customers or

530
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,679
whether they can ship their product to

531
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,440
production on a regular basis um or

532
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,559
whether they even understand what it is

533
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,120
they're working on and what they're

534
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,600
working towards and these all of these

535
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,159
things are not true in their

536
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,320
organization or many of those things are

537
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,760
not true which affect ly negates their

538
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,799
ability to claim that they're agile

539
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
right um and I kind of like I I always

540
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,320
use this image which is the the kind of

541
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,919
litmus test that that article provides

542
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,080
you're either all of these things are

543
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,679
true or it's it's agile BS um it's a

544
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,520
pretty harsh lipus test but not many

545
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,520
organizations actually actually succeed

546
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,320
at it um but this is the lipus test that

547
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,360
um US Department of Defense procurement

548
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,440
officers are supposed to use when

549
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,679
evaluating a vendor's ability uh uh to

550
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,679
engage on a product um so they're

551
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,240
spending your money right that's that's

552
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,640
the thing if if somebody's spending your

553
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,559
money that that you almost can't have

554
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,399
too harsh uh a set of a set of checks uh

555
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,279
uh to put in there so I just zoom in a

556
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:50,399
little bit so these are these are

557
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:52,799
they're really really important and I

558
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,960
think um I've I've a few of you might

559
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
have been um at I've done this at

560
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,720
conferences where I've got everybody in

561
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,720
the room to to stand up uh or on Virtual

562
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,200
and put their hand up um and I I go

563
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,159
through each question and ask them to

564
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,480
sit down or put their hand down if if

565
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,320
it's not true right um for their

566
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,840
organization as as a whole right it

567
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,440
might be true for one product in an

568
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,240
organization but in the organization as

569
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,919
a whole is it is it true um and even I

570
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,600
did a devops conference in vinnus um 500

571
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,120
people in the room and at the end of all

572
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,240
all six of these questions there was

573
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,720
only two people left standing at the end

574
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,919
that could say all of those things true

575
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
uh we're we're half arsing half arsing

576
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:37,919
our implementations absolutely half

577
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,840
arsing them um and we need to recognize

578
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,960
that we are rather than telling the

579
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,120
business that we're agile because the

580
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,080
business doesn't necessarily understand

581
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,600
that we're actually not but because

582
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,880
we're lying to ourselves we're also

583
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,360
lying to them right that that that's

584
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,799
that for me is a is a is a big

585
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,679
deal uh so uh this idea of customer uh

586
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,520
centricity or centricity we need to we

587
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
need to all be on the same page we need

588
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,520
to be all focusing towards the same

589
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,840
thing that's my my my idea here and I

590
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,679
have a couple of things that I think are

591
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,960
quite important to consider that are

592
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,279
often not

593
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,720
considered um and one of my favorite

594
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:21,320
pieces is is this value um pyramid

595
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,679
there's a there's a b2c version and a

596
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,120
B2B right it depends whether your Apple

597
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,120
on the left or your um I don't know

598
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Microsoft on the right that are selling

599
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:37,760
B2B Solutions

600
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:40,200
um these value P pyramids are about um

601
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,880
connecting people that are using your

602
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,559
product to what it is you're trying to

603
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,919
achieve with your product and that's why

604
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:51,440
um Apple was the Roaring success that it

605
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,200
was right because they they convinced

606
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,640
everybody not necessarily everybody but

607
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,279
many people to care about their products

608
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,480
people don't queue up outside of an

609
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,360
Apple store to buy for 2 days camping

610
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,360
out to buy a new version of the product

611
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,440
because because it's just a product I'm

612
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,039
going to buy it right they they it's

613
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,520
because they care they care about the

614
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,760
company they care about the vision of

615
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,080
the company they care about what the

616
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,559
Company's trying to achieve they want to

617
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,159
support that company in what it is doing

618
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:26,159
because we believe in the message that

619
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,520
you're trying to trying to present um

620
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,840
and that's one of of the core

621
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,840
superpowers of the product owner is

622
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,360
getting people to care about what it is

623
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,720
you're creating because I I'll tell you

624
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,600
this now that that that people doing

625
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,279
work don't do it very well when they

626
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,399
don't care about the outcomes of that

627
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:49,480
work when they're they're the the like

628
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,120
if I if I if I don't I don't care about

629
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,799
the thing that I'm trying to achieve how

630
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,799
much effort am I actually going to put

631
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,799
into

632
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:59,039
it not as much as I would if I actually

633
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,960
cared as if I'm actually trying I

634
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,559
actually want it to be successful I'm

635
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,320
actually connected to that product and

636
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,600
the same is true that's for for for

637
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,440
employees working on your product and

638
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,480
working towards the success of your

639
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,760
product but it's also true from the

640
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,960
customer side as well right are your

641
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,120
customers engaged with your products do

642
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,000
they care about the value that it's

643
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,919
providing them right your product helps

644
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,559
me do my job better therefore I care

645
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,880
about your product is it actually

646
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,279
helping me or do I if if I feel like you

647
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,080
don't care then I'm probably not going

648
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,799
to care either it's a whole whole um bit

649
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,360
that's missing from a lot of product

650
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,880
management a lot of that that focus and

651
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,679
you see out there organizations that are

652
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,039
doing this really well uh Spotify have

653
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,720
done this very well in the past um

654
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,240
Microsoft are starting to do this uh

655
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,440
well they've done it badly in the past

656
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,200
Apple have been doing it well for years

657
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,360
right there's lots of organizations out

658
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,799
there that are definitely examples of

659
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,720
not only product management but turning

660
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:01,480
around uh their their their previous

661
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,919
efforts at at at product management to

662
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,159
make it a better place

663
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,919
um and one of those things remember in

664
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,440
the the the the do measure learn we need

665
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,200
to measure right we need to measure

666
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,240
what's happening in our product we need

667
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:21,000
to measure what we're working towards we

668
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,159
need to really understand um the the

669
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,159
metrics which they don't make our

670
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:27,960
decisions for us but they do inform uh

671
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,480
the decisions that we make

672
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,240
uh so this is this is just an example

673
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,679
this is one of the measurement uh uh

674
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,039
systems out there evidence-based

675
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,880
management uh which has these four key

676
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,440
value areas that you should try and have

677
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,279
at least some measure in each of those

678
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,320
key value areas uh to try and make sure

679
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,960
you're not missing something right uh

680
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,840
current value is your product that

681
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,960
exists unrealized value is what should

682
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,159
be on your backlog ability to innovate

683
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,519
um is is how much time do you spend

684
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,399
actually making new stuff rather than

685
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,880
struggling with complexity and time to

686
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,159
Market is how quick quickly you can

687
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,320
actually get stuff out there so that

688
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:06,000
goes to you know uh supporting current

689
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,600
customers opening up new markets um

690
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,559
maintaining our ability to to to to to

691
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,840
create stuff and getting stuff out to

692
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,000
customers as quickly as possible um and

693
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,600
that's this the whole Quality quality

694
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,919
picture as well which I think is is

695
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,120
super valuable so if you're not familiar

696
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
with evidence-based management it's

697
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,799
definitely worth a look if you're

698
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,159
already familiar with it you probably

699
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,679
already know what you're what you're not

700
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,919
doing or what you're missing from your

701
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,840
from your story

702
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:34,760
um but it's always a good uh example and

703
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,519
set up um and on kind of to do with the

704
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,559
value perament um the next most

705
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,039
important thing to be uh uh focused on

706
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,600
to have everybody on the same page for

707
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,000
is is goals Vision uh um and goals right

708
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
where is it you're going what is it

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
you're trying to achieve does every

710
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:58,399
single person working on every single

711
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,080
part of your product actually understand

712
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,639
the work that they're doing today and

713
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,480
how it connects to the

714
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:09,559
overall outcomes of the product right

715
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,919
providing value and this goes partly to

716
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:15,360
that if you're focusing on people um you

717
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,360
know Dan Pink's Drive autonomy Mastery

718
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,880
and purpose this goes directly to

719
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,559
purpose right are do

720
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,080
people see how their work contributes to

721
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,480
the overall outcomes and that that's

722
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,120
really important that's also on the dod

723
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,519
um um article as well your Sprint goal

724
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,279
and your product goal and your vision

725
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,639
are tools to help people make those

726
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,440
connections they're tools for the

727
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,799
product owner to engage people and help

728
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,080
them uh uh uh a product management as

729
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,639
well um to gain that

730
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,480
understanding so uh I'm over how long I

731
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,880
wanted to be Joanna did warn me that I

732
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,440
had uh too much content but if you've

733
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,919
been to my presentations before which I

734
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,200
know some of you have you'll know I

735
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,240
always have too much stuff take too long

736
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,960
but I just have uh uh we're on the home

737
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,639
straight I have some challenges uh that

738
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,720
I've mentioned I just want to summarize

739
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:10,159
some and maybe introduce a few more um

740
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,960
one of the huge challenges in

741
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,360
organizations for product owners and

742
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,120
product management is

743
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,440
influence do you as a product owner or

744
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,279
product manager have the influence that

745
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,039
you need in an organization in order to

746
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:27,440
be successful do you do do you have

747
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:29,679
control I I I've got a little example

748
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,399
diagram um I use this one in the product

749
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,720
owner class we do some exercises with it

750
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,200
um here's one I've filled out right um

751
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,159
and this is where each of those I feel

752
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,639
each of those things would go for a

753
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,360
professional scrum team right an

754
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:45,639
organization that's invested in

755
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,639
professional scrum so you can see theyve

756
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,039
got the organization uh what they

757
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:52,200
influence uh the product owner and the

758
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,480
developers I've probably been a little

759
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,399
bit harsh uh to the organization but um

760
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,799
in in in this story you can see that

761
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:08,360
things like uh uh budget and uh um

762
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:10,440
Marketplace and customers and uh all the

763
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,720
stakeholders and competition are all

764
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,320
within the influence of the product

765
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,760
owner although some of it's within the

766
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,840
influence of the organization and some

767
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,919
of it's within the influence of the

768
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,600
developers right so from a product

769
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,559
owner's perspective are you able to

770
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:28,519
influence the budget right because if

771
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,679
you believe that a new thing is worth it

772
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,799
um does the organization trust you to

773
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,320
give you the money to to to to invest in

774
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,840
it and see if it is worth it right or do

775
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,399
they not uh lots of good stories about

776
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,960
how this this has this has changed in a

777
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,919
lot of organizations um organization I

778
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,840
work with which is a massive

779
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,760
organization that has massive Hardware

780
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,039
costs and I mean big big machines like

781
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,720
hundreds of millions of dollars for

782
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,480
machines has just pushed responsibility

783
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,039
all the way down to the shop floor for

784
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,679
purchasing of any amount of money so

785
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,559
somebody on a shop floor who needs to

786
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,240
replace a machine because it's it's worn

787
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:10,200
out they can approve $200 million spend

788
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,240
to go replace that machine because they

789
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,679
understand what the machine is doing and

790
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,520
how it works some bean counter up in

791
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,480
leadership somewhere doesn't understand

792
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,040
the ramifications and might deny that

793
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,919
request cuz it's not in their budget for

794
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,560
the year um so so that's really

795
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:26,200
important that people are able to do the

796
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,639
things and that's about influence right

797
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,839
can you influence those those decisions

798
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,760
and this is like this the scrum agile

799
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,760
story of where does influence sit um and

800
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,480
who influences what very very important

801
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,639
I think uh the other one that I

802
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,839
mentioned before uh the the 3vs vision

803
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,399
value in validation are missing like I

804
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,119
can't find them where are they uh in in

805
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,919
an organization um because once you've

806
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,119
you've come along and got rid of the the

807
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,240
yearly budgets Milestones um and those

808
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,359
older um Tech techniques for managing

809
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,599
risk what are you replacing with if

810
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,000
you're not replacing with anything

811
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,680
you're just

812
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,440
broken um and metrics what are you

813
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,839
measuring and not just what are you

814
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,280
measuring at the product level at the

815
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,200
feature level what do you what do you me

816
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,920
what are you measuring holistically in

817
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:21,320
your product right not at the individual

818
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,839
feature level and I find so so often

819
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,119
these these measures are just missing

820
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,520
they're just gone nobody nobody has uh a

821
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,680
clue how much the product costs to make

822
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,760
they don't have a clue what the revenue

823
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,280
is um if this these things are not

824
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,119
intrinsically understood throughout the

825
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,359
product structure how can the people who

826
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,320
are making the decisions every

827
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,000
day possibly affect the best decision

828
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,440
they possibly can if they don't

829
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,880
understand the the the the cost the

830
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,599
value what customers think of the

831
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,839
products you need to understand all of

832
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,359
these key

833
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:58,800
indicators and then uh scaling is a

834
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:01,960
massive absolutely massive problem that

835
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,599
organizations have um because they they

836
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,520
scale crap that's what they scale you

837
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,640
know we we've we've got purly performing

838
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,359
teams who do don't understand our

839
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,240
product because they don't have any any

840
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,200
any metrics they don't understand they

841
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,920
don't have goals they don't have a a

842
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,079
vision they're not aligned and yet we

843
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,839
decide to put 20 teams together to build

844
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:26,200
a product um and think it's going to be

845
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,880
awesome um if you scale mediocrity you

846
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,599
get even worse than mediocrity right you

847
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,280
you need to scale awesome you need

848
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,640
amazing teams who are really good at

849
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,680
doing what they do because as soon as

850
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,960
you put multiple teams working on a

851
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,319
product together you're going to add

852
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,760
complexity you're going to add inhibit

853
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,079
their ability to deliver value so they

854
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,000
have to be the best they possibly can be

855
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,920
before before they even they even get

856
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,920
there otherwise it's just going to be a

857
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,800
disaster

858
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:05,960
so that was that was um everything I had

859
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,839
for today so I'm interested in what

860
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,000
questions you have so I'm going to stop

861
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,640
sharing and I'll bring that back over

862
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,839
here there we go I went I went a little

863
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:23,200
bit over Joanna little bit tiny bit like

864
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,720
small end like a very small end yeah um

865
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,119
so Carla Carla had a question there or

866
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,000
it was just the latest one I saw there's

867
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,160
quite a few questions let me go back uh

868
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,359
no Carla is the longest ago so that was

869
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,079
31 minutes ago on my 18-minute talk so

870
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:38,200
Carla that was before I even started no

871
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,599
it wasn't it wasn't cuz I was I took too

872
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,880
long um so what is fail in that context

873
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,000
um it's not actually provide I would say

874
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,119
it's not actually providing

875
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,079
value to the

876
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:55,079
customer or Li of limited value

877
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,920
not

878
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,440
not solving their problem is

879
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,800
probably the closest I would get feel

880
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,640
free to come off mute everybody can can

881
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,800
can can come mute and Chim in chime in

882
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,880
um May

883
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,960
I I have my own I I have my own

884
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,040
definition of failure in general if you

885
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,400
fail to learn then Houston you are in

886
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,240
the biggest problems because in fact if

887
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,560
we look into the data well in my opinion

888
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,680
it's not reasonable to fight with data

889
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,359
pretend that the data is telling us the

890
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,359
opposite right many companies fail many

891
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,520
ideas fail the best companies that I

892
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,680
know personally they are masters of

893
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,720
learning and treating every single

894
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,800
problem every single bad decision as an

895
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,160
opportunity to improve and to make

896
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:54,280
future decisions better so in that case

897
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,560
I would say learning is an important

898
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,640
part of agility and looking for a for a

899
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,800
success in the future I I agree one of

900
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,280
my favorite quotes is from Sati and

901
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,480
Adela um and I'm going to try it off off

902
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,720
the cuff but he said he would rather

903
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,920
have his his best people and his best

904
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:17,319
Engineers working on the problems of how

905
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,400
to make everybody more effective that

906
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:23,800
learning piece um than working on new

907
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,800
features he'd rather have everybody

908
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,280
working on our own Effectiveness um he

909
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,640
called it productivity right but

910
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,079
leadership our own productivity than um

911
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,960
than adding actual features because if

912
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,400
you maximize your productivity you can

913
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,640
come back and add as many features as

914
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,280
you like and it's easy to add features

915
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,000
uh so definitely focusing on the right

916
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:49,960
thing is quite important oh Carla's got

917
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,480
all the questions um how how do you work

918
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,839
with an organization who is fixed on the

919
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,200
idea of having a product manager and

920
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:03,200
product owners and in a way seeing POS

921
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,160
more as backlog admins but not really as

922
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,960
a decision I I know I think I I know

923
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,000
where you're going with that um it just

924
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,480
sucks uh they're not really product

925
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,839
owners they're they're they're they're

926
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,040
admins they're product backlog admins

927
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,079
right which is not the same thing as

928
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,440
product owners it sounds like the true

929
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,599
product owner might be the product

930
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:30,520
manager who who then is delegating to a

931
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,200
scribe who's writing things down for the

932
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,640
as the product owner um and that we're

933
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,920
we're just not going to get the value we

934
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,680
expect I I don't know if you've seen um

935
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,280
there's a graph I'm going to try and

936
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,400
describe it but it's it's got um how

937
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,119
much how much value you're able to

938
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,720
create and time and if if you're doing

939
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,599
you're doing traditional right we're

940
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,960
going to deliver once at the end then

941
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,319
you've got that flat line of of we've

942
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,400
not delivered any value and then we

943
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,520
deliver all the value at the end the end

944
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,079
um and if we get onto

945
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,960
that um we're asking for a whole bunch

946
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,839
of stuff up front which I think is kind

947
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,960
of like what what you're talking about

948
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:11,000
it doesn't seem like that product owner

949
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,680
that that team has the ability to change

950
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,680
what it is they're working on right

951
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,640
because it's coming from on high product

952
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,440
managers have decided that these are the

953
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,920
20 things we need to deliver right so if

954
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,880
we're if we're delivering those 20

955
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,760
things but all we can control for

956
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,960
example is the order and the breakdown

957
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,040
of those things then we still have to

958
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,440
get to the same point as the traditional

959
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,319
but it's probably a slopey line you're

960
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,000
delivering a little bit of value all the

961
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,800
time as you go forward so you can at

962
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,520
least engage your stakeholders you're

963
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,400
getting a little bit more but in order

964
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,640
to really maximize that value you you

965
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,880
have to be able to change what you're

966
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,040
working on because businesses make

967
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,599
different decisions every day does that

968
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:56,760
make sense Carla I see yes thank you I I

969
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,440
was more looking for uh

970
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,480
what what would be the suggestions to

971
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,960
make to the organization or what kind of

972
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,880
proof can you show more uh more in that

973
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,720
sense that this this hierarchy of

974
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,440
product manager and the ler the slaves

975
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,480
you call product owners to work with the

976
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,480
scrome teams it it is not working out so

977
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,040
what kind of information you provide

978
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,119
them because this the situation is that

979
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,720
the product managers do not want to

980
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,480
interact with the scrum teams which

981
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,800
would be the best

982
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,559
situation yeah I definitely I definitely

983
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:39,720
feel feel feel you there um

984
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:42,319
speed on the the the

985
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,440
the traditional decision-making

986
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:48,079
processes in organ so this is completely

987
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,280
not to do with scrum and agile right

988
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,160
traditional decision- making uh has

989
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,480
decisions made at the top and doing done

990
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
at the bottom but the people people at

991
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,880
the bottom that are doing are the people

992
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,720
that are actually connected directly to

993
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,520
the

994
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,280
market so um something needs to be

995
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,720
painful enough for those people for them

996
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,520
to escalate it and at every level

997
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,440
escalate it to somebody who can make the

998
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,319
decision like your your product manager

999
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,599
might only be two or three up maybe it's

1000
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,599
only two up and then they have to

1001
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,880
instruct their

1002
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,079
subordinates in a way that they actually

1003
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,839
understand and they don't just don't

1004
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,079
just go oh yeah whatever right we're

1005
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,640
busy

1006
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,400
um and it has to be painful enough for

1007
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,599
them escalated enough it needs to be a

1008
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,760
big enough deal for for that information

1009
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,200
to then trickle down and a change to be

1010
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,119
made and that that takes too long it

1011
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,520
takes far too long it can take weeks or

1012
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:45,800
months for those things to happen and

1013
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,119
what's the cost of delay of not being

1014
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,520
able to respond the Market's

1015
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,520
changed and our competitors can change

1016
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,720
faster than we can what's what's that

1017
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,240
cost if you happen to be in a market

1018
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,680
where none of your

1019
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,880
competitors are are are changing faster

1020
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,119
if you're changing faster than your

1021
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,599
competitors you're probably doing okay

1022
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,839
right you could always work a little bit

1023
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,359
faster but you're doing okay companies

1024
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,599
don't change unless there's a reason to

1025
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,079
change it's going to cost money to

1026
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:14,599
change right investment so um you need

1027
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:16,559
to find is there a competitor that's

1028
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,680
taking our business away and and focus

1029
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,240
on that we need to be faster than them

1030
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,359
right uh

1031
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:26,640
Richard oh Rickard sorry Rickard I just

1032
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,079
yeah hey Martin hey Joanna yeah um

1033
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,079
I'm also thinking about if you have a

1034
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,680
product man I mean a product owner who's

1035
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,760
kind of the Scribe of the product

1036
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,079
manager there's a risk that you lose

1037
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,920
transparency transparency in theirs too

1038
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,680
because you have one people this a

1039
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,480
whisper game right you have one people

1040
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,559
telling another PE another some other

1041
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,960
guy what to what to do and he just yeah

1042
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,520
that's what you told me and there's

1043
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,200
might be some misom miscommunication

1044
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,839
there and that will increase the will

1045
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,240
that

1046
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:58,040
will uh yeah risk transparency in in the

1047
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,839
whole process right yeah it's I totally

1048
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:04,760
agree totally agree Rickard um yes Danna

1049
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,640
if I may uh well from practical point of

1050
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,559
view because I believe Carla was also

1051
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,160
looking for some piece of advice um in

1052
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:15,119
my experience you will not sell the idea

1053
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,640
talking about what we are having right

1054
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:23,680
now like transparency you need to find a

1055
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,359
pain Point H and what I love doing I'm

1056
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:29,200
waiting for an opportunity when for

1057
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:32,040
instance those product managers making

1058
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,119
decisions they feel overwhelmed because

1059
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,040
when they will be in this pain moment

1060
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,640
there might be an opportunity to tell

1061
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,920
them hey what about a small experiment

1062
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,520
what will happen if you create some more

1063
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,880
space you will allow those product

1064
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,400
owners to make more decisions in a

1065
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,160
certain area just for the Sprint just in

1066
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,599
that case let's create constraints for

1067
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,079
that process and then we we will come

1068
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,200
back it's just an experiment right we

1069
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,319
are not asking you to now change

1070
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,800
everything in the company check whether

1071
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:11,000
it will work because thanks to that you

1072
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,760
will gain more more time for other stuff

1073
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,079
obviously there's too much on your table

1074
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:19,400
and let's see what will happen for this

1075
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,400
scrum team so that might be also an

1076
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,440
opportunity to create small steps and

1077
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,319
help product owners get more more

1078
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,599
empowerment in the

1079
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,640
organization you you know the fun thing

1080
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:37,119
is that this little kingdom of herchies

1081
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,800
came because as a solution to remove the

1082
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:43,240
overwhelm from product

1083
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,720
managers yeah yeah and then now we have

1084
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:48,200
a different set of problems but anyway

1085
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,520
but but yeah it's a highlighting the the

1086
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,680
pain points is is a great great advice

1087
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,640
there are so

1088
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,480
many I I I agree Carla that that pushing

1089
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,640
people into ability B based groups

1090
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:06,480
really creates those it maximizes silos

1091
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,480
right um yeah it's hard it's hard but

1092
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,079
when you are a silo it means that you

1093
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,839
will have your pains trust me if you

1094
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,599
haven't experience that and here comes

1095
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:22,480
the opportunity to talk for different

1096
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:25,760
ideas uh cool I'm just uh reading that

1097
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,640
other question from gam I'm prob

1098
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,680

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,920
glad H do you he was kind he was kind

1102
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,599
Martin kind yeah um do you have

1103
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,319
recommendations on how to phrase frame

1104
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,760
strategic goal for a product we often

1105
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,880
see product goals defined as we will

1106
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,839
Implement X capability or

1107
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,359
workflow um we we go yeah we go from

1108
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:57,720
product Vision straight to feature list

1109
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,720
um it

1110
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:05,200
the the the bit where I think you're

1111
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:06,160
going to get traction there is when cuz

1112
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,319
they're going to they're going to

1113
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,800
they're going to struggle

1114
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,240
to this is true for for Sprint goal as

1115
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,480
well they're going to struggle to say

1116
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,480
one

1117
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,880
thing right if when you see a Sprint

1118
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,359
goal that's deliver these 10 things or

1119
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,240
even three things here's three things

1120
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,720
that we're going to do this Sprint or

1121
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,440
you see a product goal that's the same

1122
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,440
or the the group struggles to create

1123
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,480
that Focus for it's because they're

1124
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,760
they're looking too low level right like

1125
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,520
you're saying they're they're looking at

1126
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,880
that feature level and deciding on

1127
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,839
features and the features inform the

1128
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,520
goal because they're working backwards

1129
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:47,040
they're focused on what it is they're

1130
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,720
delivering right and then they're coming

1131
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,480
up to a why are we working on this and

1132
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:55,400
that's the wrong way around you need to

1133
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,640
think about why are we delivering this

1134
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,960
what what are we what like what are we

1135
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,119
trying to achieve and that informs the

1136
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,359
contents of your backlog not the other

1137
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,280
way around your backlog doesn't create

1138
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:10,359
the goals your goals create the backlog

1139
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,880
so you can you can do a test and say

1140
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:13,559
what is it we're trying to achieve as an

1141
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,520
organization with this

1142
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,280
product right that's our that's our

1143
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,559
vision right what is it we're trying to

1144
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,880
achieve why are we here then and as a as

1145
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,359
a simple statement then come up with

1146
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,680
what's our first what's the first step

1147
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,559
that we could take towards that that

1148
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,240
would be your product goal and then you

1149
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:34,839
look at your backlog and say what have

1150
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:37,440
we got in here that works towards this

1151
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:39,079
oh nothing well we're not working on the

1152
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,359
right thing right we don't have the

1153
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:45,960
right stuff in our in our backlog so so

1154
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:49,119
trying it is a trap it is absolutely a

1155
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,240
trap um to decide on your goals based on

1156
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,960
your

1157
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:55,240
backlog because it's that's that's you

1158
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,520
still might be working on the wrong

1159
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,520
thing

1160
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:04,559
and and is there a specific format that

1161
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,880
you would recommend that would force us

1162
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,160
to I'm thinking we typically use value

1163
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,079
trees to you know Express this is my

1164
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,480
product and this is what I I'm going to

1165
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,880
focus on right if I could enforce a

1166
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,680
format for my business goals presumably

1167
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,960
that will force people to think business

1168
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,240
as opposed to feature if you see what I

1169
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,160
mean if if your goal doesn't fit this

1170
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:34,000
specific format it's probably not a good

1171
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,040
goal does that make sense it it it does

1172
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,040
and there are there are lots of tools

1173
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,559
out there for for creating writing goals

1174
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,839
um I'm working with an organization just

1175
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:47,400
now that uses

1176
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:50,799
okrs um also smart goals I did a a blog

1177
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,559
post recently um gulam on on how to

1178
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:56,079
write goals how to how to write good

1179
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:59,599
goals it might help also might not

1180
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,319
answer your question directly uh but I

1181
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:04,559
think this is something that everybody

1182
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:08,000
struggles with and Joan and I normally

1183
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,760
do like a yeah fast goals we we nor

1184
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,400
normally do a work a workshop with the

1185
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,640
leadership team to figure out what those

1186
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,319
goals are because only they know right

1187
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,760
um and so it's something that you can do

1188
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:24,640
yourself as well with your team is

1189
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,400
is have you ever done um we do exercises

1190
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,520
sometimes like cre a product box that's

1191
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,400
a great exercise to have people align on

1192
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,160
what is it we're trying to achieve if

1193
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,960
your product was going to sit on a shelf

1194
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,920
in the supermarket and you had to

1195
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,359
encourage people to pick it up what

1196
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,559
would the box look like and what would

1197
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,079
it say on

1198
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:43,680
it right that that that's that's the

1199
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,079
what are we trying to achieve how do we

1200
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,640
create a vision and then connect the

1201
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,960
people with that vision and creating

1202
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,520
that box doing that creative Endeavor

1203
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,440
together of creating that box can be a

1204
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,160
great way to get everybody aligned on on

1205
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,280
what it is and if they're sitting there

1206
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,160
arguing about what features should be on

1207
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,119
the back of the box they're not aligned

1208
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,319
right you can you can see that right

1209
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,559
away um and I know lots of organizations

1210
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,480
struggle with that because especially I

1211
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:11,559
I know your organization quite well um

1212
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
that that some of the products are

1213
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:16,000
pretty big right so when it's a really

1214
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,319
big product it's difficult to get that

1215
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,359
that vision and I would point it I know

1216
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,680
you guys use as your devops um think

1217
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,799
think of what as your devops did to

1218
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:28,319
solve that problem they they broke the

1219
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:31,440
product down into Azure boards Azure

1220
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:35,520
repos um Azure pipelines right here's

1221
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,520
key value chains that we can understand

1222
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,839
and compartmentalize a little bit and

1223
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,680
kind of say this is what we're working

1224
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,119
towards here or you know we can look at

1225
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,920
the market for that we can look at

1226
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:49,319
within the the the bounds of that which

1227
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,319
sounds like what you're doing anyway

1228
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,240
right don't know if that help thanks it

1229
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,559
does

1230
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,119
thanks

1231
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,480
ah and then the last question there the

1232
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:05,000
most recent one um it's kind of in

1233
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,680
reverse order was from again from Carla

1234
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Carla you've got all the questions um

1235
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,850
scaling Champion I've been paying

1236
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,680
attention you see I haven't been

1237
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:18,160
[Laughter]

1238
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:20,359
multitasking uh so scaling um the

1239
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,680
argument is very valid most people will

1240
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:24,440
understand

1241
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,480
it uh when it comes to life when the

1242
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,799
time keeps running it's not feasible to

1243
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,400
wait if I maybe if I explain you because

1244
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:34,280
I I wrote it maybe too quick so um when

1245
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,400
you were saying about scaling you

1246
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,720
mentioned that if you scale the things

1247
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,520
that are not working then you're going

1248
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,480
to create a monster and this argument

1249
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,079
everyone would understand it and

1250
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,280
actually everyone understands that we're

1251
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:49,200
not if we're not able to do things right

1252
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,880
in the small scale when we scale we get

1253
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:56,559
into big troubles however it the the the

1254
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,440
the argument that comes back to this

1255
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,640
very valid logic is that sure in paper

1256
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,839
is is understandable but in real life

1257
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,040
where the tank is running and we're

1258
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,240
pressured by market customers and so on

1259
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,160
so forth we just can't wait for the

1260
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:17,440
teams to get a little bit better we just

1261
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,920
need to get better as we do what do you

1262
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,960
do to that or how do you manage this

1263
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,960
situation yeah because the problem is

1264
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,319
and yet we continue to suck right yeah

1265
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,079
yeah

1266
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,559
and yet we continue to suck we continue

1267
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:32,400
to fail to to deliver we continue to

1268
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,720
fail to have a cohesive high quality

1269
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,079
product right and and it it's the very

1270
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,200
definition of of of insanity Rickard

1271
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,400
might have something I know he works

1272
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,400
with an organization with lots of

1273
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,559
teams yes so what we're looking at is is

1274
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,720
is we're not trying we're not trying to

1275
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:53,640
scale we're trying to descale how can we

1276
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,559
simplify this we have enough complexity

1277
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:00,200
as it is business rules

1278
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,799
architecture and whatnot how are how can

1279
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,359
we simplify this and that can be both

1280
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:09,680
technical uh it can be organizational it

1281
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:11,920
can be just alignment across lines of

1282
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,079
business right so I think that's that's

1283
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:17,760
your first protocol how can we

1284
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:20,319
descale because that will buy you so

1285
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,760
much more than trying to scale up if you

1286
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:25,680
ask me and that that's that's the first

1287
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:29,520
thing we talk about in the the aling

1288
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:33,680
scrum class right because it it it's

1289
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,000
it's it's much more complicated to have

1290
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,359
multiple groups of people working

1291
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,920
together so how can we how can we

1292
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:40,039
descale our product and I think that

1293
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,359
when I was talking to to gilam about

1294
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:44,680
Azure devops that's how they descaled

1295
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:46,440
right you've got this massive product

1296
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,520
but if we say Azure boards is not as

1297
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,000
massive as that Azure repos is not as

1298
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,000
massive as that instead of having 42

1299
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,799
teams working on one product as your

1300
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,200
boards only has six teams okay well six

1301
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,720
te teams is may be M much more

1302
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,720
manageable than 42 teams right um and

1303
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,480
and that that value chain that allows

1304
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:08,240
you to to to make those decisions is is

1305
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:11,359
is is a good way to do that but but

1306
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,559
also I was just going to suggest Carla

1307
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:18,359
that that um this the Satia quote that I

1308
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:20,760
had from the CEO of Microsoft again if

1309
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:22,079
you have lots of teams already which are

1310
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,760
working on a product which is where

1311
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,720
Microsoft was right they have have

1312
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,480
Windows and they have devops these are

1313
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:33,039
all big products uh office um they they

1314
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,880
they change the focus from value

1315
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:38,240
delivery to Quality

1316
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,880
delivery and even with a focus and I

1317
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,400
have some data around that that you can

1318
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:47,000
have even with a focus on Purely on

1319
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,799
building up our Effectiveness the Azure

1320
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,039
devops team uh went from in one year it

1321
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,359
went from 12 features to production each

1322
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,599
year with the same number of people uh

1323
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,480
to 68 features to production by the end

1324
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:02,319
of that year and they weren't focused on

1325
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,599
value delivery they were focused on

1326
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,520
improving our

1327
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,359
Effectiveness so there's good data out

1328
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:11,880
there that shows that if you focus on

1329
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,839
improving your processes on improving

1330
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,119
the way you do things of paying back

1331
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,359
your technical debt of just fix the

1332
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:20,119
stuff that's

1333
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,839
wrong you get the dividends right and

1334
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:26,599
the Dividends are more features in your

1335
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:29,039
product may I share another story so I

1336
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:32,440
remember working with a customer that

1337
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:38,640
was not so big it was a company of

1338
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:41,680
around 20 150 people and uh CEO once

1339
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,920
asked why we are not getting more value

1340
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:47,079
and we are hiring more and more people

1341
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,200
why I don't see great results in the end

1342
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:52,319
of the day and we conducted some

1343
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,839
experiments and started Gathering

1344
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:56,440
metrics and you know what what was the

1345
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:58,799
result of our

1346
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:03,400
finding at least

1347
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:08,520
50% of time efforts people were were in

1348
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:11,680
their jobs was just business as usual so

1349
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:15,559
it w it was meaningless to add more and

1350
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:18,079
more people to doing business as usual

1351
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:20,599
while there were great opportunities to

1352
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,839
automate there were great opportunities

1353
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:25,319
to rethink how we work and with just

1354
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:28,079
small steps

1355
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:30,520
suddenly the overall effectiveness

1356
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,640
productivity has started to

1357
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,599
improve would would you uh Y and Martin

1358
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,039
Shar I don't know how you're going to

1359
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:40,079
share the link for the recording but

1360
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,799
together with that if you have this kind

1361
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,640
of um examples on how focusing on

1362
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:48,400
Effectiveness or or the kind of metrics

1363
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:51,280
you were using to to measure uh the ways

1364
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,760
of working that will throw results that

1365
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,799
you know you you need to start looking

1366
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,680
to the to to this scaling thing as a as

1367
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,400
if it's the boogie monster and still

1368
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:02,480
doing something

1369
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,039
else we we'll definitely do that I yes I

1370
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,079
don't know yet how we'll share the

1371
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:07,559
recording that's my next job when we get

1372
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,520
off is to go look into how does that

1373
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:14,440
work with this platform again first time

1374
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:16,640
I've used it um but uh uh evidence-based

1375
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,319
management the ebm guide is a great

1376
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,839
place to start it has a bunch of example

1377
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:25,160
metrics in it it has an appendix uh uh

1378
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:26,839
with a whole bunch of of of

1379
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,520
places to start right they might not be

1380
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:30,079
the right metrics for you but here's

1381
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,480
here's a place to start and it focuses

1382
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:35,559
on a commercial product um but yeah lots

1383
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,599
of lots of good stuff in there um but

1384
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:41,559
we'll we'll put together a a package and

1385
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:44,000
we'll email when we send out the link um

1386
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:47,000
we'll put together whatever whatever

1387
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,839
that looks like I'll figure that

1388
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,319
out yes so I already posted the link to

1389
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:54,799
evidencebased management guide earlier

1390
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:56,760
if you don't know that and in the end

1391
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:59,680
there are the examples that Martin was

1392
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:03,039
mentioned uh I can I believe I can give

1393
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,400
you my own ideas and briefly uh briefly

1394
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,839
write this experiment that I conducted

1395
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,200
with one one of the companies and we had

1396
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:15,640
those interesting results that were you

1397
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,839
know changing completely the

1398
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,079
perspective I just wondered H can

1399
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,799
everybody see the chat yes yes awesome

1400
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:25,760
cool I just wanted to make sure again

1401
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:27,440
first time using the platform I already

1402
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,160
received the feedback so we are learning

1403
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,160
fast our

1404
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:38,960
friend okay well I think um if there if

1405
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,680

01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,559
