1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,040
chaos costs money most

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:10,840
organizations that I work with and have

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,400
worked with really struggle with

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,480
controlling the chaos within the context

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,840
of delivering usable working product to

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,199
their customers they find that the the

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,599
the the work is substandard we've got a

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
lot of a lot of bugs hitting production

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,599
we've perhaps got a lot of rework

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,599
happening cuz things aren't aren't quite

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,239
what we expect them to be or or don't

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,280
meet the minimum standard for our

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,640
organization and we end up going down

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,440
dead ends I'm going to need to explain

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,800
that

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,120
but a lot of the time and and and I do

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,360
this as well when I'm building products

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
is you try and figure out a solution to

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,359
the problem you've got right you've got

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,680
a problem you know where you want to get

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,960
to where you want to get to just now and

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,760
you come up with a solution that gets

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,840
you to that that that thing that you

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,520
want to get to but over over time that

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,240
where you want to get to does in fact

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,840
shift right it could shift because of

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,200
different Market opportunities that

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,119
arise or it could shift because we we

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,920
we're scaling right so we we came up

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,159
with a solution that was on par at the

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,360
time we we we we came up with a solution

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,159
but now it now it's subpar it doesn't

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,960
you know it's it's slow we're running

34
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,520
into problems we're we're having a lot

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,200
of support calls because of Technology

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,600
choices that we made that are no longer

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,240
no longer valid uh you see this a lot in

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,640
the in the extreme in the Airlines and

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,320
car rental companies right they have a

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,159
lot of I would call it technical debt um

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,040
the choices that were made at the time

42
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,960
that they've never gone back around and

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,880
refactored right so they still have

44
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,280
Mainframe systems and they don't have

45
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,520
people who understand the Mainframe

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,840
systems anymore so they've get double

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
problem

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,360
not only do they still have those

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
mainframes but nobody in the

50
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,479
organization knows how they work how to

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,200
reimplement them how to manage them

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,400
where where to kick them when something

53
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,280
goes wrong and that happens all the time

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
in technology right the technology moves

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
forward I I work with lots of

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,519
organizations who have solved problems

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,080
in ways that made perfect sense at the

58
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,959
time because there was no solution on

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,239
the Shelf out there that you could go

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,599
get I've got one customer that built

61
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,239
their own sof control system because

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,360
they started developing software 30

63
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,040
years ago and 30 years ago building

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,280
software at scale there weren't very

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,760
many options for Source Control Systems

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,319
the ones that were out there maybe

67
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,200
didn't fit their needs so they created

68
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,319
their own one but today that doesn't

69
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,840
make any sense whatsoever right there

70
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,040
are there are plenty of good source

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,760
Control Systems out there git is the

72
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,200
deao standard and they should be have

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,280
all of their code all of their systems

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,760
on G

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,280
but you need to invest time and money to

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,040
move from what you had before to what

77
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,480
you need now and that's part of this

78
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,840
story of of technical leadership and

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,720
Engineering

80
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,920
Excellence we need to be focused on

81
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,360
ensuring that our systems and processes

82
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
that our people are are using are as

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,159
effective as

84
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,519
possible so that their job is as slick

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,040
and easy as possible Right Satia does

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,080
good work on this at Microsoft right he

87
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,920
he would rather people spent the best

88
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Engineers the the most skilled people

89
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,760
spent time on optimizing the systems

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,480
that we have because then we can come

91
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,959
back around and build all the features

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,760
we want because we have these really

93
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:59,400
slick systems um and it seems like it's

94
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,239
a cost right but actually these systems

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,439
that's slickness of these systems that

96
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:08,079
Control the Chaos are a Value Center

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,280
because they are the thing that supports

98
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,000
our ability to deliver new features a

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,160
great example is the Azure devops team

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,720
they back in

101
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,199
2012 before they they they improved

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,120
their systems they were they were

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,400
delivering something like 24 25 features

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,120
to production each year with 650 people

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,039
with an application of technical

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,360
excellence and effort right this is not

107
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,880
for free and great technical leadership

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,639
within the organization they took that

109
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,680
from 25 features to production each year

110
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:50,360
to over 600 features to production each

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,440
year and that difference was because

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,720
they paid back a lot of the I I'm going

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,639
to say technical debt some of it was

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:02,240
technical debt other stuff was technical

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,160
cruft just buildup of I don't know

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,320
sediment buildup of of of rust in your

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,639
in your system because things get old

118
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,240
technology moves really fast and we need

119
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,759
to keep up with it and because they made

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,319
those changes just one simple thing they

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,360
they flipped from lots of long running

122
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,759
system tests to unit tests took them

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,400
four years of effort to get there but

124
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,880
they took their engineering team's

125
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:38,400
ability to see whether what they've done

126
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,759
works from 48 Hours down to 3 and a half

127
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
minutes think what that would do to your

128
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,520
productivity if you had to wait 48 hours

129
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,000
to find out if the simplest change had

130
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,960
been successful you'd push bigger and

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,080
bigger changes through the pipe so when

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,199
you do have a problem it's harder and

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,479
harder to figure out what that problem

134
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:58,440
is whereas if you're able to find out if

135
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,880
it works in 3 and A2 minutes you'll be

136
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,360
running that all the time on on the

137
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,800
smallest changes you make and you will

138
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,280
build a better product that's more

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
scalable and has less Band-Aids right

140
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,120
you're not out with the super glue and

141
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,960
sticky tape trying to seal over the the

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,759
the the gaps for bad choices that you

143
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,199
made because you didn't know that there

144
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,639
was a problem you didn't know it wasn't

145
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,280
going to meet the

146
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,919
standard so that cost of chaos is

147
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,840
because of poor technical leadership and

148
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,759
low engineering Excellence you might C

149
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
engineering mediocrity within an

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,000
organization you can solve these

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,199
problems by having your best Engineers

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,800
your best people focus on delivering the

153
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,479
systems the optimizations to the systems

154
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,840
that you need so everybody on every team

155
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,080
has the easiest possible job adding

156
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,080
value in your product
