 Chaos Costs Money: How Engineering Excellence Controls Chaos and Boosts Productivity | Martin Hinshelwood

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, weâ€™ll explore how engineering mediocrity and technical debt contribute to chaos and waste in software deliveryâ€”and how investing in technical leadership and engineering excellence can transform your organization.

Learn how the Azure DevOps team achieved an incredible 24x increase in feature delivery by controlling chaos, refactoring systems, and focusing on technical excellence.

ðŸ“Œ Chapters:

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: The Cost of Chaos in Software Development
2. 01:45 â€“ Examples of Suboptimal Systems in Organizations
3. 04:00 â€“ Technical Debt vs. Technical Rust: Why Systems Degrade Over Time
4. 06:15 â€“ The Role of Technical Leadership in Reducing Chaos
5. 08:30 â€“ How Azure DevOps Improved Feature Delivery by 24x
6. 12:00 â€“ The Value of Fast Feedback Loops: From 48 Hours to 3 Minutes
7. 14:45 â€“ Engineering Excellence as a Value Center

ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:

â€¢ CTOs, engineering managers, and business leaders struggling with inefficiency and chaos in product delivery
â€¢ Product and development teams interested in optimizing their systems
â€¢ Organizations weighed down by technical debt or outdated processes
â€¢ Agile and DevOps practitioners focused on increasing value delivery

ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:

â€¢ Why technical debt and outdated systems lead to chaos
â€¢ The importance of investing in systems and tools to reduce inefficiency
â€¢ How fast feedback loops can transform team productivity
â€¢ Real-world examples, including how the Azure DevOps team improved productivity
â€¢ How technical leadership drives engineering excellence

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

â€¢ Chaos in software delivery stems from outdated systems, poor leadership, and lack of investment in engineering excellence.
â€¢ The Azure DevOps team reduced feedback time from 48 hours to 3 minutes, enabling smaller, faster, and more reliable changes.
