 ✅ Done Means In Production — Not Just Code Complete
🎥 Episode 1 of 10 — Just Dropped

“If it’s not in the hands of users… it’s not done.”
📦 Writing code? Not done.
🧪 Testing it? Still not done.
📊 Demoing it in a sprint review? You guessed it—not done.
✅ Done means live.
✅ Done means delivering real outcomes.
✅ Done means gathering telemetry from actual users.
But too many teams are still celebrating fake finishes—and it’s costing them time, trust, and value.

💡 At NKD Agility, we help teams move beyond task-complete and focus on outcome-complete.

🎯 In this 2-minute video:
→ We redefine “done” through the lens of real value delivery
→ Show why unshipped work = zero learning
→ Call out the difference between “code complete” and “customer usable”
Because customers don’t care what you finished.
They care what they can use right now.

👇 Watch now. Follow the full 10-part series and let’s redefine what “done” really means. Visit https://www.nkdagility.com if you want help creating a powerful definition of done for your #productdevelopment teams.
