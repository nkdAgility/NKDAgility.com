If it's not in the hands of users, it's not done. Writing code isn't done. Testing code isn't done. Demoing something in a meeting isn't done. Done means that the increment is live in production, gathering telemetry, delivering real evidence against real goals.

We help teams shift away from celebrating fake finishes towards shipping actual usable outcomes, because work that isn't live isn't learning. And if it isn't learning, it isn't delivering value.

Your customers don't care about completed tasks. They care about what's available to them right now. If your teams confuse code complete with done, let's talk about shifting to real value delivery.
