increment is live in

At Naked Agility we help teams shift

towards shipping actual usable outcomes

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,760
because work that isn't live isn't

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,879

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,520
isn't delivering value Your customers

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,600
don't care about completed tasks They

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,960
care about what's available to them
