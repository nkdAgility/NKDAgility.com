Without shared standards, quality is a coin toss. I’ve seen it time and again: when every team defines “done” in their own way, you don’t get value—you get uncertainty and risk. Different interpretations of what “done” means don’t just create confusion; they breed chaos, introduce production risks, and leave you with invisible liabilities lurking in your product. In short, you can’t trust the increment.

Let’s be honest—if you can’t trust the increment, you can’t trust your process. And if you can’t trust your process, how can you possibly deliver value with any degree of predictability? This is not just a theoretical problem. I’ve worked with organisations where one team’s “done” meant “it compiles,” while another’s meant “it’s in production and monitored.” The result? A patchwork of half-finished work, missed expectations, and a backlog of technical debt that nobody wants to own.

Why Shared Standards Matter

- **Consistency**: When every team works to the same definition of done, you eliminate ambiguity. Everyone knows what’s expected, and there’s no room for shortcuts or misunderstandings.
- **Predictability**: Predictable delivery doesn’t come from wishful thinking or heroic efforts. It comes from a shared standard that everyone honours, sprint after sprint.
- **Quality**: A clear, organisation-wide definition of done ensures that every increment is truly usable and validated—not just “done” in name only.
- **Trust**: Stakeholders can trust what’s delivered, and teams can trust each other. That trust is the foundation of agility.

The Cost of Fragmentation

When teams are left to their own devices, defining “done” however they see fit, you end up with:

- **Invisible liabilities**: Work that looks finished but isn’t truly usable or supportable.
- **Production risks**: Features that pass internal checks but fail in the real world.
- **Uncertainty**: Nobody knows what to expect from the next increment, making planning and forecasting a guessing game.

I’ve seen organisations try to paper over these cracks with more process, more documentation, or more meetings. But none of that addresses the root cause: a lack of shared standards.

How We Help

This is where we come in. We help organisations define and align on a single, clear definition of done—a standard that every team understands and upholds. This isn’t about bureaucracy or slowing teams down. It’s about creating a foundation for real agility:

- **Workshops to build consensus**: We bring teams together to surface assumptions and agree on what “done” really means.
- **Practical, actionable standards**: No vague checklists—just clear, testable criteria that fit your context.
- **Ongoing support**: We help you embed these standards into your daily work, so they become second nature.

My Advice

If you want consistency and predictability across teams, don’t leave your definition of done to chance. Align on a shared standard. Make it visible. Make it non-negotiable. Because predictability doesn’t come from a fragmented process; it comes from a shared commitment to quality.

Let’s stop tossing the coin on quality. Let’s align your definition of done—so every increment is something you can trust.
