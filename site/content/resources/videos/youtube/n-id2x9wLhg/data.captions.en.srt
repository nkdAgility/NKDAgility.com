1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,799
without shared standards quality is a

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,280
coin toss when every team defines done

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,360
differently you don't get value you get

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,280
uncertainty and risk different

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,240
interpretations mean chaos production

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,680
risks and invisible liabilities it means

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,720
you can't trust the increment at Naked

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,199
Agility we help organizations define and

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,920
align on a single clear definition of

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,399
done a standard that every team

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,800
understands a standard that ensures

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,960
every increment is truly usable and

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,200
validated because predictability doesn't

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,879
come from a fragmented process it comes

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,239
from a shared standard that everybody

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,120
honors when consistency and

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,559
predictability across teams let's align

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
your definition of done
