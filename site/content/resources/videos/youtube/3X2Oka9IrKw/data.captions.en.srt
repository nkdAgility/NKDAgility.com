1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,400
more teams should mean more Innovation

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,279
right not more layers of process not

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,960
endless meetings not bottlenecks at

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,240
every turn but scaling often feels like

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,000
that you add teams and suddenly

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,400
everything slows down decisions take

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,519
longer processes get heavier and before

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,240
you know it you're buried in

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,439
bureaucracy so why does this happen well

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,640
when organizations scale they tend to

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,079
fall back on what feels safe rges

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,559
structure formal process and topown

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,960
control But the irony is all that

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,399
structure kills the very thing they're

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,039
trying to achieve Innovation speed and

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,239
value at naked agility we take a

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,879
different approach scaling shouldn't

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,160
mean slowing down it should amplify your

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,480
ability to deliver value not suffocate

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,920
it and that's exactly what we help teams

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,320
do we focus on building adaptability

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,559
into the core of your organization so no

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,960
matter how much you grow you stay

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,640
responsive Nimble and

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,000
Innovative because at the end of the day

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,560
scaling isn't about adding more layers

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,680
it's about unlocking more potential and

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,680
that's what we're here to do
