1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,040
the current state of um scrum Masters in

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,840
the industry at the moment is pretty

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:14,080
pretty terrible um there is a massive

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,400
massive systemic lack of

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,760
competence um in the in in the scrum

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,560
Master role in the scrum Master

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,880
accountability across organizations and

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,480
I think much of this comes from

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,840
the Boom that we've had the cash cow

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,440
that we've had in the agile world where

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,640
um the the this the demand for scrum

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:46,360
Masters to help teams which really

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,280
wasn't I guess realized as much before

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,160
the early naughties um has far

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,039
outstripped Supply right so so we want

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,000
to have somebody with some kind of uh

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,039
competence within this context on every

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,159
team um in every group um in every

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,600
Department of every every company right

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,960
so whether you're called a scrum master

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,000
or an agile coach or whatever um it's

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:18,119
all the same the same skill set and

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,119
because there's been a massive uh um

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,200
demand but very small Supply the price

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,119
has gone up and because the price has

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,040
gone up all the the the folks who aren't

27
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,439
even in it aren't even in that world of

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
the context of that team are looking at

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,360
these very lucrative jobs over here in

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,479
this other space and the grass is

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,840
greener over there so let's let's go

32
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,600
over there and we have lots and lots and

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,560
lots and lots of people over the last 15

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,280
years 15 almost 20 years um that have

35
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,399
moved in to this space to be a scrum

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,119
master or agile coach um who largely

37
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,719
have no skills whatsoever within the

38
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,640
context of the team uh maybe they've

39
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:12,400
done a a two-day scrum Master Class um

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,040
which FYI does not make you a scrum

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,239
master um just

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,920
like I don't know passing your driving

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,760
test doesn't make you a Formula 1 driver

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,239
right it just means that you you're

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,400
hopefully not a danger to everybody on

46
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,239
the road hopefully doesn't mean that

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,519
that that's not true um and you've got a

48
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,920
lifelong learning and experience right

49
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,159
you can't just jump in a Formula One car

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,440
you can't just jump in any racing car on

51
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,360
any track for uh uh without some level

52
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,200
of skills training knowledge expertise

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,040
you can get a track day right but um um

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,360
expect there to be limitations on what

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,480
it is you can do be be because it it's

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,080
takes experience and time to build that

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,840
experience and

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,280
understanding

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,239
of the

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:15,360
detail of the world within which you're

61
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,920
coaching and helping teams right um so

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,000
if I was coaching and I I for example

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:27,000
here's a great example of um a lack of

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,120
competence I did a bunch of training not

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,280
coaching but training um for police

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,480
officers in Ghana um they were going to

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,760
be using um scrum as an organizational

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,480
change mechanism like not to do their

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,040
work we were teaching them scrum so that

70
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,840
they could use scrum to change the as a

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,760
change mechanism in their

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
organization so I I have I have

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,760
competence and can understand

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,040
organizations and organizational

75
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,319
structure through experience right and

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
understand

77
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,400
how I understand

78
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,159
scrum and how you can use scrum to

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,159
incrementally and iteratively change

80
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,760
your organization and deal with those uh

81
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,560
that complexity right you have a backlog

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,160
backlog of organizational changes and

83
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,840
what Cadence are you iterating on them

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,479
all those kind of things

85
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:28,680
and but I have absolutely zero

86
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,520
understanding of police work beyond what

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,639
I see on TV

88
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:37,000
right I have I have no experience or

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,400
skills I can't say to a police

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,160
officer this is how you should do your

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,600
job and it will make you more

92
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,600
effective I can't do that and I wouldn't

93
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,400
do that I would not do that um we had

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,639
some when I was teaching the the

95
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,720
training I had the the head of

96
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:58,360
Cid in in in one of the classes we did a

97
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,440
bunch of classes ah head of CID and CID

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,320
is if you're in the US it would be the

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,400
chief of detectives maybe I don't know

100
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,440
the head of detectives Lieutenant for

101
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:15,759
detectives uh Cid in the UK and the

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,880
British Empire world is the the the the

103
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,560
investigative Divi Division I don't even

104
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,280
know what it stands for ID I don't know

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,199
anyway um so he was the head of c and he

106
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,800
started asking me a bunch of questions

107
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,600
about how he could apply

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
the things we were talking about to

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,400
police

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,840
work and I had to say look I have no

111
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,039
knowledge or understanding of what it is

112
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,479
you do beyond the

113
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,440
movies and I can

114
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,199
imagine that you don't know how long

115
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
it's going to take to solve a case right

116
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,800
you have to do a bunch of work you know

117
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
there are some things you always have to

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,680
do and there'll be something different

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,080
in every case every everything that you

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,880
do but you know perhaps what the

121
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,440
definition of done what the list of

122
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,479
things at the end is that you need to

123
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,080
have um and it's it's great if you can

124
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
figure out how to leverage some of these

125
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
practices to be able to help with that

126
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,759
but I can't help you with that right

127
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,919
because that's not my background and

128
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,160
expertise but what we're seeing and have

129
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,360
seen over the last 15 20 years is loads

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,039
of people coming into um it right my

131
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,840
back ground is it that's where uh this

132
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,759
this this this this stuff kind of

133
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,680
spawned from most recently right the ad

134
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,639
your Manifesto for for software

135
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,360
development and um they they they have

136
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:50,120
no background in software no background

137
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,919
in uh um any sort of it and they've

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,479
perhaps done a two-day scrum Master

139
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,280
course or perhaps done a coaching class

140
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,599
right so they've learned to coach uh

141
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,680
professional coaching

142
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:09,520
experience and that's just not good

143
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,960
enough to be able to fulfill the

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,000
accountability of the scrum Master right

145
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,639
the scrum master has um an

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,440
accountability to help the team be as

147
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,400
effective as possible and they do that

148
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,000
through three areas right they have

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,440
three um kind of sets of

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
accountabilities as it were one is the

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,479
accountability to the team itself so

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,960
what can they do to help the team be

153
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:42,520
effective in order to help a team be

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,639
effective you need to

155
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,240
understand the

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,039
context within which the team are

157
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,080
working whatever that context is for me

158
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:55,039
it's software engineering right if

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,400
you're going to be helping a team of

160
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,960
software Engineers become more effective

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,560
you have to understand

162
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,599
the the the practices the principles of

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,599
that work so that you can help them so

164
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,840
in in the software engineering World um

165
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:16,280
there are we have we have modern

166
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,560
engineering practices we have devops um

167
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,560
um we have things like release planning

168
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,720
and scaling and uh all of those those

169
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,440
those things to do with to do with the

170
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,720
actual engineering practices but you

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,519
also have stuff you might gain through

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,159
experience in other areas like how to do

173
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,479
organizational change right that's not

174
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,000
something that maybe you need it

175
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,640
specific skills for or conflict

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,959
management right that's something that

177
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,959
you might learn in your professional

178
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,440
coaching um but that doesn't remove the

179
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,279
need to have that understanding of what

180
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,800
the team is working on what it is

181
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:03,760
they're doing um so for a scrum Master

182
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,800
within that context i w within the

183
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,959
context of a software team right there

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,880
would be other things on my list if it

185
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,440
was for for for a different type of work

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,680
but for a software team I I would expect

187
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,200
them to understand devops devops

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,200
principles devops practices um

189
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,680
understand what it takes to fulfill them

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,959
what it looks like when they're being

191
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,920
successful um to understand um modern

192
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,120
engineering practices

193
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,519
right what if if the team's work is

194
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,600
building

195
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,360
software you need to understand how to

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
build software in order to help the team

197
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,680
be effective at building software

198
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,200
because they might not know I've worked

199
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,800
with lots of lots of teams all over the

200
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,680
world as a as a devops consultant as an

201
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,480
agile

202
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,000
consultant

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,800
that have huge gaps in their

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,760
understanding of of huge huge massive

205
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,000
gaps in what it is they do the the one

206
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,720
of one of the biggest ones um that I

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,120
usually use as as an example right

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,720
biggest Gap um was using using Source

209
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,160
control and not and understanding

210
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,959
branching but not understanding merging

211
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,680
not understanding that there are tools

212
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,600
within your Source control system that

213
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,920
allow you to merge code in a mostly

214
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,560
automated fashion right if there's no

215
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,800
conflict in changes and then dealing

216
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,920
with conflicts and I worked with a team

217
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,120
it was 30 Engineers um in an

218
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,040
organization they've been building

219
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
software for for many years um those

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,839
lead Engineers there was people

221
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,160
who been building software for many many

222
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,519
years and they had no idea that there

223
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,399
were tools inside of the source control

224
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,760
system that allowed you to merge code

225
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,560
and they were doing it manually with

226
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Beyond Compare right they were just

227
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,000
comparing files and copying across the

228
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,680
bits that they want wanted hugely error

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,560
prone huge number of bugs introduced by

230
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,240
that kind of kind of mechanism because

231
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,680
they they weren't using those

232
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,200
tools if I didn't know that those tools

233
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,320
existed if I didn't understand the

234
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,040
workflow of source control right

235
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,360
regardless of whether you've actually

236
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,480
used Source control or not although I

237
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
think if you're going to be working with

238
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
software teams you have to understand

239
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,600
how Source control works you have to

240
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,480
understand how automated builds work you

241
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,920
have to understand how uh um um work

242
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,920
items um the work that you're doing can

243
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,079
be linked to the code so that you can

244
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,639
get more effective understanding of

245
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,040
what's being changed and how it's being

246
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,800
changed and how you're testing it um and

247
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
that doesn't require you to have been a

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,120
software engineer right if you've been a

249
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,040
tester or you've been an analyst on a

250
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,959
team and you've done those things for

251
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
many years you're going to understand

252
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,000
those things and if you don't understand

253
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,040
those things you need to learn those

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,360
things right in order to be a an

255
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,040
effective scrum Master for a software

256
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,360
engineering team but that's just one of

257
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,959
the things that one of the three things

258
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,519
that a a scrum Master is accountable for

259
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:19,160
they're also accountable for services to

260
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,680
the product owner not just to the team

261
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,680
but specifically to the product owner so

262
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,160
what does the product owner do the

263
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,839
product owner maximizes the value

264
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,000
delivered by the work from the

265
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,920
team so the one of the scrum Masters

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,160
jobs roles accountabilities things they

267
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,160
have to do is they have to be able to

268
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,160
enable and help that product owner

269
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,000
become more effective because that

270
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,000
product owner might not understand the

271
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,880
the things that they have to do they

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,199
might not understand the the processes

273
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,519
and practices that are available to them

274
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,000
they might have outdated knowledge they

275
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,000
might come from a

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,399
traditional uh um background where we're

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,560
not doing fast iterations and while most

278
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,959
of the practices can still be used they

279
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,639
need to be modified to allow it to work

280
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,680
in the iterative and incremental um

281
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,519
world right of continuous delivery and

282
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,199
continuous uh learning so how do you

283
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,000
help them if you don't understand what

284
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:27,240
they

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,320
do how how how how do you know that they

286
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,000
don't understand um hypothesis driven

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,279
engineering practices if if if you don't

288
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,079
understand hypothesis driven engineering

289
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:40,320
practices how do

290
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:43,399
you know that they should be able to

291
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,959
look at the Telemetry from the product

292
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:50,399
and understand and use it to help inform

293
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:53,399
the decisions that they're making how

294
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,120
how do you know that they need to be

295
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,360
building relationships with people

296
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,759
inside of the business and how they

297
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,160
build relationship ship with people

298
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,320
inside of the business and how they

299
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,040
understand the dynamic of those

300
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
relationships unless you do you can't

301
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,880
help them do that you can't help them do

302
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,120
something that they don't know or don't

303
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,079
understand how to do already and in my

304
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,360
experience many at least in my

305
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,880
experience right because remember um my

306
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,079
caveat with everything is I get called

307
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:27,720
by people who need help so in

308
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,399
general product owners don't have the

309
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,639
background knowledge understanding or

310
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:36,720
experience to know um how to maximize

311
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,199
the value delivered in the product right

312
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,079
there are absolutely product managers uh

313
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,279
and product owners out there who do

314
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,199
understand that absolutely um but they

315
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
don't need to call me to come and help

316
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,680
them right they don't come to my product

317
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,880
owner classes they don't come to my uh

318
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,800
uh uh product management Mentor programs

319
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,800
right because they already know that

320
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,759
stuff so they can do it but if you want

321
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,199
to help those people who don't

322
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,320
understand you need to understand that

323
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:06,240
thing to be able to to to help teach

324
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,079
them coach them and Mentor them right um

325
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,199
and we're not even done yet because

326
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,680
there's a there's a third thing and the

327
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:15,800
third thing is the

328
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,320
organizational um I guess uh uh Lisa

329
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Atkins calls it uh organizational

330
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,320
transformational Mastery I usually call

331
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
it organizational evolutionary Mastery

332
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,560
because I feel like Evolution doesn't

333
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,680
have an end whereas transformation might

334
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,399
have an end right it's a continuous

335
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,560
thing how how do you help the

336
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,240
organization change how do you um if you

337
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,199
don't understand organizational

338
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,079
topologies if you don't understand how

339
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,560
organizations function and go together

340
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,399
if you don't understand the the options

341
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,519
that are

342
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,079
available that have been known to be

343
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,759
effective within that space for things

344
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,759
to try and see whether it works within

345
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:02,199
this particular organization if you

346
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,720
don't have that standing how do you know

347
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:07,519
that something needs to change how do

348
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,319
you know that things can be different um

349
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,839
so you've got that

350
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:16,000
accountability to the organization for

351
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,680
helping them be effective and when you

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,360
bring all of that together you end up

353
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,839
with an individual that that's quite

354
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,880
significantly skilled with lots of

355
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,000
experience right they probably have a

356
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,040
Gray beard because they've been around

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,680
for a while um or gray hair right

358
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,839
they're they're they're

359
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:43,600
um he or she has been um in the trenches

360
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:46,480
with the team they've H worked as a team

361
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,720
member that's when I'm thinking about a

362
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,800
scrum master I'm thinking about somebody

363
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,319
who's worked as a team member for many

364
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,480
years gained a bunch of experience um

365
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,160
helped their team so they've started

366
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,360
helping their team their team has ret

367
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:06,319
ized that they're helping I they look to

368
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,959
them as a leader in that space of

369
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,079
Effectiveness um and then that grows

370
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,199
over time right so so not just the team

371
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,039
looking to them the product owner looks

372
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,520
at them the other people in the

373
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:24,400
organization start looking to them as

374
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,520
somebody who can help them uh um be more

375
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,160
effective deliver more value um change

376
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,720
the way we do things because have this

377
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,000
understanding of how all of the they

378
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,400
have they have a core understanding of

379
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,240
the theory the the the philosophies and

380
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,840
the principles to be able to apply them

381
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:48,480
within multiple various contexts but you

382
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,360
you get that through um learning you get

383
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,840
that through um experience not just

384
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,440
experience of doing it and trying it but

385
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,159
experience of of of of learning and

386
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,320
figuring it out and then seeing whether

387
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,159
it works and and closing those feedback

388
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
loops and having that Triple Loop

389
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,960
learning and changing your worldview and

390
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,280
how you can do things and this is just

391
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:15,559
not that it it doesn't seem to be that

392
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:17,720
common right um so there's a massive

393
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,080
deficit at the moment in the level of

394
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,520
competence and if you're you're you're

395
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,080
interested in in how big that deficit is

396
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,919
um there's

397
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,840
some a little is it anecdotal no it's

398
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,039
just not particular scientific but

399
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,280
there's some data from an organization

400
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:40,159
called scrum match uh who uh review

401
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,480
scrum Master skills I mean as part of

402
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,960
their story is is is is a little bit of

403
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
a recruitment story but they review

404
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,000
scrum Master skills um it's not just

405
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,320
people who are looking for jobs right

406
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,320
but it's it's it's to get a you get a

407
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,880
badge I I'm this level of scrum Master

408
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,240
uh so some people look at it as a bad

409
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:06,280
badging um and what they found was that

410
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:11,360
61% of the people that they engaged with

411
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,039
reviewed who were scrum Masters

412
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,760
already perhaps had been a scrum Master

413
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,039
for 10 years or more so there were

414
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,880
people in that list that were 10 years

415
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:26,720
or more um 61% of them are uh shouldn't

416
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:29,400
be SC masters 61% of them I think it was

417
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,840
38 I'm going to be a little bit off in

418
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,720
the percentages but only by fractions um

419
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,280
it was about 30 38% I think um had never

420
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
read the scrum guide and in that has

421
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,520
never read the scrum guide there were

422
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
scrum Masters who had been inrolled for

423
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,760
10 years or more never read the scrum

424
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,559
guide um there were uh uh uh the rest of

425
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,880
that

426
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,520
61% where I've read the scrum guide but

427
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,760
I kind of I you know I don't really

428
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,400
understand scrum that well I understand

429
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,840
scrum and I I can rudiment apply it to

430
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,840
to to

431
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,760
organizations none of those things are

432
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,000
good enough to be a scrum Master none of

433
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,520
those things are good enough to help a

434
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,679
product team be more effective so it's

435
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,039
absolutely no

436
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,840
surprise that as we enter a period of

437
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:23,120
fiscal uncertainty a global fiscal

438
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:29,000
uncertainty that

439
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:32,039
organizations are looking to reduce

440
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,640
their costs and they're looking at the

441
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,880
capability of the people that they

442
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,159
currently have as scrum Masters and

443
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,360
they're saying this isn't good enough

444
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,480
these people are not

445
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,919
competent and if you're not competent

446
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,360
you're incompetent the majority of scrum

447
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:53,919
Masters in row

448
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,159
today are incompetent they should not be

449
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:01,559
in that position they should not be

450
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:06,320
doing that wrong and the only only way

451
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:10,840
um organizations have to demonstrate

452
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,799
their lack of satisfaction with that is

453
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,400
to start getting rid of scrub Masters

454
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
and agile coaches and that's the

455
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,200
position we're in right now we're seeing

456
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,120
a a massive industry correction uh a

457
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,679
competence bubble has popped or an

458
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,559
incompetence bubble has popped um and

459
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,960
there are loads of good scrum Masters

460
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,919
that have been caught up in in in the

461
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,120
nasty right as organizations are

462
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,240
divesting themselves but almost all of

463
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,320
these organizations are still hiring

464
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,159
scrum Masters they're just being more

465
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,880
Discerning and I think we're moving from

466
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:54,679
an era of wild west agile towards more

467
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,679
of an era of competent agile
