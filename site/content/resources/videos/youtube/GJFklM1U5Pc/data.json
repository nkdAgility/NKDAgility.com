The massive demand for Scrum Masters has led to a systemic lack of competence across organizations. Many people have entered this field without the necessary skills, often with just a two-day course under their belt. But being a Scrum Master is about much more than that. It requires deep understanding, experience, and continuous learning.\n\nI share my experiences training police officers in Ghana, working with software teams, and consulting around the world, explaining why so many Scrum Masters are falling short. Without a solid understanding of the context within which theyâ€™re workingâ€”whether itâ€™s software engineering, product ownership, or organizational changeâ€”Scrum Masters canâ€™t truly help their teams. \n\nAs the industry faces economic uncertainty, organizations are starting to realize that many Scrum Masters donâ€™t have the competence they need. We are seeing a massive correction in the industry, as companies let go of underqualified Scrum Masters and look for more experienced professionals.
