title: 'The Competence Crisis in Scrum Master Roles: A Call for Excellence'
short_title: Scrum Master Competence Crisis Explained
description: Many Scrum Masters lack essential skills and experience, leading to poor agile outcomes. True competence requires deep knowledge, practical experience, and ongoing learning.
tldr: There is a widespread lack of competence among Scrum Masters due to high demand, low entry barriers, and insufficient experience, which undermines team and organizational effectiveness. Effective Scrum Masters need deep practical experience, a solid understanding of software development and DevOps, and the ability to support both teams and Product Owners while driving organizational change. Development managers should prioritize hiring or developing Scrum Masters with real-world experience and a commitment to continuous learning, rather than relying on certifications alone.

The current state of [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master roles is, to put it mildly, troubling. Across organizations, there’s a significant, systemic lack of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}) in the [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) accountability. This shortfall has grown from the agile boom of the past two decades, creating a demand for Scrum Masters that far outstrips the available supply. As a result, many individuals have transitioned into these roles without the necessary skills or experience to succeed.

* * *

## **The Demand for Scrum Masters Far Outstrips Supply**

The explosion of agile practices in the early 2000s led to a rapid increase in demand for Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches. This demand came from companies of all sizes, looking to incorporate [agile frameworks]({{< ref "/tags/agile-frameworks" >}}) into their teams and departments. But the supply of truly competent Scrum Masters couldn’t keep pace:

- 📈 **High demand, low supply:** Every organization wanted a Scrum Master, but finding skilled individuals was difficult.

- 💼 **Lucrative opportunities:** The gap between supply and demand drove up salaries, attracting many people to the role without the required background.

- 🚪 **Entry of unqualified individuals:** With the promise of high-paying jobs, many shifted into the Scrum space without relevant experience, sometimes armed only with a two-day course.

* * *

## **Why a Two-Day Course Doesn’t Make You a Scrum Master**

Let’s be clear: a two-day Scrum Master course does not make you a qualified Scrum Master. It’s akin to passing your driving test; it means you have a basic understanding, but it doesn’t make you a Formula 1 driver. Mastery takes time, experience, and [continuous learning]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-learning" >}}):

- 🏎️ **Experience matters:** Just like racing, you can't jump into the complexities of Scrum and expect to excel without experience.

- 📚 **Lifelong learning:** Becoming effective in this role requires a deep understanding of the team’s context and the challenges they face.

- 🔄 **Contextual understanding:** The ability to coach teams requires more than theoretical knowledge; it demands practical experience.

* * *

## **The Influx of Unqualified Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches**

Over the past 15-20 years, the agile industry has seen many people move into Scrum Master roles with limited competence. They might have completed a short course or attended a [coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}) class, but these don’t equip them with the necessary skills:

- 🧑‍💻 **Lack of IT and software experience:** Many individuals come from non-IT backgrounds and lack the understanding of the technical environment they are supposed to support.

- 🚫 **Limited coaching skills:** While they may know some coaching techniques, this does not translate into the ability to guide teams through complex challenges.

- 🧠 **Gap in organizational understanding:** Effective Scrum Masters need to grasp how organizations work, how to foster change, and how to support teams and Product Owners alike.

* * *

## **Training Police Officers in Ghana: A Lesson in Context and Competence**

I had the opportunity to train police officers in Ghana, using Scrum as an organizational change mechanism. Here’s what I learned:

- 👮 **Teaching without domain expertise:** While I understood Scrum and organizational change, I had no expertise in police work.

- 🎬 **Admitting my limits:** When a senior officer asked how to apply Scrum principles directly to police work, I had to be honest—I lacked the depth of knowledge in their specific field.

- 🔍 **Focus on context:** This experience underscored that without understanding the context of a team’s work, a Scrum Master can’t effectively guide them. Knowing the framework isn't enough; one must know the environment in which it's being applied.

* * *

## **Why Competence in Software Engineering is Crucial for Scrum Masters**

For a Scrum Master working with software engineering teams, having a foundational understanding of [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) is critical:

- 🤖 **Understanding [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) principles:** It’s vital to grasp modern [engineering practices]({{< ref "/tags/engineering-practices" >}}) and DevOps methodologies, as they directly impact how teams work.

- 🛠️ **Knowing the tools:** A Scrum Master should be familiar with tools like source control, automated builds, and work item tracking.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Helping teams fill knowledge gaps:** For example, I’ve worked with teams that didn’t know how to use source control systems for merging code. This lack of knowledge created inefficiencies and introduced bugs. My technical understanding allowed me to guide them to more effective practices.

* * *

## **The Role of the Scrum Master in Supporting Product Owners**

A Scrum Master isn’t just accountable to the team; they also have a critical role in supporting the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}):

- 🎯 **Maximizing [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}):** The Product Owner’s primary job is to maximize the value delivered by the team. A competent Scrum Master helps them do this effectively.

- 🧠 **Understanding modern product practices:** This includes hypothesis-driven development, telemetry analysis, and fostering stakeholder relationships.

- 🔄 **Bridging the gap:** Many Product Owners come from traditional backgrounds, lacking familiarity with agile practices. The Scrum Master must bridge this gap, guiding them through the nuances of iterative development and [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}).

* * *

## **Organizational Change: The Third Key Responsibility of Scrum Masters**

The role of a Scrum Master extends beyond the team and the Product Owner. They also play a vital part in driving organizational change:

- 🌱 **Continuous evolution:** It’s not just about transforming an organization—it’s about evolving it. This requires a deep understanding of organizational topologies and dynamics.

- 🔄 **Adapting practices:** A Scrum Master must be able to identify effective strategies that suit the unique needs of their organization.

- 🚀 **Championing change:** They help organizations experiment with new approaches, refine them through feedback loops, and adapt as necessary.

* * *

## **The Skills and Experience Required for Effective Scrum Masters**

An effective Scrum Master is more than a facilitator—they are a leader, a coach, and a mentor. This level of competence requires years of experience:

- 👴 **A seasoned professional:** The ideal Scrum Master has been in the trenches with the team, accumulating hands-on experience.

- 💡 **Triple-loop learning:** They constantly refine their understanding, adapting their approach to fit new challenges and contexts.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Building relationships:** Over time, a skilled Scrum Master earns the trust of the team, the Product Owner, and the organization as a whole.

* * *

## **A Massive Deficit in Scrum Master Competence**

Today, there’s a significant competence deficit in the Scrum Master role, and the data backs this up. For instance, an organization called Scrum Match, which evaluates Scrum Master skills, revealed some concerning statistics:

- 📊 **61% of Scrum Masters shouldn't be in the role:** Many of these individuals have been in the position for over a decade without fully understanding the fundamentals.

- 📖 **38% have never read the Scrum Guide:** Shockingly, even some long-tenured Scrum Masters have never read this foundational document.

- 🔍 **Limited understanding:** Others have read it but lack a deep comprehension of its principles, leading to ineffective implementation.

* * *

## **Navigating the Industry Correction: Moving Toward Competent Agile**

As we face global economic uncertainties, companies are becoming more discerning about their agile practices:

- 🚫 **Incompetent Scrum Masters are being let go:** Organizations are cutting costs by releasing unqualified Scrum Masters.

- 🔍 **A shift towards competence:** Despite the layoffs, many companies continue to hire—but with a focus on finding truly capable individuals.

- 🌟 **Opportunities for improvement:** For those in the role today, this is a chance to deepen their skills, embrace continuous learning, and strive for mastery.

* * *

## **Conclusion: Elevating the Standards of Scrum Mastery**

The competence crisis in Scrum Master roles is a reality, but it’s not without solutions. The industry is moving from the wild west of Agile toward an era where competence is king. To succeed as a Scrum Master, you must embrace the journey of continuous learning, develop a deep understanding of the context you’re working in, and commit to becoming a true servant leader.

👉 **Key Takeaways:**

- Invest in your growth beyond certifications.

- Build a solid understanding of your team’s domain.

- Focus on practical experience and real-world application.

By focusing on these areas, Scrum Masters can elevate their roles, deliver more value, and help their organizations thrive in this new age of agile.
