# In your experience, what is the current state of Scrum Master competence in the product development

ðŸ’¡ The Competence Crisis in Scrum Masters: Why the Industry is Facing a Reckoning ðŸ’¥

In this video, I take a deep dive into the current state of Scrum Masters in the industryâ€”and it's not looking good. The massive demand for Scrum Masters has led to a systemic lack of competence across organizations. Many people have entered this field without the necessary skills, often with just a two-day course under their belt. But being a Scrum Master is about much more than that. It requires deep understanding, experience, and continuous learning.

I share my experiences training police officers in Ghana, working with software teams, and consulting around the world, explaining why so many Scrum Masters are falling short. Without a solid understanding of the context within which theyâ€™re workingâ€”whether itâ€™s software engineering, product ownership, or organizational changeâ€”Scrum Masters canâ€™t truly help their teams. 

As the industry faces economic uncertainty, organizations are starting to realize that many Scrum Masters donâ€™t have the competence they need. We are seeing a massive correction in the industry, as companies let go of underqualified Scrum Masters and look for more experienced professionals. Watch to learn more about how we got here and whatâ€™s needed to fix this competence crisis. ðŸš€
