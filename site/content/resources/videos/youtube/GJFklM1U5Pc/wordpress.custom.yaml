  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The current state of Scrum Master roles is, to put it mildly, troubling. Across organizations, there’s a significant, systemic lack of competence in the Scrum Master accountability. This shortfall has grown from the agile boom of the past two decades, creating a demand for Scrum Masters that far outstrips the available supply. As a result, many individuals have transitioned into these roles without the necessary skills or experience to succeed.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-demand-for-scrum-masters-far-outstrips-supply\"><strong>The Demand for Scrum Masters Far Outstrips Supply</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The explosion of agile practices in the early 2000s led to a rapid increase in demand for Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches. This demand came from companies of all sizes, looking to incorporate agile frameworks into their teams and departments. But the supply of truly competent Scrum Masters couldn’t keep pace:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>📈 <strong>High demand, low supply:</strong> Every organization wanted a Scrum Master, but finding skilled individuals was difficult.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>💼 <strong>Lucrative opportunities:</strong> The gap between supply and demand drove up salaries, attracting many people to the role without the required background.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🚪 <strong>Entry of unqualified individuals:</strong> With the promise of high-paying jobs, many shifted into the Scrum space without relevant experience, sometimes armed only with a two-day course.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-a-two-day-course-doesn-t-make-you-a-scrum-master\"><strong>Why a Two-Day Course Doesn’t Make You a Scrum Master</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let’s be clear: a two-day Scrum Master course does not make you a qualified Scrum Master. It’s akin to passing your driving test; it means you have a basic understanding, but it doesn’t make you a Formula 1 driver.
