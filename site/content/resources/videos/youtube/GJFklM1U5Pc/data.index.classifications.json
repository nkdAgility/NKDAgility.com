It does not define, identify, or explicitly apply the irreducible, immutable first principles foundational to Lean, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps. Principles here are presented as aspirational and context-dependent (e.g., continuous learning, practical experience), which makes them ineligible for First Principal categorization. There are no direct or indirect mentions of first principles as immutable constraints, nor is there a discussion of what constitutes a first principle, its violation, or its role in systems design.

The discussion remains about human learning, experience, and competence. While it touches on teamwork and organizational change, there is no suggestion of AI involvement, AI partnership, or collective intelligence per the classification definition. The audience (agile professionals/Scrum practitioners) matches the category, but only in the narrow sense that the roles discussed could one day be augmented by AI—none is present here.
