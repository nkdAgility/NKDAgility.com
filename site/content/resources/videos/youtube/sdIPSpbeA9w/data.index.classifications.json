While the closing paragraph briefly references that automation leads to 'happier customers' and 'meets the needs of our customers,' the majority of the discussion centers on reducing human error, improving efficiency, and workflow quality rather than on measuring or optimizing for customer outcomes. There is little discussion on how customer value is defined, measured, or used as a guiding principle across delivery, which is essential for full alignment with the category. The audience is technical, overlapping with the intended audience, and the discussion is focused, but the lack of substantial evidence, practices, or philosophy linking automation adoption directly to customer-focused decision-making lowers the overall fit.",
