hello my name is Martin Thank You wit

5
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:22,660
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:26,930
scrum da dark and also Microsoft MVP in

7
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:30,350
your DevOps and I had I've been doing

8
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,560
some live videos over the past couple of

9
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,380
weeks I noticed that many people are and

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,030
I've been inspecting adapting on the

11
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,750
things that other folks are doing and I

12
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,630
think um this is going to become a

13
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,369
regular session I haven't settled on the

14
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,970
timing yet but I'd like to be able to

15
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:54,320
answer a bunch of questions that folks

16
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,570
ask there's been an interesting couple

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,290
of weeks and in that regard and I've had

18
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,770
a few people on Jim a few days ago and

19
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,860
Daniel Vacanti

20
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,110
last week to have a little chat um I've

21
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,260
since upgraded some of my technology

22
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,560
with Daniel we had some audio issues so

23
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,989
I now have a monitor in my ear and I got

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,470
a new new microphone so I think these

25
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:24,769
things will help a little bit the thing

26
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,650
that I wanted to UM chat a little bit

27
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:31,310
about today is I got our question from

28
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:37,610
somebody they asked on LinkedIn not

29
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:43,040
everybody wants to ask publicly so I've

30
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:46,549
added a link down here that you can go

31
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,440
to and ask me a question if you don't

32
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:55,880
want to ask it publicly you can always

33
00:02:48,440 --> 00:03:00,620
ask it publicly as well I think one of

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:05,930
my things are not working check you can

35
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:08,890
always ask it publicly and seems to be

36
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,890
online it's just pretending it's not

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,890
okay

38
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:25,250
yep I think I've got a problem with that

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:25,250
one let me just delete it and we had it

40
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:37,470
um not that one that's the one I want

41
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:40,459
one of my streaming services was not

42
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,310
connecting properly I think these things

43
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,379
happen they're sent to try us so as I

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,489
get set up with these things I'm going

45
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,739
to figure it out so that's me adding it

46
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,650
back in again

47
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:59,370
it says sending data but it hasn't

48
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:07,829
popped up and said it's online yet so we

49
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:14,090
will see I guess I'm going to have to go

50
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:17,699
figure that out afterwards never mind

51
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:21,030
so I'm going to be doing a few of these

52
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,560
I wanted to make sure that everybody was

53
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:27,320
able to ask questions even if they

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:32,160
didn't feel that they would be able to

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,570
see they didn't want to know some

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
everybody to know who they were that

57
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,580
kind of thing so I set that up that was

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,830
one of my colleagues who does some

59
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:46,050
officers suggested that and I think that

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,539
makes a lot of sense so the question

61
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,440
that that I got and that I thought was a

62
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:57,449
little bit interesting and was what are

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:01,650
folks going to do with their teams now

64
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:04,860
they're they're not effectively a

65
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,419
distributed team what are they going to

66
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,520
do with their boards how are they going

67
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:14,810
to manage that information so I want to

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,169
talk about em three different platforms

69
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,419
that I've used

70
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:23,430
they all have their pros and cons they

71
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,780
all have their specific areas of

72
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,060
interest and I think there's a little

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,670
bit of progression there I don't talk

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,760
about that but I also want to

75
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:37,240
speak a little bit about um what it says

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:41,639
in the scrum guide around co-located

77
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:45,100
teams it doesn't it doesn't really

78
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,360
mention co-located teams it says it's

79
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,800
better if people are able to work

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,860
together same as it does in the agile

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,860
manifesto and people work best if

82
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,020
they're in the same same location like

83
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,139
having a team room having our stuff on

84
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,220
the walls and having everybody together

85
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,080
but the realities of the current

86
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:07,540
situation mean that that's not always

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,940
going to be possible and while it does

88
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,330
mention those things in both the scrum

89
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:16,510
guide and I do manifesto it doesn't say

90
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:20,620
that they're mandated it's okay to have

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:23,800
a distributed team there's nothing wrong

92
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,500
with that you're going to maybe lose

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,570
some communication effectiveness but

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,070
that's the cost of doing it that way

95
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,500
that's just the way it is there's

96
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:37,330
nothing that says you can't do that so I

97
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,669
want to make you feel like or I want you

98
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,760
to have the expectation that you can

99
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:45,280
still be doing scrum you can still be

100
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,289
doing Kanban you can still be doing your

101
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,479
agile practices even when you're not in

102
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,840
the same room that's okay that's no

103
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,580
mandate for that the mandate for

104
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,810
colocation or not the mandate for

105
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,570
colocation the recommendation of

106
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,770
colocation and is really around

107
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,770
maximizing those communication channels

108
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,970
and we can do that maximization even

109
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:13,000
when we're not face to face so there are

110
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,990
tools we can use to store our backlogs

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
priorities and boards on the internet so

112
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,419
everybody can get access to them and in

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,010
a way that it's not just sitting in an

114
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,229
excel sheet that everybody's editing

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:30,910
because that does not do well for for

116
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:34,630
multiple and edits and so what I want to

117
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,289
do is show you these three tools that

118
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:41,070
I've looked at I've used all of these

119
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:43,050
tools in anger

120
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,490
they have their pros and cons some of

121
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:48,440
them are easier than others

122
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:56,700
the first that I wanted to show was

123
00:07:48,440 --> 00:08:01,110
github so if I go to github.com github

124
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,760
does have the ability to have issues I

125
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:08,580
have our project here in github

126
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,200
repository and github the onus is on the

127
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,980
repository and then everything else

128
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,720
hangs off that repository so I can go in

129
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:19,020
and I can I can do issues which are

130
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,390
pretty straightforward they're not great

131
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,450
for agile management it's just our list

132
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:28,500
of issues and but any of these issues

133
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:32,160
and can be added to a project

134
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,950
so here I've added this issue to a

135
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:37,950
particular project and it's been added

136
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,040
to the to-do column so I'll get to do in

137
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,099
progress and done and I can click the

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,690
little cog and I can add it to as many

139
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:48,720
different projects as I want and it will

140
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,450
basically create an item on that project

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,100
that is related to this item here

142
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,900
they're not I think under the covers

143
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,520
they're probably separate items but from

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,250
our perspective they're kind of the same

145
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,740
thing but it will show us some cross

146
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,130
data between them so if I go over into

147
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,410
projects and I can create as many sub

148
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,080
projects to this repository remember

149
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:14,630
repository is the main item and then

150
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,940
projects are inside of that and where

151
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,070
and I've not done a whole whole lot with

152
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,610
this but I can add additional columns

153
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:27,900
and I can edit the column I can edit the

154
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:30,000
name I can add things I can copy a link

155
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,410
directly to that column and I can drag

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,740
things around inside of that world so

157
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:42,600
there's an item that I added directly to

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:45,900
the board and here's that item that is

159
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:51,000
linked that is when I click it it's

160
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,980
going to open the data from the other

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,490
item rather

162
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:59,240
rather than having another thing going

163
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,000
on there this is a good tool if you are

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,130
running an open source project as many

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,900
are this is one of my open source

166
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:12,680
projects and it has its limitations the

167
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:16,730
all of the the data is stored in the US

168
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:22,870
if you are an enterprise company or any

169
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:27,170
European or non-us entity that has to

170
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:31,100
have private data then I would not

171
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,750
recommend storing it in github privately

172
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,150
at the moment if it's a public project

173
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,640
like it's our open source doesn't matter

174
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,950
I have all of my stuff in github as well

175
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,880
but it was a private project you might

176
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:46,450
want to and store it somewhere where you

177
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,130
can control the sovereignty of the data

178
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,440
and that's that's a big deal for many

179
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,780
European organizations but there is also

180
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,780
private repos if you're a US company and

181
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,400
github as well and you get some of those

182
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,470
features there so it's a pretty

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,080
straightforward tool lots people already

184
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,780
understand how to use github they like

185
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,530
the features of github and they can add

186
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:11,780
that capabilities there the second tool

187
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,610
that I went to look at is actually a

188
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:19,730
little bit of a step back from from

189
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:24,470
development and that's plat tasks office

190
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:28,610
comm and Microsoft planner is a small

191
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:32,260
tool built into the office 365 suite and

192
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:37,000
there is an app that works on your

193
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:39,170
mobile phone that allows you to create

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,270
boards and move items between those

195
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:48,890
boards so at the moment they just call

196
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:51,400
them buckets so if I do in progress done

197
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,620
to create the same idea as we had in

198
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:59,310
github and then I just add a task

199
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,920
I can add a task on there and then I can

200
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,990
drag it between the boards I can add

201
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
additional information if I want like

202
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,350
attachments and priorities and start

203
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,320
dates and end dates and all of those

204
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,089
kind of things and whether it's started

205
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,490
in progress or completed so regardless

206
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,420
of the the columns a little bit weird

207
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:21,570
maybe but I can also add a little tag so

208
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,610
I can make this one green I don't know

209
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,980
what that did did that do anything

210
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,000
do I have to click it or is that just

211
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:32,000
changing the label is a receive button

212
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,310
okay I don't know how that part of that

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,990
works but I'm sure you can figure it out

214
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:46,230
I saw a simple board it has really good

215
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:48,720
mobile access which github has good

216
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,130
mobile access just for issues and wiki's

217
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,570
and source code it doesn't have good

218
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,529
mobile access for the planner

219
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,180
they are projects yet that's okay I'm

220
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,970
sure I'm sure they'll get around to it

221
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,700
at some point but this can be a useful

222
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,630
tool and this can you can have tasks on

223
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,120
here that link into your outlook tasks

224
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,790
you can have stuff you just add to the

225
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,640
board you can create charts and

226
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,910
schedules and plan around this with

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:19,470
notes this is this is a good medium

228
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,930
solution especially if you're

229
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:26,970
interacting or doing non-engineering

230
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,400
work and you can add your your plan to

231
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,570
your calendar so you can see all of the

232
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,820
things you're supposed to be working on

233
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,370
and you can add as many people as you

234
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,140
want into the project you can see here

235
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,880
I've got a bunch of guests in there

236
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,470
there's only two people in my as your

237
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,480
active directory that are like members

238
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,839
of the item directory everybody else's

239
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,089
are is a guest this is part of my one of

240
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,250
my projects the other one that I want to

241
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,940
talk about is actually might want my

242
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:04,640
favorite one to use and and that's

243
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:07,500
Devdas your comm Azure DevOps is tool

244
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,059
that is not always free

245
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,599
so github

246
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:17,939
are free for public projects office

247
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:22,069
tasks the office comm Microsoft planner

248
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:27,569
is free for or free as the bad word is

249
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:30,059
included in your your office 365

250
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:37,129
subscription so we'll just I'll be there

251
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:37,129
which is okay but there is also the

252
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:53,279
tools in Azure DevOps to look at as well

253
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:55,639
so if I sign in to Azure DevOps it's

254
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,829
going to sign in to one of my

255
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:03,199
organizations so my nkd agility my

256
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:06,329
company's organization and here I have

257
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,989
all of my projects listed so in Azure

258
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,509
DevOps

259
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:12,419
project is at the top and then you can

260
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,999
create multiple you can have one or more

261
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:17,039
repos inside of your project so if you

262
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,649
just have a small product that you're

263
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,629
working on you can have project and repo

264
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:23,309
just being the same thing you one-to-one

265
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,729
relationship which is actually what I've

266
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:31,319
got here or you can create multiple

267
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:33,779
repos inside of our project and by

268
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,779
adding repos to that that like we just

269
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,749
like you add projects to get up so if I

270
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:44,849
go into my azure DevOps

271
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:47,819
process tools you can see that I have

272
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:49,919
some wiki it's very a little bit like

273
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,809
github in that regard it doesn't have

274
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,419
all the same features there's a little

275
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:59,309
bit of disparity between them but I have

276
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:00,959
at boards and on boards I have straight

277
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:02,879
work items this is the work item

278
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,399
tracking systems this is just a list of

279
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,919
the work items so I can see my active

280
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,949
work items I can see work items I follow

281
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,929
I've recently updated and I can add new

282
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:16,079
work items of various types so it's not

283
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:18,959
just issues or just tasks like in the

284
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,199
other two tools that I showed you have

285
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,860
various different things I'm using a

286
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,570
process

287
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,480
here called the scrum process so I have

288
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,460
put a backlog item which rolls up to

289
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,320
feature resource up to epoch it has bugs

290
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,450
it has test cases it has tasks that's a

291
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,870
bunch of different things but I have

292
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,100
this these entries so this would be an

293
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:43,530
individual work item this one is a

294
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,230
backlog item and this backlog item has a

295
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,530
bunch of data associated with it just

296
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,390
like in the other tools so description

297
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,400
discussion and various things I've got a

298
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,490
follow link but I also have additional

299
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:01,020
things I can link to it and so I can

300
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:04,490
link to development items so here

301
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:09,210
there's a pull request and this is a

302
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:11,880
merged PR so that's a commit and a pull

303
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:14,730
request associated with it ok I also

304
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,240
link to existing other types of work

305
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,310
items so either related parent-child I

306
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,900
can actually link it to a github issue

307
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:27,690
by pasting in the github URL I can

308
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,440
relate all of these things together

309
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,780
which is kind of kind of nice I kind of

310
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,030
like that this is this is my tool of

311
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,550
choice for these kind of things and so

312
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:41,430
then if I go back into here and I go

313
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,610
into boards on boards I'm going to have

314
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:48,570
my cab on board so the default camera on

315
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:51,570
board and has the same States as the

316
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,480
work items so my work items here my

317
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,340
product backlog items and bugs go from

318
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,140
new to approved to forecast it to done

319
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,880
that's the the minimum you can have on

320
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,540
the board is what you've got set up in

321
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,160
the in the process but then each

322
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,890
individual team that's working in here

323
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,680
and this tool in particular supports

324
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:18,210
having multiple boards and multiple

325
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:21,230
teams inside the same project so I could

326
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:26,370
have and I do have customers that have

327
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:29,940
70 or 80 teams in a single project so

328
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:32,220
single source code 70 to 80 teams

329
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:36,030
working on one product they each have

330
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,800
their own boards backlog sprints but

331
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,600
they have some

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,640
commonality and they can share things

333
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,960
between the hidden link between each

334
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,520
other's stuff as well social

335
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,520
dependencies and that kind of thing so

336
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,770
here I'm just looking at a board so this

337
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,950
items in forecast state and I can drag

338
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,890
it around and you'll see that the state

339
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,340
changes from new to approve the forecast

340
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,620
it and once they get on to all the way

341
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,060
to the end to done they should be locked

342
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:07,550
off and finished that's the idea so I

343
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,760
can view it as a board a Kanban board I

344
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:12,410
can control this and I can do I'd have

345
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,110
some features telling me to control it

346
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:18,260
the first is what fields do I want to

347
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:21,320
show on each item that's pretty basic

348
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,480
and then some color coding rules I can

349
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,410
set up so I can set it up that things

350
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,150
glow if they've been changed recently or

351
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,760
if they've been tagged by a certain tag

352
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,810
that's that's always you can do that and

353
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:39,260
set up annotations for items that are in

354
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:41,240
github tasks or tests you saw that I

355
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,710
could link from that work item to other

356
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:47,530
things if it's tasks github issues or

357
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,840
tests they're actually going to show up

358
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,800
on this dashboard if you take that that

359
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,470
box and tests have a special some extra

360
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,870
features this is for manual testing not

361
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,210
for automated testing so this is when

362
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,860
you're transitioning into being an agile

363
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,270
team and you still have a lot of manual

364
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,700
tests and you want to bring them on

365
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,800
board and that's all supported in here I

366
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,960
don't expect a Joule teams to use a lot

367
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,850
of this and then you can set up and

368
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,590
control the columns so remember I said

369
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:21,500
that the minimum set of columns are the

370
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:25,180
columns from your work item so what what

371
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:30,950
set as the states but I could take

372
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:33,170
approved and I could break it into two

373
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,960
I'm just seeing if I can move that up I

374
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:39,440
can although I managed to click and do

375
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,580
that so if I want to break approved up

376
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,809
into two

377
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:49,250
columns and I can insert to the right so

378
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:52,900
this one I'm going to call it and

379
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,900
[Music]

380
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,769
refinement and then once we agree

381
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:05,169
refinement is complete this one is going

382
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:10,059
to be Oh Teddy ready

383
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:12,100
okay so refinement you can see the state

384
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,500
mappings as the state that is on the

385
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,200
work items and is the approved state

386
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:23,049
will be in refinement and the ready

387
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,940
state sorry the refinement column will

388
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,039
have items from the approved state and

389
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,500
the ready column will also have items

390
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,809
from the approved state and the system

391
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,940
will default them to one of the columns

392
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:35,740
because we just split a column where

393
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,230
there might be items in it and then you

394
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:42,100
can move things between it and that

395
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:45,490
allows us to each team even within the

396
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,029
same project and can set up their own

397
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,100
set of columns so you can say here's the

398
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:53,769
standard that our organization is going

399
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,070
to follow and which is new approved

400
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:58,720
forecast done that's our standard

401
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,370
everybody working on the one product has

402
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,440
to have the work items floor that so we

403
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,570
can understand what's going on we can

404
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,120
see a holistic view of everything in our

405
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,059
product everything in our work that's

406
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,669
going on but then each team can go and

407
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:15,730
set up and configure their boards

408
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:20,409
however they like in order to facilitate

409
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:22,389
them owning that managing that following

410
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:24,039
their own individual processes because

411
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:25,210
every team's work might be a little bit

412
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:27,580
different they work on different things

413
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,649
they have different types of work that

414
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,299
are going on inside that project that's

415
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,760
okay they can they can do that how they

416
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,539
like and you can set up additional

417
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,919
swimlanes

418
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:39,519
so by default there's only one

419
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:43,840
horizontal swimlane but you could set up

420
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:49,240
a swim lane for a particular stream of

421
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,539
work and I in the same understanding as

422
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:54,530
Daniel Vacanti in having different

423
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:58,940
classes of work

424
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:00,950
or classes of service is probably a bad

425
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,250
idea it's going to interrupt your

426
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,870
ability to flow on your other work and

427
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,550
you're better just improving your

428
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,670
overall flow so I would just leave it as

429
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:15,860
default but if a team did want to

430
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:20,350
experiment with an expedite except I

431
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:23,810
can't spell there we go and expedite

432
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,610
lane then they can do that as well and

433
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,790
then you can choose how cards are

434
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,320
ordered so do you drag them in between

435
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,550
if you have only a few things you might

436
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,310
want to have a set up this way if you

437
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,710
have hundreds of things on your backlog

438
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,930
because you're not that agile a team yet

439
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,420
you know you've got 300 things in your

440
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,160
sprint that can be a little bit much you

441
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,020
can set it so the order doesn't change

442
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,780
when you're dragging them around because

443
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,620
that can be a little bit difficult and

444
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,660
you can also display or hide two

445
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,850
different levels of backlog so many

446
00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:00,290
teams especially scrum teams working

447
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:02,240
with either just scrum or scrum and

448
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,290
Kanban are going to look just at backlog

449
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,960
items they don't really care about

450
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:09,370
anything else but if you've got much

451
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,810
bigger teams where you have more than

452
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:14,720
two teams working on one product you

453
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,820
might want to enable features and epics

454
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,880
as needed and then you can set up the

455
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,860
workdays and whether my bugs are treated

456
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,120
as backlog items or not that's why I

457
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,530
made a few changes there so I'm going to

458
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,240
save and close that and you'll see the

459
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:31,730
changes in the UI it's gonna refresh and

460
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,320
you'll see that I now have expedite

461
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,110
lanes so if I create a new product

462
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,999
backlog item

463
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm just gonna call it test because I'm

464
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:44,100
lazy I can drag that in to expedite and

465
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,489
then I can have I I might I and my team

466
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,070
might have agreed different rules for

467
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:52,720
expedite than for the default Lane and I

468
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,509
can have things flow through the system

469
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,549
like that so that that works pretty well

470
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:59,799
on boards just setting up and managing

471
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:04,179
Kanban boards it has whip limits it

472
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:06,039
doesn't force you to adhere to them this

473
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:08,470
tool doesn't really force you to do a

474
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,809
lot and it kind of leaves it open for

475
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,159
you to figure that out which is kind of

476
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,600
the way I like it that's how an agile

477
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,950
team should function because each team

478
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,119
should be able to choose to do things

479
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,619
differently if they want to break their

480
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:19,899
web them it's that's okay well they can

481
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:24,100
monitor their data and see how that goes

482
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:27,460
so I can do some analysis on here so

483
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,950
this is I don't have iteration set up so

484
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,470
it's not going to show velocity but it

485
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:35,830
would show a cumulative flow I have one

486
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,299
average work-in-progress because I don't

487
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,850
have a lot of work flowing across and

488
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:42,359
this team hasn't been worked on in a

489
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:44,679
little while so you can set up some

490
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:46,960
analysis these ones are the defaults and

491
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:51,869
then there's a feature timeline so you

492
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,249
might have some kind of dates or

493
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:57,789
expectations that you have to meet maybe

494
00:25:54,249 --> 00:26:01,149
there's a big event coming up that you

495
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,909
want to work towards or maybe have some

496
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:06,879
features and they are available for and

497
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:08,769
in order to do that oh I get new

498
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:11,200
features in progress in the timeline so

499
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,419
it's not going to show me the features

500
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,220
but I can create I have a feature

501
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:16,989
timeline that shows that I can create an

502
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,019
epoch roadmap which I also don't have

503
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:21,789
any epics so it's probably yeah I don't

504
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,559
have any epics assigned so it's probably

505
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:26,139
not going to show that either that's ok

506
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,259
I'll go back to boards so this is my

507
00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:31,830
backlog items board and all of those

508
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:35,470
things well at least a board and

509
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:38,710
analytics and are available at the

510
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:43,350
backlog level and if I went in and

511
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,350
enabled to do logs

512
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:53,820
if I enabled features and epics I could

513
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:56,909
also change to features and I would have

514
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:00,360
our board which you'll see it has only

515
00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:02,159
the default columns for features which

516
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,830
is new in progress done that's the

517
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,529
default and I can break that out if I

518
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,350
want that level but analytics is based

519
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,090
on the features and then feature

520
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,710
timeline is always features an epic word

521
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:16,940
map is always epics because the

522
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,909
expectation is features are something

523
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:24,480
the way a lot of decisions has been made

524
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:25,980
in this product is around as the way a

525
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,539
lot of teams inside of Microsoft work

526
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,220
because it's a Microsoft tool and

527
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:33,080
Microsoft use it extensively internally

528
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:36,149
so backlog items are just backlog items

529
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,659
features are looked at as something that

530
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:41,490
you're going to deliver and so while you

531
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,970
might deploy a backlog item out to

532
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:47,879
production it's not a tangible finished

533
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:49,860
thing that you might want to see a

534
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,299
timeline of when are those things going

535
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,909
to be finished what's currently in

536
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:55,200
progress at the moment for that feature

537
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:57,659
so if you think about it the development

538
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,340
team and the product owner at the

539
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,830
implementation level cared a lot about

540
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:07,019
the backlog items at the feature level

541
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:09,450
you're looking at holistic units of of

542
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,440
things that go together backlog items

543
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,019
obviously are broken down into smaller

544
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,090
items and then epics are things that

545
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,610
appear on your road back maybe a longer

546
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,549
lived it's gonna take many many Sprint's

547
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,440
to get them get them get them finished

548
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:25,559
many releases to get them finished

549
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,690
that's the way that looks so that's at

550
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:31,259
boards in here it also has backlogs

551
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:35,070
backlogs are super handy and I find to

552
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,749
be very underused with teams so in here

553
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,850
I just have a list of the items that on

554
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:41,279
my backlog and I can drag and drop them

555
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,059
to order them I can also go and stick

556
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,149
them in sprints and I can configure and

557
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:50,220
control the sprints and set them up so

558
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:52,649
that will let me set up my backlogs and

559
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,310
again it has analytics and access the

560
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:58,010
feature type line and the epic roadmap

561
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,290
there's they're the same so what can

562
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:04,760
view that as a board or I came for so if

563
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,680
I go to Oh wrong button views a board it

564
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,270
takes me back here views a backlog it

565
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,400
flips to that other view so backlog is

566
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:15,290
the view board is also a view and it's

567
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,020
the same data it's the same data so I

568
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,450
can use this across multiple teams the

569
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:22,040
boards even have auto updating so if

570
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,780
you're looking at it on multiple screens

571
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,780
it will automatically update as you go

572
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,310
through which is kinda nice so I've

573
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,300
already talked about those features but

574
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:34,490
now I'm in a backlog view I'm not sure

575
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,640
that's gonna configure the team settings

576
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,760
so it's just gonna have that yep and so

577
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,950
the current sprint plus whatever other

578
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,690
ones you have currently figured

579
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,010
configured are going to be listed in

580
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,660
there there's lots of different ways to

581
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,300
set up and configure Sprint's I have a

582
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,910
number of blog posts on how to do that

583
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:55,370
for one team and how to do that for

584
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,190
hundreds of teams working on one product

585
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,990
and and also how to do lots of different

586
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,480
products inside of the one project as

587
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,060
well which many organizations do for

588
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,100
various reasons and so I have a lot of

589
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:10,280
blog posts on those topics you can go

590
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:12,940
look at those you can also if you are a

591
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,640
scrum team and not just a Kanban team or

592
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:18,830
you're a scrum and Kanban team or a

593
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,720
Kanban with a little bit of scrum team

594
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,690
or just a Kanban team or just a scrum

595
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,640
team all of these features work well you

596
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,580
would just ignore that sprints tap

597
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:31,490
because you wouldn't need it but if you

598
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,130
are using that you'll see you can have

599
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,960
your PBIS that have brought into the

600
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,760
sprint pin to the left and you can have

601
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,080
break that down into tasks that then

602
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:47,330
flow across the board I recommend

603
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:49,490
working as a team using the Kanban guide

604
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,740
for scrum teams I think it's really

605
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,140
important to have good metric

606
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:58,250
cross-cutting metrics that you can rely

607
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:01,040
on and user stories story points and

608
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,980
velocity it does not give you that it

609
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,260
might give you that for one team early

610
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,480
on in their maturity level but if you

611
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,920
want to mature scrum team they need to

612
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,690
start

613
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,310
looking at the Kanban guide for scrum

614
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,520
teams and bringing in some of those more

615
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:18,670
advanced metrics to look at but in here

616
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,580
and I've got my task board I can see

617
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,470
that's so that's my scrum board you

618
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,450
might call it but it's just a list of

619
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,210
tasks relating to the things on your

620
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:32,710
backlog and I can look at the breakdown

621
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:37,890
of my backlog so let's see and might a

622
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:40,600
sport and I break this item into task 1

623
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,880
task do there we go

624
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,740
and I can go to the backlog and I'll see

625
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,600
that this has been broken down so

626
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:51,820
they're actually related and if I open

627
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:55,450
that task do you'll see as a link up to

628
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:58,330
the pbi product backlog item that I have

629
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:03,040
there it's pretty straight for kind of

630
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:04,960
like you would expect it to have um so

631
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,440
there are some other tools there are

632
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,440
some teams out there that like to look

633
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,290
at their capacity and plan towards that

634
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,960
so this is not meant as a project

635
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,330
management tool it does not have the

636
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,660
features that you would expect in a

637
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:25,000
project management tool however if I'm a

638
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:27,370
team and I just want to get an idea of

639
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,450
what my capacity is for this sprint as

640
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,710
opposed to the previous sprint or I have

641
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,930
people who take on different sets of

642
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,330
tasks I can add some of those things in

643
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:40,690
I tend not to use those features in

644
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,570
capacity I just ignore that to be honest

645
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,940
I now tend to ignore the task board as

646
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,500
well but if I have an immature team I

647
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,320
might have to look at one of those

648
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,240
things I might need some of that data

649
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,330
and then hopefully as we scale up the

650
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,610
team as we scale up the project and the

651
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,760
people around we can start ditching some

652
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:06,000
of those things as well so I can view

653
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:08,980
this either from our backlog basis or I

654
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,810
should be able to change that - so it's

655
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:16,450
filtering and where is view options

656
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:19,570
there we go so instead of looking at it

657
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:22,930
from a backlog items on the left and

658
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,550
tasks I could flip to people on the left

659
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,120
and what tasks are saying to them

660
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,800
flowing across and I can also have work

661
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,230
details and planning so I can move

662
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:36,220
things to other Sprint's and do those

663
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,870
things all in the UI and I can create

664
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,460
queries if I just want to go find a

665
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:46,390
bunch of work items or I want to load

666
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:48,100
them out into Excel or for don't do it

667
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,420
but if you need to load them into MS

668
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,290
Project you could do that as well but

669
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:57,610
don't tell anybody you can just create a

670
00:33:53,290 --> 00:34:00,310
query build a query in here for finding

671
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,130
work items in your system emailing them

672
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,290
around all of those kind of things

673
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,020
there's also a tool called plans which

674
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:11,320
is about how do you plan work for

675
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:15,310
multiple teams working together and it

676
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,530
allows you to create plans add teams and

677
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,660
their backlogs to the plan and see

678
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:22,960
what's going on across our much larger

679
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,280
team so if you had an access and you

680
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,200
were using the nexxus framework you

681
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,070
could set it up and it would also

682
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,690
support things like safe they would

683
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:37,330
support more non agile methods like say

684
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,440
for waterfall or other things you can

685
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,920
you can do that in here

686
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,810
and if you're following more agile

687
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,640
techniques so you're looking at DevOps

688
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,930
you're looking it at scrum you're

689
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,430
looking at time and you're looking at

690
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:55,810
any of the reducing cycle time figure it

691
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:57,700
out as you go along ideas then you will

692
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,860
be able to use some of these features in

693
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,120
that way as well again it's going to

694
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,430
have features that you're not gonna need

695
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,960
if you're in either category or features

696
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,300
you're not gonna like to use if you're

697
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,400
in either category but it's because

698
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,370
there are lots of teams doing lots of

699
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:18,160
different things um I've also added a

700
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:19,980
couple of plugins to this I have a tool

701
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,330
from Daniel Vacanti

702
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,430
actionable agile I just have the demo

703
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:27,760
and looks like my free trials expired

704
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:35,830
but this allows you to do some really

705
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:36,670
powerful analysis of the data and as a

706
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,010
tool from

707
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,609
Vacanti from his companies or Google

708
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:47,079
look up at actionable agile analytics I

709
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:50,740
also have dependency tracker in there

710
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,750
which one of the MVPs built I think I

711
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,400
don't know what this will load might not

712
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,789
be pretty because I haven't used it in a

713
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,599
while no there's no dependencies based

714
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:08,049
on my criteria but it's all tools to

715
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:12,339
play around with so those were the three

716
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:14,559
tools and that I've used reasonably

717
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:20,019
extensively I've also looked at and used

718
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:22,720
Trello on occasion and I've also looked

719
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:27,549
at other tools that are out there as

720
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,680
well but not in any great great depth

721
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:33,400
these are the tools that I've used in

722
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,750
anger with teams figuring out how things

723
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,849
go together how to organize that so I'm

724
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:43,839
gonna take a quick look and see if there

725
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:46,480
are any questions I think we're not

726
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,890
streaming on YouTube because it wasn't

727
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:54,730
working properly and but everything else

728
00:36:50,890 --> 00:37:00,099
is maybe no it's maybe not I'm not going

729
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:03,819
to percent sure I would need to go if

730
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:08,289
there are any questions I can answer

731
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:10,829
them I can also take questions on this

732
00:37:08,289 --> 00:37:15,940
URL that I will answer in the next

733
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:17,529
session I'm quite happy to take that in

734
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:23,140
the next session and if you come back to

735
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:26,140
our YouTube channel which is I don't

736
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:30,069
have it up there but it's nkd agility

737
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,690
net /tv you will get to our YouTube

738
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:33,220
channel where everything streams on

739
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,930
there except for this one because I

740
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:40,059
think it's not actually working so I

741
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:46,839
will have to look at that after this and

742
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:49,529
figure that out so if there are no

743
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,529
questions

744
00:37:49,980 --> 00:38:01,770
then I will will have to figure out why

745
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,800
YouTube's not working nevermind

746
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:08,820
so hopefully um you got something useful

747
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,200
out of this I'm going to share Jul this

748
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,880

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,830
schedules going to be yet but I'm going

750
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,290
