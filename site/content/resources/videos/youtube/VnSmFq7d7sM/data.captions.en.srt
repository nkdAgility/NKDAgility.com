1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,440
okay so um if i uh scroll down my page

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,880
you can see that this uh list here is

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
rendered vertically rather than

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
horizontally and that's supposed to have

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,680
bootstrap

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,000
uh loaded and if i view the page source

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,680
f

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,279
you'll see that the bootstrap code

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,880
is not

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,279
in here

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
however if i go to

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,840
my dashboard

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
and i go to

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,120
where the

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
elementor

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
custom code

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,480
uh you'll see boot trap bootstrap head

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
um so if i edit that

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
these are all the same body they all

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,800
exist on all the pages you'll see um

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
here's the code that i expect to see

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
which i do not see

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,120
and then on the right hand side here you

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,879
can see its entire site

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,600
okay so this should

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
be

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
in here however it's

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,680
not in here

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,360
and none of the predefined code elements

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
are appearing there and if i click on

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
edit conditions

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,960
and you see i just go save and close

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,840
um i get an error message and there is

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
no

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
uh

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,439
more details than that

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
uh if i go check my error messages which

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,040
i might need to open in your browser to

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,040
do that

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
error logs

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,159
current error logs

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,640
here is the current

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,119
uh error log and you can see that all

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,280
i've got is some elementor pro upgrade i

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
tried to downgrade elementor pro don't

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
get me started it didn't work totally

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,280
garbled the whole site so i rolled back

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
to previous version

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
um

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,280
but anyway uh uh the site is there and

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
none of these

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,720
error messages are actually listed for

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
for that so that's the error messages

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
there

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
uh

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,560
so on the main website

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,959
um you can see that the

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,040
it has the impact some things are built

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
using um

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
bootstrap in the background so this

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,120
isn't loading

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,200
and

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
if i go to one of my courses

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
this is supposed to be in two columns

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,120
not loading

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,959
um and this is supposed to have a box

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,879
around it with a different color not

68
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,680
loading so i don't use it for a lot of

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,400
stuff but the stuff i do use it for

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,840
is important um but

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
that as well both um that code for

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,280
bootstrap

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,680
and if i go back to elementor and custom

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
code

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,959
uh the linkedin stuff not loading uh

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,760
the end the start none of this none of

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,640
this stuff is uh

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,720
being rendered in the front end

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
they all have high priority um i've

80
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,480
tried clearing all the caches doing all

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
of those things completely resetting

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
everything uh doesn't make a difference

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
and if i

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
install a previous version of elementor

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,440
it works uh with the

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,159
one version back it works

87
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,000
this version does not work

88
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,400
um

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
let's check because you'll probably ask

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,200
about themes

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
and i am using i think i'm using your

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,840
hello elementor

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,959
theme it says the new version even if i

94
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,959
update to the new version um it does not

95
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,840
make any difference it doesn't make any

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,040
difference to the to the to the output

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,040
of those rendered

98
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,879
software bits code custom code
