Is a Scrum Master an agile micromanager? 

If a Scrum Master is an agile micromanager, they're doing it wrong. A Scrum Master is there to facilitate, perhaps to teach, but not to micromanage. Not to tell people what to do, not to tell people where to do it. 

Don't be a Scrum Master micromanager. You're not a project manager; you're focused on the effectiveness of the team, and the team can't be effective if you're micromanaging every decision that they make and everything that they do.
