1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,900
the question is

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,179
what

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,940
would be a great

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,940
ideal Consulting outcome for a customer

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,400
and that's that's a that's an

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,160
interesting question because I think

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,439
it's different for every customer right

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,439
but It ultimately comes down to

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,340
trying to think of the right words and

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,260
the right phrasing

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,100
it

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,820
it comes down to being able to

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,680
consistently deal with surprise

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,200
not sure that's the best way to describe

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,200
it right but

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,260
the reality of the world is that things

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,500
are changing and happening all the time

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,140
and businesses have

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,000
two types of surprises they can have

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,140
there's positive surprises negative

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
surprises

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,280
positive surprises they want to be able

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,439
to take advantage of negative surprises

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
they want to be able to like let's make

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,939
sure that doesn't mess with us

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,740
and

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,000
though they're they're because they're

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,080
surprises you don't know what they're

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,299
going to be you don't know when they're

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,640
gonna happen you have to have a system

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,220
that is able to roll with it

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,780
and most organizations are very very

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,380
rigid

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,380
so an ideal outcome for

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,299
an agile Consulting engagement is that

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,259
the organization has less

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,119
bureaucracy and more adaptability right

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,220
I mean that's that's ultimately what

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,619
organizations are trying to do

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,060
the the difficulty is that there's

41
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,060
there's two fundamental

42
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,460
mental constructs that are seem to be

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,100
seem to be mutually exclusive

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,140
and it's very hard to move from one to

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,820
the other and it's very easy to move

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,979
from the other to the one right this is

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,880
the bit that's difficult is that you you

48
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,759
have that that that tayloristic

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,160
type of organization which is top-down

50
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,739
command and control 18th century

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,660
Industrial Revolution thinking right

52
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,220
that's their that's their their model

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,260
that pyramid model

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,300
and then you've got

55
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,120
organizations over all the way over on

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,800
the other side which are fewer in number

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:32,640
who are completely decentralized

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,500
um node-based organizations where the

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,200
people making the decisions are the

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,580
people that are up close to the market

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,080
whereas in the the pyramid organizations

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,420
the people making the decisions are

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,879
furthest away from the market right the

64
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,000
CEO my one of my favorite quotes is from

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,099
Simon saidek yes absolutely simonsonic

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,959
so one of my favorite quotes is from

67
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,239
Simon siniak

68
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,440
um and and he talked about speaking to a

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,099
CEO

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,620
and saying to the to the CEO or the CEO

71
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,819
saying you know I know what my customers

72
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,980
want

73
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,379
and Simon says to him well you haven't

74
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,540
spoken to a customer than 15 years how

75
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,220
would you know what they wanted and that

76
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,500
that's the person that's furthest away

77
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,580
from the market is making all of the

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,540
decisions

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:21,000
whereas in the the

80
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,280
node-based organization that the CEO is

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,920
at the center providing services to the

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
organization there is there he's the

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,379
cost center right the CEO or he or she

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,580
the CEO is the cost center and the rest

85
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,440
of the organization is the value

86
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,599
creation and they're interacting

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,860
directly with the market invoicing

88
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,480
getting money from the customers so

89
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,819
ultimately the ultimate goal is to move

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,980
from that top-down terroristic

91
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,980
organization towards this node-based

92
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,980
people-orientated

93
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,040
it was Mary Follett so I guess follicism

94
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,120
Follow Tight I don't know organizations

95
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,340
I'm gonna thing over here but it's very

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,900
hard to move from tayloristic to

97
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,239
politistic

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,819
okay but really easy to fall back the

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,879
other way because all you need is for

100
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,939
Rigamortis to set in to move back to

101
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,239
that rigid top-down model because that's

102
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:21,479
what it is and one of the things that I

103
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,940
think a successful

104
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:28,580
agile consultant will do

105
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,800
is work with people in that organization

106
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,479
to help them have a more flexible

107
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,240
mindset

108
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,540
so from from top down

109
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,900
left to right at all levels you want

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,479
every single person in your organization

111
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:52,259
to be thinking about how do I remain

112
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:54,020
Nimble how do I remain adaptable how do

113
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,479
I Stave off

114
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,740
the rigor mortis right that is that is

115
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,520
bureaucracy

116
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,620
and that needs to be in in in every part

117
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,419
of the organization it's not uh

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,880
something that you can just hire

119
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:11,160
somebody in and they install in your

120
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,600
organization is every single individual

121
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,180
in your organization needs to be part of

122
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,280
that story so successful agile

123
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,660
Consulting looks like

124
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,460
um um

125
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,259
building understanding in the

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,240
organization

127
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,139
um building

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,240
um

129
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,699
tools that people in the organization

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,440
can use to remain Nimble otherwise

131
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,900
they'll fall back to the age-old tools

132
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,840
that everybody talks about

133
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,880
um and and not being there full time

134
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,139
right it's like it's almost like a

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,120
crutch when and somebody is there full

136
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,680
time it's a crutch for the organization

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,880
they need to learn to stand on their own

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,440
they need to learn to make their own

139
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,580
mistakes

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,620
um so that

141
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,360
I know that probably doesn't really

142
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,560
answer that question of what does it

143
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,900
look like

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,120
right but I think what it looks like is

145
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,919
different in every organization I I

146
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,199
could articulate what it looks like it

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,139
at Microsoft although they're only some

148
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,139
way along that transition towards that

149
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,120
that that that that that goal

150
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,740
every organization is completely

151
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,479
different and it's so different because

152
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,860
their Market is different their products

153
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,979
are different their people are different

154
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,000
and there's no one right way to to

155
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,000
answer that question
