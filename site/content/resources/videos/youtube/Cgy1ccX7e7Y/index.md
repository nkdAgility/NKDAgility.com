# What would be an example of a great agile consulting outcome for a client?

In simple or complicated environments, like civil engineering, #projectmanagement works a treat. We know how to build a road, we know who is best positioned to build the road, we know how long it takes to build the road, and we have a great idea of how much it costs to build that road.

When you step into a complex environment, everything changes because the problem you are trying to solve has never been solved before. The solution you are trying to create has never been created before. So, you don't know what you don't know, and there are way too many variables to guess upfront, so you need to approach things differently.

This is where things get tricky because it doesn't help to simply throw your hands up and tell #leadership and #executive teams that you don't know, and cannot know, until you have actually solved the problem or built the solution.

There has to be a bridge. A way of moving effectively from the initial starting point, through each iteration and evolution, until you have created the most valuable product or solved the most compelling problem.

#agile is a great approach to this kind of #productdevelopment and has proven itself time and again over the past 25 years. So, if your organization hire an #agileconsultant to achieve increased #businessagility and critical business objectives, how will you know that the engagement is creating value?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood provides some examples of valuable outcomes that could emerge from an #agileconsulting engagement.
