A massive gap.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>In the <strong>product development</strong> world, we talk a lot about scrum. <strong>Scrum</strong> is not the only <strong>agile framework</strong> out there, but it is by far the most popular and widely adopted product development framework in the world, so it gets a lot of attention.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It’s the way most people articulate <strong>agile product development</strong> or dare I say it, <strong>agile project management</strong>, so scrum terminology is widely used and understood.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>That said, scrum is simply a framework.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Whilst it will highlight the importance of a solid product backlog, it won’t tell you how to populate it or how to create the most valuable product backlog. Same for a sprint backlog. It tells you that you need one, but it doesn’t tell you how to do it or what you should do.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>How do you know what you should include in a product backlog?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>How do you know if what you have included is the most valuable work?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>How do you prioritize the items in the product backlog?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>How do you know whether the items in the backlog are the right things to be delivering?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>And so forth.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>So, there is a gap between what gets fed into the <strong>agile framework</strong> and how the agile framework ensures that the work flows effectively throughout the system.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>If you have a great <strong>product owner</strong> and the team have a great working relationship with the customer, it gets easier to do the selection of work items well, but there is still a gap between deciding what is the most valuable work to do and doing that work effectively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Most teams will get the execution right. In fact, most teams do that so well that you often find what is known as ‘feature factories’ in the scrum world. A team so efficient and effective that they churn out features every week, with little to no thought as to whether those features are valuable.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>The difference between effective and productive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>This gap is what the PSU (professional scrum with User Exprerience) addresses.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-professional-scrum-with-ux-user-experience\">Professional Scrum with UX (User Experience)</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>The <strong>PSU course</strong> or <a href=\"https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/courses/professional-scrum-with-user-experience-psu-live-virtual-training-with-certification/\">Professional Scrum with UX course</a> focuses on two (2) main areas.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\r\n<ol type=\"1\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>How do we integrate all the ideas generated by the <strong>UX</strong> experts into the product ownership world.

It isn’t a part of how they ordinarily work, nor has it ever been a part of what they do.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>So, things get built that cause problems down the line.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Things get built that solve the immediate problem and fit into the ‘good enough to ship’ category but don’t serve or enhance the user experience at all.
