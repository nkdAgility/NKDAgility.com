1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,480
why is the PSU so popular for product

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,300
development teams

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,179
um because there's a gap does this

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,500
massive gaps

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,820
we talk a lot about in the product

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,039
development world we talk a lot about

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,160
scrum right scrum's not the only process

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,340
but it is the predominant process it's

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,800
the way most people uh talk about agile

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,420
and product development today it's the

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,399
way most people

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,320
um characterize and phrase it right they

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,960
use scrum terminology and the way they

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,379
speak it's kind of been been adopted

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,059
um but scrum itself does not talk about

16
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,520
where where do you get your backlog from

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,440
right it just says have a backlog have

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,899
it ordered that's product backlog here

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,219
it is what where does it come from how

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,140
do you know what you should put in there

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,280
how do you know if the things you put in

22
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,100
there and that you've delivered are

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,660
actually the right thing and that's kind

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000
of the purpose of the the the the

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,160
learnings that come out of the the PSU

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
and so the professional scrum with user

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,939
experience looks at

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,799
um kind of two things one is how do we

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,680
integrate all of those I ideas

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,360
that have come out of the expert an

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,180
awesome work done in the user experience

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,759
world how do we integrate that into the

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,540
product ownership world right product

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,700
owners are often user experience experts

35
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,220
or have access to user experience

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,280
experts who are able to help them

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,500
formulate a a more of a hypothesis

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,060
driven engineering practice where

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,560
they're looking forward not only looking

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,259
forward into the future and figuring out

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,180
what it is we need next but also looking

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,100
into the past of what we have delivered

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,600
and did it actually provide the value we

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,520
need or do we need it to be slightly

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,899
slightly different so there's a lot of

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,860
awesome work in there that's really

47
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,979
important

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,759
and but quite often the experts in that

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,460
space have to spend too much time

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,380
um fixing I'm going to phrase this badly

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,420
but fixing the problems that the

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,459
engineering teams create because they

53
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,920
don't understand those things so

54
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,200
engineering teams make decisions just

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,900
like with lack of security right you

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,480
make decisions based on I need to get

57
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,140
this work done not on how do I support

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,580
this holistic long-term infinite uh uh

59
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,080
game that we're playing of delivering

60
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,040
valuable product

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,879
so by those experts

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,140
um encouraging and enabling the

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:41,099
engineering teams to take on the parts

64
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:45,000
of that work that don't need the Deep

65
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:50,000
expertise they just need some so skills

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,580
right the PSU enables engineering teams

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,620
to make better decisions

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,300
so that

69
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,180
that

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,340
enables them to understand the

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,019
additional value that those deep experts

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,879
and user experience bring to that story

73
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,580
and the hypothesis-driven engineering

74
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,379
bring to that story as so they respect

75
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,500
that more because they understand how it

76
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,720
fits into their story but also the

77
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,239
engineering team can take

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:25,260
a lot of that lower level work of of

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,500
perhaps Gathering the data perhaps

80
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,080
um um and you know actually implementing

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,560
the test of the hypothesis

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,260
off the plate of the experts and give

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,180
them more time to dive more deeply into

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,159
the the expertise and what does the

85
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,959
future look like in strategizing and

86
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,159
planning for the future and figuring out

87
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,360
whether we've actually built the right

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,540
things

89
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,879
so for me that that value of the the PSU

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,099
is in bringing those two worlds together

91
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,780
more closely in in in uh um giving the

92
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,360
teams the understanding of user

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,920
experience that they need uh to respect

94
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,519
it and value it

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,980
and giving the user experience uh folks

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,959
enough understanding of what the

97
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,959
engineering teams are trying to do and

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,060
how they can incorporate their work and

99
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,880
engage with the engineering teams so

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,799
that um it we have more successful

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,600
outcomes and hopefully everybody sees

102
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,340
the value of having these these

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,900
cross-functional teams not necessarily

104
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,060
cross-functional individuals but

105
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,600
cross-functional teams where you have

106
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,080
user experience on the team so that

107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,820
they're able to work closely with the

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,340
product owner to help build out new

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,300
ideas as well as work work with the team

110
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,820
during the Sprint in order to to to make

111
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,380
sure that the ideas we are building ours

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,680
are as valuable and successful as

113
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,680
possible
