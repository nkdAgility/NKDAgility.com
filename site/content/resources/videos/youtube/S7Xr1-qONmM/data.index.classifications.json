The content addresses collaborative decision-making and distributed cognition, but only in a human context. It does not mention or even imply teams comprised of both humans and AI, nor explore socio-technical or ethical issues around human-AI collaboration. Therefore, while the audience and product context align, the main ideas, purpose, and depth fall outside the intended category. Scores reflect minimal mention/fit, but strong audience fit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content details human collaboration and integrating UX in Scrum, but does not mention or explore AI or human-AI teamwork. It does not fit the 'Collective Intelligence' category, which requires a focus on human-AI collaborative intelligence, not just effective human teams.",

The focus is on bridging product development and UX within Scrum, detailing the aims and design of the PSU course. While it explores agile concepts such as value delivery, empiricism, and decision-making, there is no language, framework, or strategic context that demonstrates any substantive or even indirect relation to OKRs—neither as a system nor as an outcome-based measurement approach per John Doerr’s definition. The intent, depth, and relevance are closely mapped to Agile, Scrum, UX, and product development improvement, not OKR principles. Accordingly, confidence and all scoring dimensions must remain extremely low.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses the popularity and value of the PSU course, focusing on integrating user experience with Scrum in product development. While some themes like decision-making, cross-functional collaboration, and hypothesis-driven development could conceptually relate to aspects of Agentic Engineering (e.g., feedback-driven adaptation and agency in decision-making), the primary emphasis is on bridging UX and Scrum, not the deliberate maximisation of human or AI agency, ethical autonomy, or DevOps-infused craft as defined by Agentic Engineering. There are no direct mentions or explicit references to Agentic Engineering concepts, practices, or terms. The depth is moderate, focusing on practical improvements to Scrum teams rather than the philosophical framing or engineering practices of Agentic Engineering. The audience (Scrum practitioners and agile teams) is fairly well-aligned, but the signal is diluted somewhat by generic agile/Scrum promotion. No penalties apply since the content is recent, not contradictory, nor outdated.",

Although it discusses decision-making and collaboration, it does not explicitly address the core concepts of Agentic Engineering, such as maximizing human and AI agency or systemic observability.",
