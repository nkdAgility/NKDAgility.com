# Why do you think the PSU course has become so popular for product development?

Scrum.Org recently released the PSU (Professional Scrum with User Experience) course with the objective of helping #scrum #productdevelopment teams become more effective in identifying, creating, and capturing value for customers.

#scrum is built on the idea of building and nurturing cross-functional skills in teams, and whilst User Experience (#ux) has traditionally been a stand-alone role in design or #projectmanagement, #scrum looks to include #ux into the #scrum team and decision-making process.

So, how come the #psu course has become so popular? How is it empowering teams to make great #productdevelopment decisions, and build more valuable products? In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why and how that is happening.
