I think Simon is one of the best APS trainers out there. He's really focused on delivering in that space, and in doing so, he created the Minecraft case study in the EPS. Having run it myself as well, I believe it connects people to the work far better than any of the other case studies. It really demonstrates the complexity of the work and connects back to the way we work in the office, although it doesn't seem that way when you think about it, right? Minecraft. But it is far more effective, and that's why I trust Simon.
