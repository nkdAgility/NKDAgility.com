1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:10,080
I think Simon is one of the best APS

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,059
trainers out there he's really focused

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,980
um on delivering delivering in that

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,820
space and in doing so he he created uh

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,760
the the Minecraft case study in the EPS

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,480
which having it run it myself as well I

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,320
I believe connects people uh to the to

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,540
the work far better than any of the

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,579
other case studies and it really

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,340
demonstrates the complexity of the work

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,899
it really demonstrates and connects back

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,219
to the way we work in the office

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
although it doesn't seem that way when

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,140
you think about it right Minecraft but

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,920
it is far more effective and that's why

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,920
I trust Simon
