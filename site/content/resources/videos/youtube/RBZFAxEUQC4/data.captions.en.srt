1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,799
one of the seven deadly sins of agile is

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,039
lust is is loads of

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:21,560
organizations are um talking

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,760
about agile transformation digital

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,039
transformation whatever

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,400
transformation they they want something

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,640
different because they've

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,520
realized that the mark markets have

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,360
changed right it's taken them a long

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,760
time to realize the markets have changed

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,040
they changed years ago right in fact

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,079
1930s was when the market started to

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,920
change 1970s they were totally changed

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,079
and it's taken until now for a lot of

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,480
companies to actually realize oh [Â __Â ]

16
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,360
stuff's changed what's going on right

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,000
why why isn't our old processes and

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,559
systems uh uh working so now they're

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
looking around for something new they've

20
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,680
got that I was going to say 7year itch

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,799
right but it's the 70E itch um and

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,119
they're looking around for new processes

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,960
and practices that they can use and they

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,119
see this agile thing doing really well

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,280
and they want it right they want they

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,520
want it desperately and they don't

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,159
really want to do the work for

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,840
it they just want to buy it I think

29
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,040
there must be a useis for that but I

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,119
think I'll stay away from it um they

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,079
just want to they just want to buy this

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
thing they don't want to actually spend

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:34,399
the effort and the time and the energy

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,520
to figure out what it means for them and

35
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,119
their business they just want somebody

36
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,159
else to come in and install it they just

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,719
want to pay somebody to come in and do

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,439
it for them right that's what they want

39
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,880
to do and that's why you see a lot of

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,560
organizations bringing in and you know

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,240
the big four Consulting companies you

42
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,840
see McKenzie and Accenture and Boston

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Consulting Group coming in um giving

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,320
giving giving advice but the problem is

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,079
they're giving advice based on all of

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,440
these other big organizational

47
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,640
Transformations there is no precedent

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,000
within your organization for agile you

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,800
can't just look at what somebody else is

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,599
doing and lust after it and bring it

51
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,120
into your organization you need to build

52
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:28,720
your own unique way of doing things over

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,280
time and actually do the work to get

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,200
there and

55
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,120
that's uh why you can't just lust after

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,440
this agile thing you need to do the work

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
