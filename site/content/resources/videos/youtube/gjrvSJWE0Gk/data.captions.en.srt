1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
so the applying metrics for

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,200
predictability course from Pro caman is

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:14,759
really focused on a deep dive into how

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,480
you can use the the the the metrics um

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,359
coming from your camand strategy to

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,960
really focus on improving the

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,119
predictability of of your teams right

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,119
the predictability of our ability to

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:32,559
deliver um so we need to understand uh

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,120
uh what the impact of the changes like

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,680
how we want to change the metrics in

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,399
order to improve predictability how do

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,480
we identify uh uh in the graphs what

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,840
things might be the issue like how um

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,640
how do

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,719
we uh uh interpret interpret the graphs

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,600
in order to maximize uh uh that that

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,120
changes to predictability um and how do

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,960
we make uh forecasts right make accurate

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,000
forecasts for for single items for

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,600
multiple items looking forward into the

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,680
future to understand what we're going to

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,360
do do next um and really lots of teams

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,520
struggle with the two questions when

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
will it be done and how much will I how

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,560
much work will I get um these are really

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
important questions that the business

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,720
has that most teams are unable to answer

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,600
and these metrics for predictability

30
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,000
really bring that answer to the to the

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,880
Forefront how do you in how do you what

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,479
data do you collect how do you interpret

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,280
the graphs how do you analyze that data

34
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,920
in order to make good choices around

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,200
increasing predictability um and how do

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,119
you improve the FL upflow of value into

37
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,079
production um how do you increase the

38
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,680
flow of value to the business which is
