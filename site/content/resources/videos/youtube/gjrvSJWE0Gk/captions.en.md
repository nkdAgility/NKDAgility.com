So the applying metrics for predictability course from Pro Caman is really focused on a deep dive into how you can use the metrics coming from your Caman strategy to really focus on improving the predictability of your teams. Right, the predictability of our ability to deliver. 

So we need to understand what the impact of the changes is, like how we want to change the metrics in order to improve predictability. How do we identify in the graphs what things might be the issue? Like how do we interpret the graphs in order to maximise those changes to predictability? 

And how do we make forecasts, right? Make accurate forecasts for single items, for multiple items, looking forward into the future to understand what we're going to do next. 

And really, lots of teams struggle with the two questions: when will it be done and how much work will I get? These are really important questions that the business has that most teams are unable to answer. And these metrics for predictability really bring that answer to the forefront. 

How do you, what data do you collect? How do you interpret the graphs? How do you analyse that data in order to make good choices around increasing predictability? And how do you improve the flow of value into production? 

How do you increase the flow of value to the business, which is what we're all here for? If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility dot com. 

We also have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.
