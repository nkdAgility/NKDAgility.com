## Unpacking the Differences

A newbie vs professional Scrum Master could be considered a misconception.

Allow me to explain why.

In the Agile world, and particularly in Scrum, answering an intriguing question like the title of this article can be tricky. Still, as I'm often asked, - "What's the difference between a newbie Scrum Master and a professional Scrum Master?" I'll tackle it and let's look at the differences together.  🎯

Is There Such a Thing as a 'Newbie' or a 'Professional' Scrum Master?

Before we dive into the possibility of a misconception, I'd like to take a moment to challenge these terms.

In my opinion, the concept of a 'newbie' or 'professional' Scrum Master doesn't quite exist.  🤔

Surprised? Let me explain.

You don't become a Scrum Master as a newbie. Instead, you step into the role because you've showcased competence within your team. The moment you take accountability as a Scrum Master, you're an experienced, effective professional.

When you take on the role of a Scrum Master, you're no longer a novice. 🏅

You've shown your ability to help them become more effective. That's not the work of a newbie; that's the work of a professional! 🌟

Conversely, there's no such thing as a 'professional' Scrum Master.

The Scrum Guide, which I regard as our Scrum 'bible', doesn't mention such terms. There is only the Scrum Master. The term 'Professional Scrum Master' is more of a branding choice by Scrum.org to emphasise the professionalism required in this role.

## What Does it Mean to be a 'Professional' Scrum Master?

So, what does 'professional' mean here? 🏆

It's all about emphasising that being a Scrum Master is not playtime. It's a professional role that adds value to both the team and the organisation.

The term 'Professional Scrum Master' aims to underscore the importance of approaching the Scrum Master role professionally. This role is not a game. It's a serious commitment that provides value to the team and the organisation.

As a Scrum Master, you're accountable for tasks that, if everyone on the team were to take on, would hinder their ability to get things done.

Therefore, a person whom the team respects picks up these responsibilities, ensuring everyone else can focus on delivering valuable products. 👩‍💻

## Wearing the Hat of a Scrum Master Professionally

A professional Scrum Master is not just a title. 🚀

Being a Scrum Master means being professional about it - not just playing the part, but taking action.

If, during Sprint Planning, you're telling your team they haven't taken on enough work or assigning tasks to individuals, you're not being a professional Scrum Master.

Instead, a true Scrum Master, in the spirit of professionalism and Agile methodology, would instead focus on enhancing the team's effectiveness.

The Scrum Master works towards eliminating ineffective practices and fostering those that boost the team's productivity.

## The Bottom Line of a Scrum Master: Just Do It!

To wrap things up, what we're talking about from a professional Scrum Master perspective is: 'just do it'.  

Don't just fiddle about at the edges or get caught up in tinkering on the fringes either, but truly embrace the role.  - adopt the role in its entirety. 💼
