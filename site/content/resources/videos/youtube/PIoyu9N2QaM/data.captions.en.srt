1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,599
so the question is what what is the

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,019
difference between a newbie scrum master

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:16,260
and a seasoned experienced scrum master

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,660
and I think it's their approach

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,520
right so so when you're when you're new

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,220
at something and you have lots of

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,660
choices on the way you approach a

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,539
problem

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,760
you're gonna pick away and try it right

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,740
you're gonna practice

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,140
and

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,420
the result of that

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,140
gives you a little bit more experience

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,200
right some XP points to to start

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,320
leveling up and figuring out what are

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,260
the things that you know work

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,059
better within a context

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,500
right because I guess it depends on the

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,420
context of the team that you're working

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,920
with the context of the organization and

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,260
if you shift those you might have to

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
relearn a lot of stuff again

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,300
but

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,380
the the the the

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,020
season scrum Master already has a bunch

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,420
of that knowledge and experience

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,400
and quite often those experienced scrum

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,680
Masters go off and you know write books

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,780
and blog posts and and do videos that

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,119
that the Newbie Scott Masters are going

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,680
to watch to try and get a leg up but

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,600
there's a difference between knowledge

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,820
which is what you're gaining that way

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,159
and the experience of how to use it

35
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,979
right because those those experienced

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,259
scrum Masters have seen

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,180
this is the practice that I I kind of

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,920
like that's my default right so I'm

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,320
going to default to this

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,600
but you know for this type of company

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,060
that's probably not the best way to do

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,860
it maybe I need to go to to want to try

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,020
one of these other practices because I

44
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,460
know already before I walk in the door

45
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,619
that this one's not going to work or

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,479
it's not going to work yet right I know

47
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,299
that I can get a group of a group of

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,939
people in a company to move towards this

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,740
thing by doing these little steps along

50
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,840
the way so I'm going to try each of

51
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,360
those steps yeah so I think the

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,580
fundamental difference is is iterative

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,679
and incremental right actually living

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,520
the scrum dream rather than just talking

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,660
about it I.E it's not a bullion value

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,940
proposition

57
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,920
using scrum in an organization it's not

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,739
a you're doing scrum you're not right

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,040
it's it's a it's a

60
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,379
you've got a journey to get from what

61
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,480
people aren't doing like where you want

62
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,000
them to get to and usually those things

63
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,160
are not they're doing a daily scrum

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,120
right who gives a crap about a daily

65
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,940
scrum right do they continuously and

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,340
transparently understand as a team where

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,920
they are on a daily basis right that's

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,260
what the value proposition we want over

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,239
here how are you going to get the team

70
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,400
towards that so that they understand

71
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,280
what's going on on a daily basis their

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,200
tactical daily daily situation what

73
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,959
about their their long-term strategic

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,780
right do they understand going forward

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,120
into the future over the next five or

76
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,040
six iterations that they're working on

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,660
or five or six things that they're

78
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,159
they're doing do they understand what

79
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,840
direction they're going right do they

80
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,580
understand the overall strategic

81
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,040
direction of the product

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,040
right if they don't understand those

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,680
things we need to bring in mechanisms to

84
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,080
help them get there and I think uh a

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,659
newbie scrum Master will go straight for

86
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,420
the for the end game oh we need a

87
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,879
product goal right well let's deploy a

88
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,860
product goal now that's fixed right and

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,900
they wonder why why it doesn't actually

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,120
change the way the team's working it

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,620
doesn't actually change the value

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,440
proposition that the organization's

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,200
getting but the the battle hardened

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,599
season scrum Master will know that if

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,180
you go straight for this it will become

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,860
mechanical nobody will get it they'll

97
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,680
just do it because they've been told to

98
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,959
do it not because they understand the

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,379
value of that thing therefore they want

100
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,379
to do it and want it to work well right

101
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,720
everybody in the team has to do has to

102
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,819
want to do it and want it to work well

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,400
in order for this thing to be successful

104
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,860
and this is true for whole companies as

105
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,879
well not just for a team right micro and

106
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,220
macro

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,760
so the seasoned experience scrum Master

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,380
is going to start

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,020
perhaps start with teaching the scrum

110
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,180
the scrum team basic some of the basic

111
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,580
concepts back to back to empiricism and

112
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,320
transparency and lean right are we

113
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,780
actually able to create those things

114
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,699
what does it mean if we don't have those

115
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,560
things let's look at the data for what

116
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,000
we're actually delivering and see where

117
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,120
the problems are and and lead the people

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,979
to their own conclusions which hopefully

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,979
positively impact those things and start

120
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,380
moving us towards that that goal and

121
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:54,900
that's where you start getting into more

122
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,500
coaching rather than Consulting right

123
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,960
because you you you're creating an

124
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,300
environment within which the person or

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,419
group of people are able to understand

126
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,340
and come up with their own answers

127
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,780
for the problems that we're trying to

128
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,600
solve in the situation we're trying to

129
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,699
get to whereas Consulting is a little

130
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,800
bit more the something we need to fix

131
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,660
something we need to a flip switch we

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,660
need to flip we've got to get that

133
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,300
changed quickly and then perhaps the

134
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,280
coaching kicks in later and because they

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,680
don't know how to do those things so I

136
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,300
think that that's uh the difference

137
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,660
between a newbie

138
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,940
scrum Master slash agile coach because

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,160
for me the same thing

140
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,940
um and the battle hardened scrum Master

141
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,940
at Angel coach
