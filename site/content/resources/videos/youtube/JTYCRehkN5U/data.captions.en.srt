1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,319
technical Excellence is one of the most

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:09,559
important Concepts When You're Building

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,599
Products uh scrum talks about this in

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,400
that um you're you should always have a

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,520
usable working product at the end of

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:24,400
every iteration um agile talks about

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,519
this um the idea is that in order to

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,560
mitigate risk we need to create usable

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,640
working product so in

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,559
the the the the more linear model right

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
where we know lots of stuff up front

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,360
let's say we were going to build three

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,239
300 houses on a on a construction site

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,239
um we know a lot up front we know

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,920
exactly what designs of the houses we're

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,719
going to have we've probably had to get

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,320
planning permission right so these

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,120
things a lot of that is locked in um for

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,879
what it is we're going to do so we know

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,000
how much materials how much wood how

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,480
much plaster we know when we're going to

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,280
do certain things on s or mostly when

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,600
right there's some variant but not a lot

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,479
of variants so when there's low variance

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,040
we mitigate Risk by doing more planning

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,000
right we we we we we plan up front we

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,000
create a bunch of documents around that

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,960
planning um we um create here's a list

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,119
of risks that might happen um if this

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,560
risk happens here's the mitigating

31
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,280
action we're going to have here's the

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,320
percentage likelihood that that risk is

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,399
going to happen um and we'll maintain

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,520
that data over time right so um we

35
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:42,000
create this whole body of material and

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,960
planning and dates and things around

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,840
that story and that's great when

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,880
variance is low um and that allows us to

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,119
mitigate the risk right because if

40
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,360
you're going to spend I don't know uh 20

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,200
million uh building

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,799
this area of houses um then then need to

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,640
plan for that but even even then you're

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:07,000
going to take a little bit of an agile

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,640
approach right you're not going to build

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,679
all the houses at once and then sell

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,239
them all at once you're going to build a

48
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,440
few houses and sell them and a few

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
houses and sell them because you're

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,959
testing the market and you're seeing and

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,040
you might then even need to apply for

52
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:20,680
different planning permission to change

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
your mind so there's still a lot of

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,640
variance in that story I do get that for

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,280
those that um are in that industry but

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,879
in general right old school you're

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,879
you're you're kind of making that those

58
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,920
decisions up

59
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,200
front but when we have high variants

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,519
which as I just noted can happen in the

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,879
building industry as well but when we

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,560
have high variants we um can't mitigate

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,720
Risk by writing everything down and

64
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,800
creating a story for every single thing

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,800
that might maybe happen because every

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,280
single thing that might maybe happen is

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,599
going to change every day right think of

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,319
the

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,720
the I like to I like to think of the the

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
the the Multiverse right you've got all

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,080
those decision points that happen and

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,560
every time you make a decision and go

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,319
down A New Path a whole different set of

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,959
decision points and problem points and

75
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,599
issue points occur so every time you

76
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,200
made one of those decisions every time

77
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,400
you made one of those little changes you

78
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,239
would need to rebuild all of that body

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,000
of asset and it's just not reasonable to

80
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,040
do that it puts too much of a um

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,480
overhead on uh uh people time everything

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,280
and you end up

83
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,040
with that story of the plan not being

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,200
able to the plan itself not being able

85
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,799
to keep up with the reality of the world

86
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,159
therefore we then make bad decisions

87
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,920
because we can't really see what's going

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,080
on and so we're not mitigating risk at

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,280
all

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,079
but in that high variance world we

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,239
mitigate Risk by creating a usable

92
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,079
working product on a regular Cadence

93
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,760
right that's how we mitigate the risk we

94
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:06,159
deliver something we create that thing

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,239
that the customer is looking for and we

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,680
offer it to them for inspection so they

97
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,480
can look at it and see yeah yeah yeah

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,840
you're doing the right thing or oh what

99
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,319
I don't understand why you made those

100
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,160
decisions great that's a great

101
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,120
conversation right so in order to be

102
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,479
able to have a usable working product at

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,320
the end of every iteration and I I do

104
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,160
want to point out this this is not a

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,600
pipe dream this is not a ideal World

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,840
thing um I I I want you to all go look

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,639
up um the

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,880
DI uh the US Department of Defense di

109
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,080
article on detecting agile [Â __Â ] um

110
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,120
it was an article that a paper that was

111
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,880
sent out to every procurement officer in

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,600
the the the I think it was the Air Force

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,320
um to let them know what they need to

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,520
look for

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
when they're working with vendors right

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,479
when they're buying stuff from

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
vendors so that they can make better

118
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,000
purchasing decisions this vendor is

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,120
telling me telling me that they're agile

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,080
how do I know that they're agile I'm a

121
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Layman I don't understand necessarily

122
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,160
understand agile I don't necessarily

123
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,280
understand that new world how do I

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,319
ensure that I'm buying the right thing

125
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,639
and this article lays out a whole bunch

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,360
of questions um that enable that person

127
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,720
to at least start getting some insight

128
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,319
and one of the key questions um and this

129
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,479
is like the first one for for for

130
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:44,120
leadership was um are H uh versions do

131
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,840
you have a working version of your

132
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,639
product every iteration including the

133
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,919
first that gets into the hands of real

134
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,919
users real users not uat not fake users

135
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,240
not test environments real

136
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,680
users every iteration including the

137
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,880
first

138
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,800
so if you're doing two we iterations um

139
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,680
then at the end of the first two weeks

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,880
you should have a usable working

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:18,039
product that's how we mitigate risk in

142
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,240
the agile and scrum space that's how we

143
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:24,639
ensure that um when people give us money

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,919
we're actually delivering something that

145
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,199
will be valuable for them right um and

146
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,720
that's really hard hard if our our our

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,720
software our product the quality of our

148
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,520
product is terrible that's that's really

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,919
hard can you can you imagine trying even

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,080
if you were building houses right uh and

151
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,039
um you're you're there's there's broken

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,160
broken joists there's things not

153
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,400
attached properly there's leaky pipes

154
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,800
there's flooding we've not built the

155
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,759
house properly and we're trying to hand

156
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,560
that house over to the customer and have

157
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,240
the customer come in and look at it and

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,960
the customer's like well this is this is

159
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,039
Terri what I'm not going to buy

160
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,879
this that that's where engineering

161
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,000
Excellence comes in that's where

162
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:14,560
technical Excellence comes in um we want

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,960
to build things that actually work we

164
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,120
want to deliver less stuff up front

165
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,520
right in the in the fictional you know

166
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,800
that old phrase um

167
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,039
20% so is it 80% of the work takes 20%

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
of the time and the last 20% takes 80%

169
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,800
of the time

170
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,080
that is because our quality was bad

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,639
that's because we didn't have technical

172
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,599
excellence in what it was that we were

173
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,800
doing so we got that 80% of the

174
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,080
functionality we've done it looks like

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,759
it works but actually behind the scenes

176
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,039
it's a total mess spaghetti absolute

177
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,159
garbage and the customer comes along and

178
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,720
tries to use it and they're like oh we

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,400
need to fix this we need to fix that and

180
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,479
you end up hatching right you're getting

181
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,120
out the sticky tape and super glue and

182
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,720
trying to figure out how do we patch

183
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,720
this together and then they're like oh I

184
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,960
don't like the way this works you can't

185
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,080
rebuild it because it's part of the

186
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,680
fundamental architecture so you have to

187
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,599
add another layer of uh OB Fusion on top

188
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,080
to make it look like it works the way

189
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,840
the customer wanted it to work but

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,039
actually behind the scenes it just works

191
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,680
the way the developers originally built

192
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:27,080
it to work and now we've got extra

193
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,159
complexity we've got something that is

194
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,159
more difficult to maintain more

195
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,880
difficult to understand and you can

196
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,800
imagine that over time that builds up on

197
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,640
top and you end up with massive amounts

198
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,680
of funking layers appar effectively that

199
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,640
um inhibit your ability to deliver value

200
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,640
and that's something that I I would I

201
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,440
would quantify um with some some

202
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,040
some data I do a lot of presentations on

203
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,640
how the Azure devops team that's the

204
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,839
team at Microsoft that built the Azure

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,560
devops product um they in 2012 they were

206
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,600
technically a waterfall team they were

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,000
delivering once every two years to

208
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
production and they moved almost

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,120
overnight towards uh uh continuous

210
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,240
delivery and uh uh 3- week iterations

211
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,760
right so they were delivering usable

212
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
working product every three weeks they

213
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,320
were shipping to production every 3

214
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,519
weeks um and they've delivered every 3

215
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,600
weeks for the past I don't know

216
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:35,279
26 3 week Sprints right um

217
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,839
so back in 2012 with 650 people they

218
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,320
were delivering around 24 features to

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,640
production each year and part of the

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,839
reason that that number is quite low 24

221
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:51,519
features is that one the features were

222
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:55,880
really big but also the

223
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,880
the difficulty in adding the

224
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,079
features and

225
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,120
interacting with the code base in order

226
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,600
to get the product to do the things that

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,640
you wanted it to do was really difficult

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,560
because you had all those little layers

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,839
of things that had built on top and this

230
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,839
doesn't quite work the way it was

231
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,279
supposed to I think aure devops was

232
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,959
originally team Foundation server if you

233
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,600
remember those days and team Foundation

234
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,440
server was originally a bunch of other

235
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,920
products that were Native inside of

236
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,920
Microsoft um they had Source control

237
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
uh in-house Source control products they

238
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,800
had in-house work item tracking products

239
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,920
they had in-house other stuff um and

240
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,639
that was kind of cooled together in

241
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,200
order to um create the first version of

242
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,480
Team Foundation server now I'm sure so

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
lots of stuff was Rewritten and but

244
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,680
you've got that

245
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,839
fundamental architectural mindset right

246
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,839
even though you're rewriting something

247
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,519
you you're you're taking something else

248
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,399
so actually the the the genetics of that

249
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,040
product is is is quite long quite old um

250
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,480
and then you get to that point where

251
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,120
you're switching

252
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,920
from needing two years to get a piece of

253
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,920
functionality working

254
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,360
um to needed three weeks to get a piece

255
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,839
of functionality

256
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,800
working so they moved to this new model

257
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,720
and in uh 2012 they're delivering about

258
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,720
24 features to production um they then

259
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
focused

260
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,800
absolutely the majority of their

261
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,639
time maybe going majority is probably

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,360
too much their primary focus was on um

263
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:47,200
paying back technical debt building in

264
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,839
technical Excellence solving those

265
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Effectiveness problems right of of

266
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,920
moving to that new model both in both in

267
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,920
their process and in in the product as

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,120
well and by 2018 they were delivering

269
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,160
280 features to production each year

270
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
with with the same number of people so

271
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,040
from 24 features to production 24

272
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
experiments 24 new features to try and

273
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,360
see if the customer likes to

274
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,160
280 new features the customer

275
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,880
experiments to try things that might

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,440
work and might help the customer now yes

277
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,120
those things were smaller right um but

278
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,199
they were also delivered

279
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,360
faster um

280
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:29,240
and that focus on technical Excellence

281
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,880
enables us to do that um if we don't

282
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,399
have technical excellence in the way we

283
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,279
do things then it just doesn't work I I

284
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,880
did a recent interview with Dan Helm who

285
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:40,800
was who is the the he runs as your

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
boards the work item tracking part of

287
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,600
the part of the

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:49,399
system and when uh he was quizzed on

289
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,079
definition of done and how that works he

290
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,920
didn't really have a solid answer and

291
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:58,760
that's because technical Excellence is

292
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,399
so baked into the way they do everything

293
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,680
at that level like all the engineers

294
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,040
know what it is they need to do what

295
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,959
level of quality is required um they

296
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:15,199
know um all of those all of those

297
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,959
things that they don't need to um they

298
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,000
don't need to focus on it right it's

299
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,040
just the way they do Business technical

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,199
Excellence engineering quality is just

301
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,279
the norm it's not an exception which

302
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,279
means that they can then focus on on

303
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,600
delivering value to the customer they've

304
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,440
reduced risk and they can focus on

305
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,440
delivering value they can focus on those

306
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,160
other things that's what technical

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,320
Excellence brings for um a product for

308
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,399
product management for product

309
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,880
leadership is the ability for them to

310
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,800
stop focusing on fighting fires on

311
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,639
fixing bugs on struggling with

312
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,360
complexity on being frustrated that they

313
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,839
can't get certain features done because

314
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,680
it's just too hard to do within the

315
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,880
architecture of the product and you

316
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,079
start focusing on the art of the

317
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,320
possible what is it we can do where are

318
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,240
we going what are we trying to achieve

319
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,320
you can then let go of those things

320
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,560
because you're no longer having to ride

321
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,560
that

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,040
quality that's a terrible analogy but

323
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
you're no longer having to to hold on

324
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,759
for dear life uh while this product

325
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,160
bucks around um you're you're you're

326
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,000
you're now in the in in the groove it's

327
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,839
smooth it's we're adding features we're

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,720
building capabilities we're we're we're

329
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,120
building an awesome product and that

330
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,320
that's part of that that that story of

331
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:39,880
mitigating risk building te technical

332
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,720
Excellence there's a myth as well

333
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,639
there's a huge myth in the software

334
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,399
industry that it's okay to sacrifice

335
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,680
some quality in order to go faster and

336
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,480
meet the market need um there's a recent

337
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,320
article I think it was a har Business

338
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,199
review article it might not have been

339
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,040
but it might have been a Forbes article

340
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:07,040
um but there's some studies done around

341
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,040
that idea of and what happens when we

342
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,800
cut quality in order to go faster right

343
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,839
and what's the trade-offs involved in

344
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:20,680
that and the ultimate outcome was that

345
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:24,079
it it it's not a valid tradeoff you have

346
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,639
M the the the impact of that reduction

347
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,600
in quality is much higher than the

348
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:34,000
benefit you get from being able to go

349
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,800
fast over the short term um so that a

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,480
cruel cuz a cruel of let's call let's

351
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,880
let's call it two things there's undone

352
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,240
work stuff that you need to do in order

353
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,279
for your product to run in production

354
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,959
that hasn't been done yet right that's

355
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,079
that 8020 thing that's where that pit

356
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,000
comes from and then there's technical

357
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,399
debt which is

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,440
shortcuts that deliberate shortcuts that

359
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,360
we make in order uh um that we do things

360
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,880
in a suboptimal way within the product

361
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,839
that's technical debt right um so both

362
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,759
of those things added together don't

363
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
acre linearly right it's an exponential

364
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,600
acre and that's where that Azure devops

365
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
team was at the start they were at the

366
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,120
top of that exponential curve only

367
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,120
delivering 24 features to production

368
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,680
each year but in focusing

369
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:34,519
almost H um

370
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,880
religiously Zealot like on paying back

371
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,440
that technical debt of getting rid of

372
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,079
all of that undone work and bringing

373
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,600
that curve back down to a manageable

374
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:49,199
level right and Beyond get it towards

375
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,839
trending towards zero right we want to

376
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,920
have as high quality effective a product

377
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,440
as possible they they actually in one

378
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,360
year nearly tripled the number of

379
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,120
features delivered to production even

380
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,760
though their main focus was on let's do

381
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,319
it right let's pay back the technical

382
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,400
debt they actually delivered more stuff

383
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:16,679
so that goes go reduced quality to go

384
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,480
fast is a losing prop proposition it

385
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,319
always has been a losing proposition

386
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,000
definitely do that what you want to do

387
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,640
is focus on technical Excellence if you

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,880
don't have a definition of done create

389
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,760
one if

390
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,799
your

391
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,600
organization doesn't have a definition

392
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,960
of done which it should your

393
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,640
organization um should be thinking about

394
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,440
from a technical Excellence perspective

395
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,080
what is the minimum level of quality we

396
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,840
as a business

397
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:53,160
require in order to have a product that

398
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,000
is fit for Mar fit for purpose right um

399
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,360
protects our brand our business as a

400
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,799
whole this product is representing our

401
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,880
brand or is or or or however that works

402
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,919
representing your brand um protecting

403
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,320
the people that are using it and

404
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:12,320
protecting like uh the the the um uh

405
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,080
post office scandal in the UK right

406
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
protecting the people that are using it

407
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,360
protecting your employees and your

408
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,559
developers right to make sure that

409
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,480
there's there that everything's done

410
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,200
right that right you don't want um like

411
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,320
think about boing right the reduction in

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,960
quality is just now seeping out um and

413
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,919
what what else do you need in order to

414
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,960
have a viable product in your Market in

415
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,240
your situation right so different levels

416
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,640
for different markets that's the

417
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,280
business's requirement for done and

418
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,799
we're not talking about feature there's

419
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,960
there's a big

420
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:54,840
um conflation I think

421
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,799
between features being feature complete

422
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,159
and quality engineering Excellence is

423
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,440
about quality it's not about having the

424
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,760
features right so let's take that put

425
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,280
that aside the what we're building we're

426
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,240
going to take that aside and we're going

427
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,520
to focus on the how we're building it do

428
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,720
we have the level of quality required to

429
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,799
meet compliance do we have the level of

430
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,360
quality required um to meet the the the

431
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,000
the the testing level that we we want do

432
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,080
we have the amount of telemetry in there

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,280
to see what's going on all of those

434
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,799
things are part of that that definition

435
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,440
of done which has nothing to do with the

436
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:33,679
features on only focusing on the quality

437
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,360
of the product um and that enshrines

438
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,640
your engineering Excellence so if the

439
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,679
organization doesn't have that standard

440
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,280
um it's the developers the scrum team

441
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,240
that or the developers that are charged

442
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,600
with creating one that is relevant for

443
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,240
your product um and significant enough

444
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
that you're going to be able to create a

445
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,799
usable working product every Sprint and

446
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,960
the reason you have a more usable

447
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,000
working product is to mitigate that risk

448
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,600
and um build out your engineering

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,720
Excellence so don't get left behind

450
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,679
don't get bugged down in the Quagmire of

451
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,039
engineering inferiority focus on

452
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,679
engineering Excellence build the best

453
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,799
product you can and maximize the value

454
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,799
to your customers
