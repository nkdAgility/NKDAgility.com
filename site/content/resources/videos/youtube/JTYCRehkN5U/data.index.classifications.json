    "reasoning": "The content focuses on technical excellence, the definition of Done, reducing technical debt, and Agile delivery practices, especially using the Azure DevOps case. It aligns with modern software engineering but lacks any explicit or substantive reference to autonomous AI agents, agentic principles, contextual intelligence, or autonomous agency. While there are analogies to improving systems of work and continuous delivery, none of the key topics (AI agents, agency, human-agent synergy, governance of agentic systems) are discussed, either directly or indirectly. The intended audience (Agile/DevOps teams) somewhat overlaps with the category's target, but the substance does not demonstrate conceptual or practical application of agentic software delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content covers technical excellence in Agile/DevOps and modern delivery but does not reference agentic principles or AI autonomy, so it does not fit the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category beyond possible distant relevance.",
    "level": "Ignored"
