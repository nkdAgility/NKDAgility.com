world of difference to an organisation: \"When is the right time to bring in a professional Agile consultant?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-low-point-failure-can-be-an-opportunity\">The Low Point: Failure Can Be an Opportunity</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I'll never forget what the renowned Ken Schwaber taught me: the simple yet heartbreaking answer to this question is when an organisation has almost unimaginably failed to deliver or be successful in whatever endeavour they're trying to achieve.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-facing-unimaginable-failure-an-opportunity-to-change\">Facing Unimaginable Failure: An Opportunity to Change!</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>From my experience as an Agile Coach, it is at this very moment, when an organisation is reeling from failure, that they are most open to change. üö©</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Suddenly, with failure staring them in the face, there is undoubtedly a collective realisation, which is the same: \"We need something different. &nbsp;We need to try something different and something new.\" üîÑ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You might find what I'm about to say interesting.&nbsp; But I actually know of a company that switches to Scrum and Agile when a project is in jeopardy and then reverts to Waterfall when it's over.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now, don't you find that unproductive and plain bizarre?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>While this approach is highly unorthodox, the failure to deliver creates a desire and need for almost palpable change.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But here's the kicker - the failure to deliver stirs up a potent desire for change.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So like me and the organisation, you're probably saying that this is the best time to bring in a professional to help. üí°</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-beware-the-agile-sales-pitch\">Beware the Agile Sales Pitch</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This is the point where I have to stress caution.&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Organisations should always be aware of the many silver-tongued salespeople out there.&nbsp; üíº</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At such critical junctures, when desperation for help sets in, organisations need to wait and be patient and cautious.&nbsp; However, in my years, I've seen organisations often turn to large consulting companies who, while they might talk a good game, don't necessarily understand Agile.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It's a pitfall of being \"won over by fast-talking PowerPoint presentation gurus that can talk a good game but can't actually deliver.\" Hence, it's crucial to find the right Agile expertise; this is where a professional Agile consultant comes in.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Companies are often swayed by fast-talking PowerPoint gurus who, despite their eloquence, may not actually be capable of delivery.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>An organisation needs to find the right Agile, which is why a professional Agile consultant is key. üóùÔ∏è</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-question-that-always-matters-can-we-be-better\">The Question That Always Matters: Can We Be Better?</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As you probably know by now, my answer is a solid 'yes'.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As an Agile Consultant, I always encourage a high point and continuous improvement, so I have another answer to this article's question, another side to this coin, of 'when should an organisation consider a professional Agile Consultant,' which is \"any time is the right time!\"</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Perhaps your organisation is achieving its goals and you wonder, \"Could we be better?\"</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Sometimes, having an outsider review your operations and produce a \"state of Agile\" or \"state of DevOps\" report can provide a fresh perspective. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I've done this a lot, interviewing people in the organisation, right up through the leadership and even the customers, to create a roadmap for the organisation's next big thing. üíº</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-outside-in-perspective-an-agile-gamechanger\">The Outside-in Perspective: An Agile Gamechanger</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I think that there's always so much power from an external perspective. üëÄ It's one of the main benefits of a professional Agile consultant is the \"outside-in\" perspective.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Often, it takes an outsider's perspective to recognise problems or identify growth opportunities. &nbsp;When we're \"in the jar looking out,\" it can be tough to see what our own problems are. üëÄ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, consider bringing in a professional Agile consultant whether you're struggling or feeling under the weight of a failed project or performing well but wondering if there's room for improvement. üß≠</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Join us for our next Agile Practitioner Series course, where we'll delve into these topics and more! üíº</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Naked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you are interested in #agiletraining, visit <a href=\"https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/\">https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit <a href=\"https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/agile-consulting-coaching/\">https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/agile-consulting-coaching/</a></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We would love to work with you.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Keywords: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
