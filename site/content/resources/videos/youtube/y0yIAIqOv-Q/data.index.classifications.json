    "reasoning": "The content discusses the role of agile consultants in relation to Scrum, particularly in the context of organisations transitioning between methodologies. It mentions Scrum explicitly and touches on its application during project failures. However, the discussion is more focused on the broader concept of agile consulting rather than a deep dive into Scrum principles, roles, or events, which limits the depth of the discussion.",
