The shift from #projectmanagement to #productdevelopment can be dramatic and intimidating. There are values and principles rather than rules, and a lightweight #agileframework is providing you with guardrails rather than telling you exactly what to do and when to do it.

It's great for #productdevelopment teams, but if you aren't used to working creatively and collaboratively with others, it can feel tough to know where to start and how to improve from there?

So, at what point do you bring an #agileconsultant onboard? Do you do it at the very beginning when you are still deciding on a solution or do you bring them onboard once the team is up and running?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about appropriate times to engage an #agileconsultant in your organization.
