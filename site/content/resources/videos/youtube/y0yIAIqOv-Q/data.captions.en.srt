1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,200
when should an organization consider a

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,360
professional agile consultant that's

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,599
that's an uh

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,580
so the easy answer

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,779
is is is

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,300
when when they've just

7
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,039
most unimaginably failed to deliver or

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,019
failed to be successful and would have

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,599
unfailed to be successful in whatever

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:35,460
Endeavor they're trying to achieve

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,920
because I actually learned this from Ken

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,280
um at that moment when

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,660
an organization is reeling from that

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,960
failure

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,420
they are most open to change

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,520
they are most open to doing something

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,340
different we we need something different

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,379
we need to try something new

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,960
um as this backfired on occasion I do

20
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,660
know of a company that only uses scrum

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,520
and agile when a project is in Jeopardy

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,140
and then falls back to Waterfall so they

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,939
run all these projects waterfall and

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,260
then near the end of the project they

25
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,640
have to switch to scrum to actually

26
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,320
deliver it and then they switch back

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,840
again which is totally weird but that's

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,159
how they how they do things but that

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,780
that

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,780
that failure to deliver

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,180
creates that desire and need for change

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,520
so that's that's probably the best time

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,860
to bring in somebody to help

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,540
unfortunately

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,119
there's an unfortunately there as well

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,780
is that that quite often companies turn

37
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,920
to really large Consulting companies

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,880
who don't although they talk a good talk

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,939
don't necessarily actually understand

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,960
standard they don't really understand it

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,479
um you you companies are won over by uh

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,079
fast talking PowerPoint presentation

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,240
gurus that are able to to to talk a good

44
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,060
game but can actually deliver

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,619
and so that that's that's the risk at

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,259
that moment right because they're

47
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,959
they're desperate for for help

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,459
um and then they're they're they'll take

49
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,480
whatever whatever's on offer and there's

50
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,459
not always the right thing they're gonna

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,959
find the right agile which is why I

52
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,280
guess you said professional agile

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,200
consultant right you've got to get that

54
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,520
professional one in there

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,140
um

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
but I think that that that's probably

57
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,900
the the key time to get get them in but

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,720
really the other answer is anytime

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,940
any any time maybe maybe you're being

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,400
really successful and you wonder

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,840
could we be better

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,660
um sometimes having somebody come in

63
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
from the outside and look at what it is

64
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,840
that you're doing and something that

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,959
I've done a whole bunch with

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,019
organizations is kind of like a

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,379
I guess I would call it a state of agile

68
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,860
report or a state of devops report

69
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,500
where I come in and I interview a whole

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,420
bunch of people in the organization

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,300
generally solo but sometimes in teams

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,739
and just ask them how they're doing how

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,120
do they you know what's their Cadence

74
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,340
for delivery how often do you have

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,019
working products and asking all the way

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,700
up through through the organization and

77
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,260
into leadership as well and hopefully

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,420
you can get a hold of some customers too

79
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,640
right because they always have good uh

80
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,680
good stories to tell

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,080
and create

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,360
that that like what's the next big thing

83
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,580
that this organization should tackle and

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,780
I don't think that often comes from the

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,280
inside without a little bit of outside

86
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,959
injection of knowledge or a different

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,459
way of thinking or a different way of

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
looking at the problem because we're

89
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,080
when we're in the jar looking out right

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,420
it's difficult to kind of see what our

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,720
what our own problem is

92
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,780
um so yeah both both when you're when

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,599
you're totally hosed and uh when you're

94
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,760
not right so pretty much anytime

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,200
hmm

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
