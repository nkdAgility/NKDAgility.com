1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,360
so I first encountered devops as a as a

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,920
developer at Marl Lynch but I experience

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,799
the frustration that created the need

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,279
for

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,480
devops um in many jobs beforehand um I

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,400
started my career uh back in the early

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,199
ughs 2001 um and I was working for what

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,240
was then called New Media agencies which

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,920
are just web development companies these

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,239
days building

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,000
websites and we did all the things you

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,480
shouldn't be doing we deployed from our

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,640
local machine we edited in production um

14
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,600
we did all of those crazy nasty things

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,320
because at the at the time continuous

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,600
integration wasn't really a thing oh it

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
was round right at that time in 2001 I

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,199
think continuous integration had been

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,280
around for about nine years but most

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,159
most people hadn't really heard of it

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,680
most people weren't really doing it

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,360
around then uh you'll your experience

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,400
will absolutely vary there'll be lots of

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,240
people that that that were doing it um

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,200
and I experienced the frustration of

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,880
mistakes of deployments that failed of

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,640
overwriting things you shouldn't be

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,840
overwriting all of those kind of things

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,759
and when we when I moved to Mar Lynch uh

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,520
which is a big uh Investment Banking

31
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,119
Company the r tools were different right

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,759
you you didn't have access to production

33
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,399
um once it's production you only had

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,479
access to spe specific environments you

35
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,079
had to have specific deployment packages

36
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,119
you couldn't make changes to certain

37
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,960
types of systems like SQL Server you had

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,759
to give them uh a patch to be able to

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,040
apply

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,479
and when you're in those restrictions

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,640
and you try and do the same thing that

42
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,280
you were doing before cuz when I arrived

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,320
at the part of Maryland that I was

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,200
working at they didn't have any

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,680
automation they didn't have any have any

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,759
of these things you experience even

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,160
worse frustration because you give

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:15,319
somebody um who has doesn't care one jot

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,160
about your product uh some DBA in I

50
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,360
don't know where they were I know that

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Marl Lynch had five and a half thousand

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,120
dbas in the organization who you would

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,879
give scripts to and they would go run it

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,680
against the databases and nobody else

55
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,440
was allowed to to go near the databases

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
um but it meant that that you would give

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,360
them it it would take them a half day to

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,519
get to it and they would tell you that

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,959
the script didn't work and then you

60
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,280
would have to go tweak the script and

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,959
give it to them tweak the script and

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,319
give it to them and it would just be a

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,159
nightmare and it would take ages to get

64
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,640
anything deployed so what what what we

65
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:56,640
started doing was thinking about how we

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:00,519
could do automation how we could create

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,319
a more slick process where at the very

68
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,599
least we were able to get into

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,040
production with with less hiccups there

70
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:10,760
wasn't a lot of devops going on back

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,200
then um it was called application life

72
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,280
cycle management and application life

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,840
cycle management was both good ways of

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
doing things and bad ways of doing

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,959
things but just under that guise of

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,959
we're going to be actively managing

77
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,239
these

78
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,599
applications um it's the term that then

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,120
morphed into devops a little bit later

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:33,120
on once once devops was coined so what

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,799
what what we did was we introduced tools

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,599
we introduced ways of doing things we

83
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,879
introduced automation to our story and I

84
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,799
started using at the time team

85
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,599
Foundation server um as part of that

86
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,560
integration automation uh everything

87
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,319
linked together traceability story for

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,920
application life cycle management we

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,640
made it a little bit more

90
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,879
professional um but while that was my

91
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,079
kind of baptism into that very different

92
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
environment where there's a lot of

93
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,360
controls we still didn't didn't do it

94
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:13,040
very well and it really wasn't until I

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,920
started working more heavily in the team

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
Foundation server

97
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:22,680
community and I became a Microsoft

98
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,160
MVP that I started engaging with other

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,639
people who were in that category and

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,520
really working towards making things

101
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,680
more effective that we started talking

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,919
about about how we could do the

103
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,840
automation how we could enable getting

104
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,280
from code all the way to production

105
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,520
without having people in the way uh uh

106
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,520
messing things up or other stories in

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,360
the way um getting in you know other

108
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,759
bias in the way getting in in the way of

109
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,520
the the thing you're trying to deploy um

110
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:56,639
and that was really my my introduction

111
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,400
into into proper proper it's probably

112
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,039
not the right better devops was as a

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,840
Microsoft um application life cycle

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,680
management MVP uh working with

115
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:16,080
other Alm MVPs within that category to

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,120
really really focus on on that story and

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,319
I found that I was I seem to have an

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,000
affinity for that an affinity for

119
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,800
engaging with uh development teams and

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,120
helping them get better um at that

121
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,600
continuous delivery continuous

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,360
integration tools tools are not

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,680
all of devops tools support devops but

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,240
they're definitely a common route into

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,720
towards devops cuz most I I I really

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,600
think of um devops as the other side of

127
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:53,000
the agile coin um

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,360
I.E agile was something that was created

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,319
but some people who were definitely

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Engineers you think of the signatur

131
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,840
theago manifesto but they were also

132
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,800
much higher level Engineers they were

133
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,960
they were managers and they were uh

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,400
working on big products and projects so

135
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
they weren't just a software engineer

136
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,919
building products it was a much bigger

137
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:22,080
thing and they really um thought of came

138
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,960
up with with this idea of agile from the

139
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,759
that

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,680
perspective and some things seem to be a

141
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,280
little bit missing that were only

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,240
implied in the agile Manifesto but

143
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,800
weren't actually explicitly this is this

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,680
is the thing you need to worry about and

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,360
that for me this is how I feel about it

146
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,759
I think that's why devops uh was born

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,280
that's why application life cycle

148
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,919
management became devops is because we

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,160
really wanted folks from the engineering

150
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,479
perspective were trying to get to the

151
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,639
same thing that the folks from the agile

152
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,199
Manifesto perspective were trying to get

153
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,080
to as well um and that engineering Focus

154
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,639
means that that there's a lot more

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,199
Reliance engagement and support on on

156
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:13,800
tools on processes on systems cuz that's

157
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:17,160
how um core engineering folks kind of

158
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,759
think um and that that story kind of

159
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,039
culminated in me uh um co- co-authoring

160
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,319
a book for rocks called one of the big

161
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,240
red books um engineering books called

162
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,840
professional application life cycle

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,199
manag management with visual studio

164
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,319
20133 and that kind of solidified my my

165
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,919
progress towards um supporting that that

166
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,160
that that story and kind of I don't

167
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,479
remember when it came about it might

168
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,000
have been around that time it might have

169
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,440
been a little bit later um but a great

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
uh devops person called Donovan Brown um

171
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,319
who did eventually work for Microsoft um

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,800
came up with a definition of devops that

173
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,400
I think um makes the most makes the most

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,199
sense it's a little bit tools focused

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,479
but not as well um and I I quite like it

176
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,639
it's devops is the union of people

177
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,520
processes and products to enable

178
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,879
continuous delivery of value to our end

179
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,039
users so when you think about where

180
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,720
devops came from application life cycle

181
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,599
management the engineering side of

182
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,159
delivering products and that move

183
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,520
towards realizing and this was a big

184
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:35,000
realization for me as well with is that

185
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:39,200
um people uh sorry let me rephrase that

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,240
tools don't solve problems people do

187
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
right and people with folks like myself

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,800
with an engineering Focus very much

189
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,920
focus on the tools and the code and the

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,240
engineering and we sometimes forget that

191
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,040
the people are in the way not in the way

192
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,680
the people are part of the story as well

193
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,920
right and um we need to bring the people

194
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,399
and the processes and the products

195
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,160
together to create our system that

196
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,519
allows us to to to build effectively

197
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,560
build uh uh products and continuously

198
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:17,519
deliver products to to our end users so

199
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,760
there are kind of three primary

200
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,760
challenges in that story of of of of

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,200
devops um which is what I experienced as

202
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,160
I moved through them myself and I think

203
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,880
the the best way to experience them is

204
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,600
to move through them yourself right um

205
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,800
we we learn by doing um and the first

206
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,200
one is that that um culture and

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,279
collaboration shift if you think of the

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,079
agile Manifesto people and interactions

209
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,560
are more valuable than processes and

210
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:50,440
tools and that's absolutely true even on

211
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,680
the on the devop side but devops to a

212
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:58,480
much greater degree acknowledges that um

213
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,160
processes and tools support the people

214
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,839
in doing the things that that that that

215
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,880
we need to do um I keep I keep thinking

216
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,800
of the the um the night night Capital

217
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,320
group right that story about the the the

218
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,600
in I think they were an investment firm

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,880
um listed on the New York Stock Exchange

220
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,240
$450 million cash in the bank uh to

221
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
support their business um and they had

222
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,519
they had have failed deployment because

223
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,000
they were manually deploying they had

224
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,320
poor quality code they had a a poor

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,120
quality deployment with just one person

226
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,920
and something went wrong that they

227
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,079
couldn't figure out um and they started

228
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
hemorrhaging money the moment they did

229
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,959
their deployment and ended up they

230
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
managed by the end of the day they

231
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,399
managed to figure out what the problem

232
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,959
was with their deployment and and fixed

233
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,000
production but by then it was too late

234
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,880
they' drained their Capital reserves

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,880
they didn't have any cash flow anymore

236
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,720
and they had to file for for bankruptcy

237
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,399
um and the reason we know so much about

238
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,600
why they failed is because the

239
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,600
bankruptcy filing has to list why

240
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,560
they're going into bankruptcy and it

241
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,040
detailed the problems that they' they'd

242
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,680
figured out they ran into right um

243
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,880
they'd been reusing code that they

244
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
thought wasn't used for anything they'd

245
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,839
uh not been focusing on their

246
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
architectures and and building up

247
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,320
software quality and they had one person

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,959
doing the deployment with no backup or

249
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,800
support to validate what it was that

250
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,839
they were doing and the person

251
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,240
accidentally deployed to seven out of

252
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,880
the eight servers that they were

253
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,040
deploying to that's roughly the story um

254
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,519
so that that cultural

255
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,360
shift on the people side of getting

256
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,000
people on board with this idea that

257
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,680
while tools and processes don't solve

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,560
your problems they're there to serve the

259
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,240
people's needs um and enable them to

260
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,240
to make things that are really

261
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,279
complicated and difficult like deploying

262
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,279
software can often be really complicated

263
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,399
and different I I build and maintain a

264
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,120
product still and I think there's 20

265
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,040
steps in building the product and maybe

266
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,639
five or six steps in deploying the

267
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,399
product and they all have to be done

268
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,839
correctly in order for the output to

269
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,639
work I I don't want to have to walk

270
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,320
through that list every time Not only

271
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,360
would it be time consuming but I'm

272
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,600
likely to miss stuff I'm likely to have

273
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,279
my eyes go from step two to step four

274
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,800
instead of 1 2 3 right that happens all

275
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,959
the time I did training years ago for

276
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,839
for a bunch of testers um and I had made

277
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,560
the assumption that if anybody in the

278
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,920
world was able to follow a set of steps

279
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,079
that they' created you know to to to

280
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,079
validate that uh thing happens the the

281
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,279
correct way it it would be people who

282
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,160
were trained as testers but as it

283
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,480
happens that was not true we had Labs

284
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,079
that they were doing in this training

285
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,920
against a devops um and they would

286
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:02,000
constantly go wow this isn't working I

287
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,720
can't this doesn't work this is broken

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,199
your lab's wrong when in fact they

289
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,839
missed a step right so it's it's even

290
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,040
professionals whose job it is to follow

291
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,360
those steps when you're running things

292
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,000
manually also miss those steps it's just

293
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,680
the way the human brain works it's the

294
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,639
way things happen we're not going to be

295
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,839
able to fix it by focusing on the people

296
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,240
but we can build automation to help

297
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,240
support that cultural shift but people

298
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,040
have to accept that the the the people

299
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,880
that are part of your organization have

300
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,120
to accept that that automation is the

301
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,399
key that Automation in defining those

302
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,680
processes is the key to supporting that

303
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,720
story lots of organizations still

304
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,440
prevent us from being able to deploy

305
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,680
directly to production using automation

306
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,839
right from what we ideally want to do is

307
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,399
go from developer checks a line of code

308
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,639
into Source control right it ends up in

309
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
in our Deployable Branch whatever that

310
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
is uh we wanted to go from there all the

311
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,279
way to production and rolled out to

312
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,000
everybody without any human intervention

313
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,959
because that's our production line right

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,519
the the the the the the key shift here

315
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,279
is from development to delivery right

316
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,720
that's been you think about the way the

317
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,920
way car companies build cars they've

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,839
they've and Toyota kind of pioneered

319
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,759
this Toyota pioneered the ability to

320
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,680
deliver cars they're taking something

321
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,440
that they've designed and created and

322
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,600
that they works and delivering lots of

323
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,600
it into production that's their

324
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,399
production line right and we can apply

325
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,320
those those ideas and and and

326
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,040
mentalities to our our devops production

327
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,480
line which is from we've created the

328
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,800
thing and we validated that it works all

329
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
the way through and we can actually do

330
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,639
the validation as part of that right but

331
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,759
all the way through to to to get again

332
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,120
in the hands of real users that's that

333
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:59,720
not only that culture shift but also the

334
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,240
the the tool chain integration and

335
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:06,040
automation that needs to happen in order

336
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,480
for for that to work um and once you've

337
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,560
got that tool chain and Automation in

338
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,240
place right where we're able to do this

339
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,920
thing we then need to figure out how to

340
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,160
do it better how do we optimize that

341
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,079
production line to make it more

342
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,160
effective the the the the story I always

343
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,120
think about is um the the Azure devops

344
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,959
team right when they were the TFS team

345
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,319
and they were moving towards uh

346
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,959
continuous delivery from their waterfall

347
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:37,160
uh mindset um the the the the head of

348
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,399
that group Brian Harry at the time

349
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,880
decided to run a little test right so

350
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,680
they' they'd uh they were creating a

351
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,639
version of their product and they had

352
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,319
shipped their product all the way to to

353
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,920
production so it had gone through the

354
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:59,160
gauntlet of lawyers and validation and

355
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,040
uh um um signing and all of the the the

356
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,680
the gobbin that has to happen in between

357
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,040
so that it took them like I don't know

358
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,519
10 weeks 20 weeks whatever it was to be

359
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,160
able to to to get their product to a

360
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,720
state where it would pass the entire

361
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Gauntlet that it had to go through and

362
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,199
then they had a Deployable version so he

363
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,120
called it a null build there's no

364
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
changes to the code base we're just

365
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
doing the same thing again and how long

366
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,600
does it take to go through the process

367
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,759
so you know upfront every one of those

368
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:33,639
checks so they had a concerted effort to

369
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,680
look at their tool chain right to look

370
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:39,560
at how they did uh the build and process

371
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,160
and what of these checks could they

372
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,560
automate into the process so that they

373
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,399
can then just give the artifacts and

374
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,000
they sign them off or even if we have

375
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,480
those artifacts and we pass these checks

376
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,279
will you automate that sign off right

377
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,279
will you as the person who has to sign

378
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,600
off over here just say I'm happy if if

379
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
you followed this process I'm happy it

380
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,920
all worked all I was doing before was

381
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,760
checking that you'd followed the process

382
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,520
manually if you can automate that I'm

383
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,120
good to go and work through that story

384
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,720
inside of the organization of convincing

385
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,160
all of those different people and the

386
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,720
build started to chunk down to a much

387
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,079
smaller capability and I think they got

388
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,039
it down that way to 48 Hours was their

389
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,919
their their automated Pipeline and then

390
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,600
they started thinking about the advanced

391
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,039
stuff right if your biggest problem is

392
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,559
going from 8 weeks to 48 Hours focus on

393
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,120
that story right getting all the

394
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,039
approvals getting all the engage bring

395
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,559
it down right now you're at this 48

396
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,039
Hours what's the next biggest thing we

397
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,320
need to do deal with that's part of that

398
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,120
cultural shift right not only have we

399
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,799
got the tool chain involved but we've

400
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,200
got that cultural shift of what's the

401
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,799
biggest problem what's the most length

402
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,120
of time that our process is taking and

403
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,240
how can we how can we make it shorter

404
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,840
and engage in that story so um then you

405
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,240
start thinking about more advanced stuff

406
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,760
like our Advanced Automation and

407
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,240
orchestration right the next thing that

408
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,240
particular team focused on was why does

409
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,480
it take 48 hours to run our tests well

410
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,760
we need the whole system up we need to

411
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,679
feed it with test data and then we're

412
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,200
orchestrating across the entire system

413
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,200
uh to do those tests is there a

414
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,640
different way perhaps we can convert all

415
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,880
those long running tests that need data

416
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,520
loaded and all maybe we can convert as

417
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,320
many of them to unit tests as possible

418
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,159
so they worked for another four years

419
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,400
getting rid of flipping that pyramid

420
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,280
right from having most of their tests

421
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,360
being the long running Auto Automation

422
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,080
and a few unit tests flipping that

423
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,440
pyramid until in fact after four years

424
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,960
all of their tests were unit tests and

425
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,360
they got that 48 Hours down to three and

426
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
a half minutes right so that's three and

427
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,559
a half minutes for a developer to

428
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,320
validate um that the product that they

429
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,600
just made changes to still works the way

430
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,559
it's intended to work that's that's a

431
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,080
total GameChanger for organizations

432
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,039
think about if you make a change and you

433
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,640
don't know for 48 hours whether it was

434
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,640
the right change or not or it worked or

435
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,240
not do you work on other stuff and

436
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,600
perhaps introduce more breaking changes

437
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
or do you stop and wait for that result

438
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,799
and then continue on that delay is a

439
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,520
huge amount of waste in the system again

440
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:33,039
Le lean product delivery right you're

441
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,760
thinking about how you do that and then

442
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,520
once you do get there and you you're

443
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,120
you're confident you can get things into

444
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,919
production what about monitoring logging

445
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,880
and observability right are you able to

446
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,679
see what's going on in production are

447
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,840
you able to head off and find and Trace

448
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,520
issues before um they become customer

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,600
problems are you able to um go and find

450
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,799
out what happened when something goes

451
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,200
wrong do you have the transparency that

452
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,520
you need in your product that's a huge

453
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,280
part of that tool chain and automation

454
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,440
that it takes many many um months or

455
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,559
years of effort to get your product to a

456
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,320
state where you even have time to focus

457
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,080
on that stuff so monitoring and logging

458
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,280
is is is really important that's

459
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,760
Telemetry right how much Telemetry do

460
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,640
you get out of your system I I I I only

461
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,720
know the stats from about five years ago

462
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,559
but about five years ago Visual Studio

463
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:30,480
the big Visual Studio product visual

464
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,240
studio uh I guess it would be 2018

465
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,480
something like that 2017 whatever

466
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,080
version it was um was sending 7 and 12

467
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,600
terabytes of telemetry to Microsoft

468
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,840
every day right so that's Telemetry on

469
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,000
what features A's developers are using

470
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,760
how long the things that we're using

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,720
take how long it take to load what

472
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,400
buttons we click all of those things so

473
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,919
that they can build a better

474
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,880
product because then you start thinking

475
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,880
about well if we've got our Advanced

476
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,720
orchestration we've optimized our

477
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,120
pipeline we've also optimized we can see

478
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,600
what's going on because we've got

479
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,919
Telemetry and logging and we can

480
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,679
observe in almost real time what's

481
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:11,360
happening in the system then we can

482
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,120
start talking about optimizing um for

483
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,000
scalability and reliability right these

484
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,720
are all part of that devop story and

485
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,440
then there's the third thing so we had

486
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,480
cultural shift and collaboration um we

487
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,520
had toolchain integration and Automation

488
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,159
and the third thing is continuous

489
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,400
learning and skill Dev velopment none of

490
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,720
that stuff I just talked about comes

491
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,799
along overnight and none of that stuff

492
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,600
everybody already knows in your

493
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,480
organization and even if you start

494
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,360
hiring in people that have devop skills

495
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,320
eh what do they really know what do they

496
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,760
really understand we need to build these

497
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,880
skills inside of our organization don't

498
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,799
think you can buy devops and install it

499
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,039
right you can't just bring in a

500
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,799
Consulting organization tell them to

501
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,640
install devops in your organization and

502
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:07,840
expect that to be the outcome the people

503
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,640
in your organization have to have gone

504
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,120
through the Journey and had the Battle

505
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,919
Scars to understand why they do things

506
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,480
differently and they're then incumbent

507
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,320
in your organization in your

508
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,880
organization's culture and they're able

509
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,279
as new people come in

510
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,159
to reduce the number of scars that the

511
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,600
new people need inside of your

512
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,919
organization in order to get on the same

513
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,679
track does that make sense it's kind of

514
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,279
like um why why we train recruits right

515
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,120
going into going into military

516
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,159
organizations you train them so that

517
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,559
they don't make the mistakes that people

518
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,000
made in the past things that we already

519
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,960
understand aren't going to work out well

520
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,440
that's why we train them so that having

521
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,520
that incumbent knowledge in our

522
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,960
organization and then having people come

523
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,400
in and train and become part of that

524
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,279
organization and that culture in our

525
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,320
organization is really important to that

526
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:09,840
to that to that story so that that's

527
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,520
kind of where I where I I guess um

528
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:18,240
that's where I got got to over I guess

529
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,480
um six or seven years I guess maybe six

530
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,360
or seven years so from

531
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,799
2006 to

532
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,000
2013 um 2013's around when I did the the

533
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,880
application life cycle management

534
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,919
book um that that was that was my story

535
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,520
um to that to that point but

536
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:44,159
then when as you as you

537
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,720
learn as you learn new stuff sometimes

538
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,640
we do things because we're told to do

539
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,120
things and we don't know why we're doing

540
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,840
things and in order for True learning to

541
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,000
happen we have to understand the theory

542
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,400
that's actually why train training

543
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Theory training is so important

544
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,840
animportant inside of organizations

545
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,880
right because in order for the people in

546
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,919
your organization to have the Knowledge

547
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,640
and Skills to be able to make the best

548
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,159
decision in circumstances they've never

549
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,760
encountered before because we're doing

550
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,440
complex cognitive work we need to

551
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,000
understand the theory of why those

552
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:24,240
things are true so things like Little's

553
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,399
law and the theory of constraints and um

554
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,919
those are things that are part of that

555
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:33,720
the lean story that if we understand

556
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:37,240
those underlying Theory and Concepts we

557
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,200
can start doing stuff and learning right

558
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,320
we we feed that learning Loop through

559
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,480
our Theory and it solidifies our

560
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,960
understanding because the theory is is

561
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,640
the thing that helps tailor our way

562
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,279
towards knowledge and understanding um

563
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,039
so the thing in devops if you've not

564
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:00,200
heard of it something called the three

565
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:03,200
ways of devops these are kind of the

566
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,880
core tenants I guess they're probably

567
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,880
not universally agreed but these are the

568
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,520
core tenants in in the way I think about

569
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:15,240
it or of um of devops this is that

570
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,919
perspective shift to what's the theory

571
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,440
that we generate the body of theory we

572
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,600
generate that we then build all this

573
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,760
other stuff on top of because we've seen

574
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,799
it working right in organizations so

575
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
then what are the commonalities what are

576
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,600
the theories that we can um

577
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
understand that will then work in

578
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,480
everywhere else as well because

579
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,799
everywhere else is different so the

580
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,640
theories are the bit that connects it

581
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,320
all together so the first the three ways

582
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,399
of devops are are systems thinking

583
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,520
amplifying feedback loops um and culture

584
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:49,919
of continual learning and

585
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,320
experimentation um so systems thinking

586
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,760
uh the first one is really really

587
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,880
important that we can't think about

588
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,200
systems in

589
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,840
isolation so if you think about your

590
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,080
software as the system and that's what

591
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,159
I'm working with what about the people

592
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,760
that are doing things around your system

593
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,240
what about the automations that are in

594
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,880
place that build and deploy your system

595
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,640
the system is your entire organization

596
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,200
and everything that impacts on your

597
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,159
system so we have to look at all of

598
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,279
those things we have to take the

599
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,200
blinkers off and raise that impact

600
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,120
because if we

601
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,679
don't look at systems thinking as a

602
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,080
wider View as part of of devops and

603
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:35,559
agile as well right and agile as well

604
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,000
but we're not thinking about systems and

605
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,320
we think about just one small part we

606
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,679
might make optimizations for the part

607
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,480
that don't in fact result in a better

608
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,600
outcome for the entire system so we end

609
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,600
up uh making incorrect choices that

610
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,480
maybe inhibit uh the rest of the

611
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,240
system I'm not sure that I'm not

612
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,600
explaining that well let me think about

613
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,039
how I can explain that better better um

614
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,360
there are definitely things that I've

615
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,559
done where I've made a change to the way

616
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,559
I do things on the small scale that

617
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:15,240
means that the bigger scale of things is

618
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:18,679
harder to do so an example of not

619
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:22,440
thinking of the big picture in the IT

620
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,559
world is where um

621
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,360
organizations have a centralized

622
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,000
security department and the security

623
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,480
department in order to optimize their

624
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,679
world of

625
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,520
security they decide that everybody has

626
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,799
to use for example a virtual a virtual

627
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,480
machine right so in order to maximize

628
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,399
our ability to be secure and this this

629
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,320
makes per this a perfectly logical uh

630
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:52,399
consequence we want to 100% secure all

631
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,399
of our stuff okay nobody's allowed to do

632
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,720
work remotely in order to interact with

633
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,960
any of our systems you have to be on our

634
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,480
Network on our Hardware therefore we're

635
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,640
going to prevent anybody from doing

636
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,320
anything else or you could do what

637
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,679
Microsoft does for example um when

638
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,519
you're working with Microsoft you can

639
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:20,200
buy your own physical Hardware join your

640
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,720
own physical Hardware to their domain

641
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,480
they then take control of that hardware

642
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,159
and validate that it has all of the

643
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,720
security requirements that they need

644
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,919
they can remote wipe it and suddenly

645
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,360
you're able to work with any local

646
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,320
machine on their systems and be able to

647
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,880
interact um with a local machine right

648
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,960
you've got full low latency uh uh access

649
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,080
to everything moving stuff around that

650
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,600
kind of thing that is more effective

651
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,039
that's a let's take security with a

652
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,120
wider picture of everybody needs to be

653
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,559
able to do the job that the business

654
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,760
requires rather than focusing on

655
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:03,159
security as a blinkered view of just

656
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,279
that thing that's an example of systems

657
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:08,279
thinking it's widening that view and

658
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,799
looking at the wider scope of things the

659
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:14,559
second one is amplifying feedback loops

660
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,200
we need to be able to not only have

661
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,000
feedback loops but how do we maximize

662
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,679
the value in those feedback loops how do

663
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,440
we increase our ability to do stuff with

664
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,799
those feedback loops um so a great

665
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,480
example is when you're using Telemetry

666
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,559
right do you have the right Telemetry

667
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,600
not just do we have Telemetry from our

668
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,440
product seeing how people are using it

669
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,080
but do we have the right Telemetry with

670
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,120
the right timings of the right things

671
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,240
and how do we enable ourselves to get

672
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,880
the right data to then make different

673
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,880
choices on the way we do uh build

674
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,240
deliver our applications to customers

675
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,159
and what what we actually focus on those

676
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,159
feedback loops are hugely important in

677
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,080
in scrum we have loads of feedback loops

678
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
implementing that empirical process

679
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,399
control

680
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,000
system and then the third thing is that

681
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:11,440
cultural that culture of continual

682
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,240
experimentation and

683
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:19,440
learning that that how do we

684
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,440
enable people to not get blamed for

685
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
mistakes right we want to take

686
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,120
accountability for our actions that

687
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,640
we're going to be doing as much of the

688
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,960
right thing as possible but in order

689
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,399
to push the boundaries in order to

690
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,240
experiment not all experiments are

691
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:41,799
successful and that's normal it's normal

692
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,039
that not everything goes well so how do

693
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:47,760
we create an environment within which

694
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,000
we're able to not just punish people for

695
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,279
things going wrong but explore what was

696
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,399
the root cause of things going wrong and

697
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,000
how do we change the way our system

698
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:01,200
works in or in order to to

699
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,679
enable less of those things that go

700
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,600
wrong to happen and how do we change the

701
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,919
way we do things in order to minimize

702
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,559
our recovery time and maximize our

703
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,559
learning from the from the outcomes

704
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:17,880
these are uh uh the most important

705
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,480
things in application life cycle

706
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:26,399
management which became devops and that

707
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,679
story of the other side of the coin from

708
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,159
agile agil coming from the business

709
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,600
perspective devops coming from the

710
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,279
engineering perspective both focused on

711
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,519
trying to solve that same

712
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:48,399
problem at naked agility we love devops

713
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,360
um devops is how we engage with our

714
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,600
customers it's how we enable them to be

715
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,840
more effective it's how we get people

716
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,600
working together combination of devops

717
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,120
and agile practices which quite often

718
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,240
are the same practices um and it enables

719
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:09,120
us to help teams because there are there

720
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,200
are well-known metrics that we can use

721
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,279
in the devop space if you look at the

722
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
Dora report you'll find a bunch of

723
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,919
metrics um that you can use to get an

724
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,600
understanding of where are we as an

725
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,559
organization are we focused on the right

726
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,679
things are we looking at holistic

727
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,279
systems or are we you know H looking at

728
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,480
isolated things are we amplifying the

729
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,960
feedback do we can can people even

730
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,919
amplify their feedback loops or is

731
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,679
everything restricted and locked down

732
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,559
enclosed and there's no experimentation

733
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,080
no learning no ability to change

734
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,600
anything no ability to to do anything

735
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,480
