1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,099
oh that's a that's a great question why

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,679
why is a scrum team better served by an

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,420
agile consultant rather than a

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,900
professional coach

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,439
um I think professional coaching within

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,900
the context of a specialist task

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,699
has its has its limits right it kind of

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,099
professional coaching is is great but it

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,780
makes the Assumption which in many

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,640
circumstances is the correct assumption

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,280
that the people that you're coaching

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,719
understand already understand how to

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,579
solve the problems that they need to

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,660
solve and and that's just not

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,300
fundamentally the case uh for almost all

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,579
organizations and teams that at least

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,739
that I work with

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,260
um once teams are up to speed and

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,379
heading in the right direction then we

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,020
might want to focus on more uh a more

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,780
cultural Focus but certainly early on

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,140
and certainly if teams aren't yet able

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,680
to continuously create usable working

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,540
working product in a regular Cadence

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,900
they need to know what they don't know

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,799
which means that uh an agile consultant

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,520
or an agile coach is spending more of

28
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,000
their time in a teaching or mentoring

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,640
stance where they're helping those teams

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,740
understand what they don't know or

31
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,560
perhaps

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,060
um

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,100
knowing to look where they don't know

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,439
right I mean that that that's the the

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,119
fundamental problem with

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,119
um having an agile coach that doesn't

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,240
have a deep technical understanding of

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,159
the the work that is underway and and I

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,860
I by technical understanding I don't

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,380
mean that they can they can go rock up

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,479
next to the developer and code and then

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,100
go sit next to the devops guy and point

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,040
out where he's doing his builds wrong

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,259
right that's not what I mean I mean a a

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,240
deep Technical and philosophical

46
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,700
understanding of the processes practice

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,340
these tools capabilities the the

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,379
direction the the what what are the

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,080
things that great teams do out in the

50
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,580
world that other teams don't that are to

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
do with their engineering practices

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,920
right if we're talking about a software

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,080
team you need to be able to understand

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,819
um what what what is what is devops what

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,160
are the components that make up devops

56
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,660
why is devops successful how do you

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,520
convince a team that they should be

58
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,319
doing some of those things how do you

59
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,180
have conversations with of themes about

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,239
continuous delivery if they're not doing

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,640
it and perhaps the teams say oh we can't

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,200
do that here right

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,360
um how do you have those conversations

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,900
allay those fears within the

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
organization to enable that for those

66
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,800
teams so that those teams are then able

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,379
to make that choice now they understand

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,480
that it's valuable they can't just make

69
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,280
the choice you need to help out with the

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,560
organization help convince people that

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,860
this is the right direction

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,200
um and that's even before you've tackled

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,060
any of those ideas around

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
um how how you know people's people

75
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,760
feeling happy being safe you you they

76
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
need to be able to to do their do their

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,300
job as well so I feel like for agile

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,080
consulting or even agile coaching

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:28,080
the vast majority of the work uh that

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,239
they that they do that they focus on is

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,920
around these technical things scrums are

82
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,300
while scrum itself is not technical it's

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,879
just a bit of knowledge that you learn

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,180
right all of the practices and Tools

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,799
around making it successful are deeply

86
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,080
technical

87
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,180
um are you able to sit with uh with a

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,080
group of product owners or or product

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,420
management and help them understand

90
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,260
uh impact mapping and how impact mapping

91
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,200
can help them and help coach them in

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,739
doing that technical task right which is

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,920
creating the impact map those are all

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,019
things that I would expect an agile

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,720
coach slash consultant to be able to do

96
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,780
now I've named some specific things

97
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,639
right like impact mapping you definitely

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,440
don't have to know them all right

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,500
because there's hundreds of thousands of

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,960
these things but you need to know you

101
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,600
need two things you need to know enough

102
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,639
to know where to look right that's

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,340
that's that's that's what the first part

104
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,740
if you've got enough experience and you

105
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,180
know where different tools and

106
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,979
techniques have helped in the past you

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,600
can then go read up on that tool and

108
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,220
technique and because you already

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,740
understand all of the foundational

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,440
Concepts and constructs you're able to

111
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,960
to bring that into your Lexicon your

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,880
capability a lot more quickly and then

113
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,860
engage with the team and help them or

114
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,680
our group of people and help them figure

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,900
out how to actually do that particular

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,460
particular thing and it can be a

117
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,520
learning opportunity for you as well

118
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,880
deep technical expertise in the

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,580
fundamental principles of agile and lean

120
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,040
and devops doesn't mean you know how to

121
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,440
do all of the things it means you have

122
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,979
the tools and skills to be able to learn

123
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,360
and communicate all of those things

124
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,520
regardless of the environment that

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,680
you're that you're that you're dropped

126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,660
into right yeah
