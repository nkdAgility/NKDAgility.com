Can your product pass the done test? Good done isn't aspirational. It's objective. It's measurable.

A strong definition of done means the increment is tested, deployed, monitored, gathering telemetry, validating or diminishing a real business hypothesis. It's not about tasks being finished. It's about outcomes being real. It's about delivering something that works, that's safe, that's valuable, and that you can learn from immediately.

We help teams set real-world benchmarks for excellence because raising the bar on done raises everything else with it: quality, agility, trust, time to value.
