1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,200
building a high performance delivery

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,880
engine in your organization is super

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:12,559
hard we we need to

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,759
have expertise within our teams within

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,279
various contexts and I

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,840
think we mostly underestimate the level

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,760
of competence that's required for the

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,279
people participating within the the the

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,480
software delivery process to to build

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,000
those those those High performing teams

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,239
High performing delivery engine to get

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,239
get stuff out the

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,280
door we need not only competence in the

14
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,320
technical tasks that's that's usually

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,520
what most organizations focus on we also

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,680
need competence within the context of

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,320
business right business and business

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,239
need and how business works and what

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,600
business

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:59,039
wants every member of the team should be

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,800
a a a a product developer well every

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,840
member you're you're going to have some

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,960
extremely um unusual technical people

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,439
who probably just want to focus on the

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,680
technical side but you want to have at

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,320
least a high enough number of product

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,360
developers rather than just software

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,920
developers on your team and what I mean

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,400
by that is that they're focused on

30
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,920
product and delivering a successful

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,280
product which includes many different

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,880
things right you don't just magic ically

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,600
deliver a successful product you need to

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,479
focus on the the the do we have the

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
right Technologies do we have the right

36
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,640
technical skills to be able to deliver

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,399
this product do we understand the

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,119
business need do we do we have the right

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
hypothesis to be able to test our

40
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,840
product within the market have we got

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,880
the right Market fit do we need to

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
change the way we do things this is

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,600
every member of of of the team are as

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
much as possible thinking about these

45
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,920
things as they're building the product

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,479
as they're developing features

47
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,920
and then you also need a keen a keen

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,679
understanding of the

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,879
the

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,280
philosophies and theories Behind these

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,680
things that we're talk we're talking

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,720
about agile we're talking about devops

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,519
we're talking about lean talking about

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,200
scrum right and mixing a few things in

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,879
there but we need to understand the core

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,720
philosophies theories and practices that

57
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,319
underpin these things

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,519
so that we can apply them in a way that

59
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,080
adds value to our organization right

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,400
because we're we're trying to deliver

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,159
we're trying to create a high performing

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,599
delivery engine we're trying to deliver

63
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,360
lots of stuff and lots of the right

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
stuff or as much of the right stuff as

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:54,599
we can and for that we need to be able

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:58,120
to leverage the right emergent practices

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,840
right the the evolution of our practices

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,360
over the life of the the product side

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,280
cycle and how we we pick the best stuff

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,519
and to do that the people doing the work

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,840
the people managing the work the people

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,440
overseeing the work all need to be

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,799
practitioners right they need to be

74
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,560
playing at the practitioner level to

75
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,239
understand how those things influence it

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
I I usually the the analogy I usually

77
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,640
use is if you're you're renovating your

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
house and you want to remove a wall

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,120
right so we we we we want to change the

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
way we fundamentally do something and

81
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,640
see whether it makes sense can we just

82
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,879
knock down that wall well no we should

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
probably do a little bit of due

84
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,280
diligence we should probably understand

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,920
the structural Integrity of the context

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,720
we should probably understand whether is

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
this a good idea to remove the wall or

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,439
is it a bad idea and if it's a bad idea

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,560
is there something we can do to mitigate

90
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,760
it so we can do it because we want to do

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,720
it right and and and you can abs

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,239
absolutely remove any wall in your house

93
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,959
any wall in your house with due

94
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,280
diligence to the structural Integrity of

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
the building same is true when you're

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
changing your business when you're

97
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
changing your your team structure when

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,000
you're changing your system of doing

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,239
work you need to have the competence in

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,919
your high performing delivery engine to

101
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,479
build it in a way that enables you to

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,880
maximize the value delivery to your

103
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,880
stakeholder
