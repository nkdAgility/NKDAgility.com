Building a high-performance delivery engine within an organisation is no small feat. From my experience, it requires a deep understanding of various contexts and a level of competence that is often underestimated. Many organisations focus primarily on technical skills, but to truly excel in software delivery, we need to broaden our perspective.

### The Importance of Competence

When I talk about competence, I’m not just referring to technical expertise. While that’s crucial, we also need a solid grasp of business needs and how the business operates. Here’s what I believe every team member should embody:

- **Product Developers, Not Just Software Developers**: Every member of the team should think like a product developer. This means focusing on delivering a successful product, which encompasses much more than just writing code. It involves understanding:
  - The right technologies to use
  - The business needs driving the product
  - Valid hypotheses to test in the market
  - Achieving the right market fit

By fostering a mindset where everyone is engaged in product development, we can ensure that our teams are not just executing tasks but are actively contributing to the product's success.

### Embracing Core Philosophies

To build a high-performing delivery engine, we must also embrace the philosophies and theories that underpin our practices. This includes Agile, DevOps, Lean, and Scrum. Understanding these frameworks allows us to apply them effectively, adding real value to our organisation. Here’s how we can leverage these philosophies:

- **Emergent Practices**: As we progress through the product lifecycle, we need to evolve our practices. This means being open to change and willing to adopt the best methods that emerge over time.

- **Practitioner Mindset**: Everyone involved in the work—whether they are doing it, managing it, or overseeing it—needs to operate at a practitioner level. This hands-on approach helps us understand how different practices influence our outcomes.

### The Analogy of Renovating a House

I often use the analogy of renovating a house to illustrate this point. Imagine you want to remove a wall to change the layout of your home. Before you start swinging a sledgehammer, you’d conduct due diligence to assess the structural integrity of the building. The same principle applies to changing your business or team structure. 

- **Due Diligence**: Before making significant changes, we must understand the implications. Is it a good idea to remove that wall? If not, can we mitigate the risks? This careful consideration is essential for ensuring that our changes lead to positive outcomes.

### Maximising Value Delivery

Ultimately, the goal of building a high-performance delivery engine is to maximise value delivery to our stakeholders. This requires:

- **Competence Across the Board**: From technical skills to business acumen, every team member must possess the necessary competence to contribute effectively.

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Encouraging open dialogue among team members fosters a culture of collaboration, where everyone feels empowered to share their insights and ideas.

- **Continuous Improvement**: We should always be looking for ways to improve our processes and practices, ensuring that we adapt to changing circumstances and market demands.

In conclusion, building a high-performance delivery engine is a complex but rewarding endeavour. By focusing on competence, embracing core philosophies, and ensuring that every team member acts as a product developer, we can create an environment that not only delivers high-quality products but also drives business success. Let’s commit to this journey together, ensuring that we build a delivery engine that truly meets the needs of our stakeholders.
