Building a high-performance delivery engine within an organisation is no small feat. From my experience, it requires a deep understanding of various contexts and a level of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}) that is often underestimated. Many organisations focus primarily on technical skills, but to truly excel in software delivery, we need to broaden our perspective.

### The Importance of Competence

When I talk about competence, I’m not just referring to technical expertise. While that’s crucial, we also need a solid grasp of business needs and how the business operates. Here’s what I believe every team member should embody:

- **Product Developers, Not Just Software Developers**: Every member of the team should think like a product developer. This means focusing on delivering a successful product, which encompasses much more than just writing code. It involves understanding:
  - The right technologies to use
  - The business needs driving the product
  - Valid hypotheses to test in the market
  - Achieving the right market fit

By fostering a mindset where everyone is engaged in [product development]({{< ref "/categories/product-development" >}}), we can ensure that our teams are not just executing tasks but are actively contributing to the product's success.

### Embracing Core Philosophies

To build a high-performing delivery engine, we must also embrace the philosophies and theories that underpin our practices. This includes Agile, [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), [Lean]({{< ref "/categories/lean" >}}), and [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}). Understanding these frameworks allows us to apply them effectively, adding real value to our organisation. Here’s how we can leverage these philosophies:

- **Emergent Practices**: As we progress through the product lifecycle, we need to evolve our practices. This means being open to change and willing to adopt the best methods that emerge over time.

- **Practitioner Mindset**: Everyone involved in the work—whether they are doing it, managing it, or overseeing it—needs to operate at a practitioner level. This hands-on approach helps us understand how different practices influence our outcomes.

### The Analogy of Renovating a House

I often use the analogy of renovating a house to illustrate this point. Imagine you want to remove a wall to change the layout of your home. Before you start swinging a sledgehammer, you’d conduct due diligence to assess the structural integrity of the building. The same principle applies to changing your business or team structure. 

- **Due Diligence**: Before making significant changes, we must understand the implications. Is it a good idea to remove that wall? If not, can we mitigate the risks? This careful consideration is essential for ensuring that our changes lead to positive outcomes.

### Maximising [Value Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}})

Ultimately, the goal of building a high-performance delivery engine is to maximise value delivery to our stakeholders. This requires:

- **Competence Across the Board**: From technical skills to business acumen, every team member must possess the necessary competence to contribute effectively.

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Encouraging open dialogue among team members fosters a culture of collaboration, where everyone feels empowered to share their insights and ideas.

- **[Continuous Improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}})**: We should always be looking for ways to improve our processes and practices, ensuring that we adapt to changing circumstances and market demands.

In conclusion, building a high-performance delivery engine is a complex but rewarding endeavour. By focusing on competence, embracing core philosophies, and ensuring that every team member acts as a product developer, we can create an environment that not only delivers high-quality products but also drives business success. Let’s commit to this journey together, ensuring that we build a delivery engine that truly meets the needs of our stakeholders.
