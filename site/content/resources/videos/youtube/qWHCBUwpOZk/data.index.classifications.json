    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses workflow improvement in Kanban via removing bottlenecks, reducing waiting times, and increasing stakeholder visibility. However, it does not mention Service Level Expectation (SLE) at all, nor does it address the definition, calculation, or application of SLE. There is a heavy emphasis on real-world process improvement, stakeholder engagement, and using metrics (such as cost of delays), but these are not framed in SLE terms nor are SLE-specific concepts (like forecasting delivery probability or historical cycle time analysis for estimating SLE) covered explicitly or implicitly. The closest relevant dimension is the general Kanban audience and overall focus on improving predictability and flow, which SLE supports, but this is indirect. No penalties were applied, as there is no evidence of obsolete practices or contradictory framing. Overall, the lack of direct SLE reference and specificity leads to a low confidence score for this category.",
