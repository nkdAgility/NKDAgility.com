# 3 core practices of Kanban Improving a workflow

Maximizing Flow with Kanban: A Strategy for Success

Unlock the Potential of Your Workflow

In the realm of Kanban, improving your workflow stands as a cornerstone practice. It's not just about setting up a system; it's about continually refining it to ensure peak efficiency and value delivery. Below, discover key insights and strategies from our latest video to enhance your workflow and drive success.

Visualize, Manage, Improve

Visualize Your Workflow: The first step is to have a clear visual representation of your entire process. This visibility is crucial for identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
Actively Manage Work: Actively managing your workflow means not just observing but taking action. Adjust work in progress, tackle blockages, and ensure work doesn't pile up or linger unfinished.
Improve Continuously: The essence of Kanban. Once you've visualized and managed, the next step is to improve. Identifying problems is one thing; implementing changes to solve them is where the true benefit lies.

Case Study: Transforming Approvals

A compelling example shared in the video highlights the power of proactive workflow management. A team faced delays due to a weekly approval process, causing a backlog of work. By visualizing the cost of delays on their Kanban board, they not only made the problem visible to all, including decision-makers, but also motivated immediate change. The approver adjusted their behavior, checking for items needing approval twice daily, significantly reducing wait times and boosting the team's efficiency.

Key Takeaways

Identify and Address Blockages: Understand the root cause of delays and blockages in your system and take decisive action to remove them.
Visualize Impact: Use visual tools to highlight the cost or impact of inefficiencies in your workflow. This can prompt necessary changes and improve accountability.
Embrace Continuous Improvement: Always look for ways to refine and enhance your workflow. Small adjustments can lead to significant gains in efficiency and value delivery.
