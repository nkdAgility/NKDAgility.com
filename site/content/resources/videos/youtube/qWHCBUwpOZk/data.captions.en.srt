1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,240
the third most powerful practice in

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:10,639
caman is improving your

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,840
workflow it's all well and good to have

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
your visualization so you can see

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,680
everything that's going on it's all well

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,080
and good to actively manage The Works

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,760
through the

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,359
system but if your system's broken or

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,119
your system could be

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,840
improved and you don't do

11
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,559
anything that's not not going to Bod

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,760
well for the future right so improving

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,879
the workflow making changes to the

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,840
system in order to maximize the flow of

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:48,120
value through the system can help us

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,680
prevent things like blockages and uh uh

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,000
things backing up in the system things

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
getting old in the system once you've

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,480
identified why those things are

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,079
happening you need to actually do

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,480
something you need to actually change

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,239
the system in order to make those things

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,280
more

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,799
effective so many so many so many teams

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,520
will just sit there and they'll

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,759
understand that there's a problem with

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,520
the system and they'll just say well we

28
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,720
can't do anything about it that's that's

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,640
Bob Bob Bob is is is getting in the way

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,200
and Bob is not doing something he's

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,119
supposed to do in a regular Cadence um I

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,720
wor worked with a team uh in the US and

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,280
what we we had the caman board on the

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,759
wall right and we couldn't change this

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,439
part of the system okay because it was

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,320
it was our caman but we had a

37
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,560
dependency right that might be something

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,000
you actively manage away uh we had a

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,680
dependency on on somebody else and it

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,399
was basically an approval state right so

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,520
stuff would go through our system and

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
then at this point it had to be approved

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,960
and then it would continue through our

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
system and the person who did the

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,799
approvals didn't want to look at the

46
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
board every day didn't want to approve

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,759
stuff every day so he did weekly

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,160
approvals he would every I can't

49
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,440
remember what day it was let's say it's

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,879
Monday every Monday he opens up the

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
board uh Monday morning he opens up the

52
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,040
board and approves the things that need

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,480
approved but what if we finish something

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,640
Monday

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,280
afternoon that sits there for seven days

56
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,440
before it gets approved so what started

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,879
doing our our board was this we were

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,400
quite it was quite lucky our board was

59
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:40,440
on the wall in the main area of our our

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,760
our business right in the corridor where

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,319
everybody was going past like everybody

62
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,000
the CEO CFO everybody would go past this

63
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,800
board and what we did was in that column

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,640
just at the bottom of that column we

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,319
started adding Post-its in there that

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,319
listed Financial numbers we kind of came

67
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,080
up with a calculation this was part of

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,200
our actively managing how much does it

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,480
cost for things to be sitting waiting to

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,840
be approved and we started putting that

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,239
cost in there and those numbers would go

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,560
up uh towards the end of the the week

73
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,760
and then they would go to zero on Monday

74
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,360
and then they would start building up

75
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,840
again and go to zero and start building

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,360
up again and we had a little graph

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,720
showing showing that that flow of that

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
bad flow of work through the system and

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,840
at some point that person whose job it

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,799
was to approve walked past that board

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,680
and kind of had a double take and kind

82
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,599
of went what what are these what are

83
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,400
these

84
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,519
numbers and we just explained that's the

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,280
cost of these items sitting there and

86
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,799
waiting that's our weight time cost so

87
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,400
we thought we would put it on the board

88
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,120
because this is where one of our bigger

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,920
costs is and what happened that person

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,480
changed their behavior almost

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,079
immediately and started

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
checking every morning for anything that

93
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,920
was blocked or needed approved in fact I

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,159
think at one point they were checking

95
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,720
every morning and every end of day so

96
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,599
that everything was just blowing through

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,000
the system and that was the single

98
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,000
biggest uh cost benefit that that team

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,960
had in a six six Monon period was

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,199
reducing that cost of delay of things

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,680
sitting there and not being approved

102
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,160
when they were in fact valid they were

103
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,360
in fact approvable IE they would be

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,960
approved uh um and it just waiting so

105
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,400
changing your workflow or creating a

106
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:49,639
situation within which that workflow is

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,960
changed is one of the three most

108
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,880
important principles of a caman strategy

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,320
that the things you have to have in

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,720
caman if you're struggling to implement

111
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
a camman strategy

112
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,639
