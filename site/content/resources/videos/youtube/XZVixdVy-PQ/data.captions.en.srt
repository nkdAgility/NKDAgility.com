1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
so there's a quote from Ken schweber uh

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,520
which agile is not about rituals it's

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,559
about developing software in a different

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,559
way and I would broaden it out first and

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,279
say um agile is not about rituals it's

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,039
about developing products in a different

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,080
way it's broadening that out in in

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:28,240
organizations the the goal is not

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,480
agility the goal is not the rituals

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,920
right they're part of the system

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,840
but they're not the thing you're trying

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,280
to

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:41,640
achieve um most organizations seem to

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,640
measure success in adopting

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,719
agile as is everybody doing a daily

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,960
scrum does everybody have a Sprint

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,320
review um and those

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,320
things those measures the behavioral

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,760
outcome from those measures is that you

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,800
end up with zombie scrum or mechanical

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,719
scrum right or mechanical processes

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,159
people are following the processes

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,759
because they're told to follow the

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,880
processes not because they believe that

25
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,400
they are the right processes to follow

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,000
in order to get the outcomes that the

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,680
business needs and that's where the

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
failure is why are people just following

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,600
the

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,040
rules why don't they believe in the

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,960
rules because if they believe in the

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,400
rules they'll perhaps make better

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,360
decisions right if they believe that

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,040
this is the way we need to do things

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,799
they'll figure F out better and more

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
effective ways to do things and this is

37
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,399
this is actually why it's it's really

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:45,000
hard when you um purchase large scale

39
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,040
sweeping software systems um that take

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,200
care of like let's say your entire

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,799
procurement pipeline is now fully

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,759
automated uh but now you're stuck in

43
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,000
that automation you're stuck in the

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,399
rituals that that automation has created

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,520
um and that's the difference between how

46
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,119
we've

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,560
implemented the Toyota Way in the west

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,480
and how Toyota implemented it Toyota

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,599
didn't have a fully automated production

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,720
line they had lots of pieces of

51
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:22,920
automation for the work that people do

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,920
but they had people checks at the end of

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,160
every one of those pieces of automation

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,879
because you're building big complex

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:33,920
products it's a big complex system and

56
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,040
computers are not actually that great at

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,000
managing big complex systems cuz they

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,040
only manage what we think of for them to

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,360
manage right we have to think of it in

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,400
order for it to be managed so you end up

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
with stuff built on top as you figure

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,720
out different edge cases and different

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,720
scenarios and it's the same with our

64
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,120
policies and procedures in organizations

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,840
right it builds up this organizational

66
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,800
or software crft uh that is all the

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,959
rules around which it runs um and that's

68
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,560
and that's the same as delivering trying

69
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,599
to deploy or install agile in your

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
organization it's not about the rituals

71
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,959
it's about doing things in different

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,799
ways right you want to uh build software

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,319
in different ways you want to build

74
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,959
products in different ways you want to

75
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,519
do business in different ways that

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,760
maximize the return on

77
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,080
investment that's what agile ISM all

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,680
about doing things in different ways if

79
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,040
you want to have a discussion about your

80
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,120
unique needs or situation then please

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,040
book a call or visit us at naked agility

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,519
tocom uh we also have our immersive and

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,879
traditional public classes on our

84
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,879
website and we'd love to hear from you
