#scrum has become one of the most popular #agileframeworks in #agile, with successful adoptions in multiple geographies, in multiple applications around the world.

With that growth has come significant opportunities. In this context, it has created the accountability of #scrummaster which in turn leads to opportunities in #agileleadership after mastering the accountability across multiple teams and environments.

So, given the opportunities available, why do so few #scrummasters invest in progressing to the #PSMII and #PSMIII certifications? Why don't more people see it as a path to competitive advantage and a great way to demonstrate that they have the skills, knowledge, and capabilities of a scrum master
