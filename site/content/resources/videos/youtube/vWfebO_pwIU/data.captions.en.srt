1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,400
the question is why do so few scrum

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,639
Masters progressed to the psn2 or the

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,560
psn3 certification

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
um and and ultimately it's because

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,539
because they don't care right they're

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,580
they didn't do it in order to become

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,740
better scrum Masters or to understand

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,240
the depth and breadth of being a scrum

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,040
Master quite a lot of people do it

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,980
because they've either been told to do

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,620
it right their company has said go take

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,800
this class or

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,200
um the the the the had they took the

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,820
class in order to get a certificate I

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,219
always know those people because the

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,780
first thing they ask is you know what

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,760
happens with the exam what happens with

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,620
the assessment that's you know that

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,199
that's all they care about they want the

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,780
they want the the certificate

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,520
um for a job interview or for their

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,699
professional development or whatever it

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
is their company's company's doing

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,460
um and those are ultimately not

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,260
peop they don't they don't care I I read

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,320
this blog post once it was absolutely

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,880
fantastic and it basically started with

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,780
this phrase

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,180
if you're reading this you're already in

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,799
the top 10 of all software Engineers

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,979
right

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,780
and what the author was getting at was

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,560
that

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,740
there are so few people doing jobs and

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,840
work that they actually care about that

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,439
they actually love that they're willing

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,659
to invest additional time perhaps

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,180
outside of work in going and reading

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,159
content on finding out what's going on

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,799
and interacting with other people in

41
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,840
their profession and learning more about

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,939
it they just they just I'm done with

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
work we're we're done and I'll pick it

44
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,020
up tomorrow and I'm only going to do

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,380
these with stuff within work time and

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,219
that's

47
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:08,819
not necessarily the type of person that

48
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,259
is looking to to to launch their career

49
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,080
in a particular direction that is

50
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,700
looking to to to to to to help and

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,599
benefit a bunch of people working

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,160
towards a common goal if if you're if

53
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,680
you're interested in those things you're

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,140
going to spend the time to go you know

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,319
listen listen to some podcasts right

56
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,300
outside of uh uh at work you're going to

57
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,280
or you're enduring your commute right

58
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,780
you're gonna instead of watching movies

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,700
during your commute you're going to be

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,400
listening to podcasts and reading blog

61
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,500
posts and learning more maybe perhaps

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,519
reading some agile books

63
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,160
um and though those are the folks

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,940
that actually progressed to psm2 and

65
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,920
psm3 because they're actually interested

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,459
in the content they're interested in the

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,220
topic they're interested in in

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,900
helping other people particularly for

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,599
the PSM right because that's the scrum

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,819
Masters accountability is the

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,379
effectiveness of the team and the

72
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,739
generation of value within the context

73
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,720
of the organization so how do they learn

74
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,140
those new things how do they figure out

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,700
uh what it is they do I one of my

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,220
favorite Expressions actually from a

77
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,220
good friend of mine David Starr and I

78
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,720
worked for Microsoft in the in in the US

79
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,659
and he said

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,060
um what do violinists and martial

81
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,459
artists have in common

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,200
that was his his question and you're

83
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,599
kind of like well I don't know those

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,640
seem like very different things but the

85
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,519
answer is they practice

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,519
right that's how they get good at what

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,739
they do is they practice when do we

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,260
practice when when do we get to practice

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,099
our craft you tend to spend all day at

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,980
work

91
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,500
fulfilling your craft where's the time

92
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,840
that you spend on making your craft

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,720
better on on studying new ways of doing

94
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,940
things of of of of perhaps practicing

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,620
some of those things

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,659
um

97
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,739
that's the the the the type of person

98
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,500
that transitions to psm2 and and perhaps

99
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,320
psm3 right somebody who's really

100
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,440
interested in diving deep learning more

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,620
and helping other people uh get better

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,040
at what they do by thinking about how

103
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,639
can they help themselves be better at

104
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,639
what they do
