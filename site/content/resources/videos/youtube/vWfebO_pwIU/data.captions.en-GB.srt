1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,960
The question is, why do so few
Scrum Masters progress to the PSN two

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,780
or the PSN three certification?

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,510
And ultimately it's
because they don't care, right?

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,110
They didn't do it in order to
become better Scrum Masters

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,060
or to understand the depth
and breadth of being a Scrum Master.

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,360
Quite a lot of people do it
because they've either been told to do it,

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,170
right? Their
company has said,

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,810
go take this class.

9
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,540
Or

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,700
they took the class
in order to get a certificate.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,610
I always know who those people are,
because the first thing they ask is,

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,640
"what happens with the exam?
What happens with the assessment?"

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,180
You know that that's all they care about.
They want the certificate

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,980
for a job interview or for
their professional development or

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,460
whatever it is their company's doing.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,520
And those are ultimately not people.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,740
They don't care.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,110
I read this blog post once.
It was absolutely fantastic.

19
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,980
And it basically started with this phrase.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,540
"If you're reading this, you're already
in the top 10% of all software engineers",

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,660

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:31,300
And what the author was getting at was
that there are so few people doing jobs

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,880
and work that they actually care about,
that they actually love,

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,770
that they're willing
to invest additional time,

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,390
perhaps outside of work,
in going and reading content,

26
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,080
on finding out what's going on,
on interacting with other people in

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,120
their profession

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,120
and learning more about it.
They just, I'm done with work.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,260
We're done. I'll pick
it up tomorrow.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,430
And I'm only going to do these
with stuff within work time.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:04,160
And that's not
necessarily the type of person

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,920
that is looking to launch
their career in a particular direction,

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,000
that is looking to help
and benefit a bunch of people working

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,620
towards a common goal.

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,910
If you're interested
in those things, you're going to spend

36
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,780
the time to go listen to some podcasts

37
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,150
outside of work,

38
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,980
or during your commute.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,160
Instead of watching
movies during your commute,

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,540
you're going to be listening to podcasts
and reading blog posts and learning more,

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,720
maybe perhaps reading some Agile books.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,840
And those are the folks

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,600
that actually progressed to PSM2 and PSM3

44
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,780
because they're actually
interested in the content,

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,940
they're interested
in the topic, they're interested

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,920
in helping other people,
particularly for the PSM, right?

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,660
Because that's the
Scrum Masters accountability

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,680
is the effectiveness
of the team and the generation of value

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,440
within the context of the organization.

50
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,540
So how do they learn those
new things? How do they figure

51
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,130
out what it is they need to do?

52
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,580
one of my favorite expressions actually
from a good friend of mine,

53
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,120
David Starr, who now works
for Microsoft in the US, and he said,

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,530
what do violinists

55
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,870
and martial artists have in common?"

56
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,820
That was his question.

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,940
And you're kind
of like, well, I don't know.

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,900
Those seem like very different things.

59
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,860
But the answer is "they practice",

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,470
right?

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,510
That's how they get good
at what they do, is they practice.

62
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,770
When do we practice?
When do we get to practice our craft?

63
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,920
You tend to spend all day
at work fulfilling your craft.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,140
Where's the time that you
spend on making your craft better,

65
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,820
on studying new ways of doing things,

66
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,920
of perhaps practicing some
of those things?

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,340
That's the type of person
that transitions to PSM-II and perhaps PSM-III,

68
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,100
right? Somebody
who's really interested

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,440
in diving deep, learning more,
and helping other people get better

70
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,300
at what they do by thinking
about how can they help

71
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,820
themselves be better at what they do.

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,320
