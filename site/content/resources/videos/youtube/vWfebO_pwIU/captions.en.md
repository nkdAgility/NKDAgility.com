the question is why do so few scrum Masters progressed to the psm2 or the psm3 certification um and and ultimately it's because because they don't care right they're they didn't do it in order to become better scrum Masters or to understand the depth and breadth of being a scrum Master quite a lot of people do it because they've either been told to do it right their company has said go take this class or um the the the the had they took the class in order to get a certificate I always know those people because the first thing they ask is you know what happens with the exam what happens with the assessment that's you know that that's all they care about they want the they want the the certificate um for a job interview or for their professional development or whatever it is their company's company's doing um and those are ultimately not people they don't they don't care I I read this blog post once it was absolutely fantastic and it basically started with this phrase if you're reading this you're already in the top 10 of all software Engineers right and what the author was getting at was that there are so few people doing jobs and work that they actually care about that they actually love that they're willing to invest additional time perhaps outside of work in going and reading content on finding out what's going on and interacting with other people in their profession and learning more about it they just they just I'm done with work we're we're done and I'll pick it up tomorrow and I'm only going to do these with stuff within work time and that's not necessarily the type of person that is looking to to to launch their career in a particular direction that is looking to to to to to help and benefit a bunch of people working towards a common goal if if you're if you're interested in those things you're going to spend the time to go you know listen listen to some podcasts right outside of uh uh at work you're going to or you're enduring your commute right you're gonna instead of watching movies during your commute you're going to be listening to podcasts and reading blog posts and learning more maybe perhaps reading some agile books um and though those are the folks that actually progressed to psm2 and psm3 because they're actually interested in the content they're interested in the topic they're interested in in helping other people particularly for the PSM right because that's the scrum Masters accountability is the effectiveness of the team and the generation of value within the context of the organization so how do they learn those new things how do they figure out uh what it is they do I one of my favorite Expressions actually from a good friend of mine David Starr and I worked for Microsoft in the in in the US and he said um what do violinists and martial artists have in common that was his his question and you're kind of like well I don't know those seem like very different things but the answer is they practice right that's how they get good at what they do is they practice when do we practice when when do we get to practice our craft you tend to spend all day at work fulfilling your craft where's the time that you spend on making your craft better on on studying new ways of doing things of of of of perhaps practicing some of those things um that's the the the the type of person that transitions to psm2 and and perhaps psm3 right somebody who's really interested in diving deep learning more and helping other people uh get better at what they do by thinking about how can they help themselves be better at what they do thanks for watching the video If you enjoyed it please like follow And subscribe I always reply to comments and if you want to have a chat about this or anything else agile scrum or devops then please book a coffee with me through naked agility
