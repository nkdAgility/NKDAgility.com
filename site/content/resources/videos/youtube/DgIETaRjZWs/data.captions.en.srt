34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
over and over hashing it out

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
choreographing it like some crazy burger

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,840

76
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
complete disaster why opening down cars

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,760
pull up onto the lot and they start

78
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
met as heck because they're eating off

86
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
paper and they've got to discard their

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,159
the flies they must have been drawn by

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
all the lights millions of them it was

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,280
