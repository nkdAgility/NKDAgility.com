1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,320
one of the harbingers of the agile

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:16,680
apocalypse is famine and famine

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,160
manifests in organizations by lacking

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
something you know PE people teams

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,000
groups

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,720
leaders products we don't have the

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,759
things we need in order to be successful

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,200
um and quite often that's because of one

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,879
of the other harbingers the the the the

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,879
top- down management structure but it's

11
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,039
we we effectively don't have what we

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,800
need we're either we're either starved

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,640
of trust in our in our teams and our

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
organization so people can't do the

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,559
things that that they need to do because

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,960
nobody believes that they'll do it right

17
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:57,879
they might have uh starved for for money

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,480
right quite often in

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,159
organizations um you need some somebody

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,000
high enough in the organization to

21
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,720
approve the spending of money

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,240
but what if that person's high enough in

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,880
the organization that they actually

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,960
don't give a [Â __Â ] about the problem

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,520
right they actually don't care they're

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
just looking at their budget and going

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,720
it's not in my budget for this year so

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,200
no I'm not going to sign off on that

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,000
yeah but what's what's the actual real

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,240
cost of making that decision what's the

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,600
impact on the people doing the work on

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,720
the work on the customer of making that

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,840
decision it's not in my budget for this

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,680
year is not a good answer to that and it

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,920
results in that famine we don't have the

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,479
stuff we need do the people in your

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,439
organization have the training they need

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,640
uh I I work with a an organization in in

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,079
Spain a couple of organizations in Spain

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,079
where every single member of the

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,759
organization every employee has their

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,920
own budget for training they decide how

43
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,680
they want to spend it if they want to

44
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,799
spend it on some agile training or they

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,399
want to group together and buy some

46
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,080
training together or they want to spend

47
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,200
it on Technical Training or on whatever

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
they want they're able to spend it on

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,239
whatever want it's their budget that

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,680
they get to spend they're not starved

51
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,239
for things that they need they have the

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
ability to get the things that they need

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,080
how do you do that in your

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,959
organization um I'm working with an

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,360
organization at the moment that I needed

56
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,400
a piece of software as a a as a

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,879
consultant helping this organization in

58
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,120
order to facilitate I needed a license

59
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,120
for a particular piece of software and I

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,640
had to go on and request that license I

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,760
made that request uh uh two and a half

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,400
weeks ago um I escalated it a week ago

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,560
there was a little escalation button on

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,480
the page where you can uh request it so

65
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,080
I escalated it after a week of nothing

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,080
happening and I still don't have a

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
license for that software I still don't

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,319
have access to that thing

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
what is the cost and impact of that

70
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,200
delay right what is the cost and impact

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,720
to the organization of me not being able

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,280
to provide the services um that I could

73
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,799
be providing to people inside of the

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,400
organization what is the cost of all the

75
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,000
people that I would be providing those

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,360
services to that can't get those

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,720
Services because there's a fundamental

78
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,599
piece of the puzzle missing there's a

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:32,000
Blocker in the way of actually doing

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:35,239
work so famine is all about those things

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,640
that make sure that people don't have

82
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,439
the things they need it's not deliberate

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,920
right these policies somebody didn't go

84
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,560
let's make sure people don't have the

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,760
stuff they need nobody did that right

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,400
they were looking at somebody at a level

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,400
who's I I guess we would traditionally

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,159
call them Bean counters right the bean

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,480
counters are looking the amount of money

90
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,319
something cost and they want to restrict

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,959
access to that thing so it doesn't cost

92
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,560
more this could be travel this could be

93
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,920
software this could be training it could

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,000
be anything but who are the people that

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,720
understand the most about what is needed

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,840
in order to maximize the success of the

97
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,120
organization um a great example of this

98
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,720
is uh one of the organizations that I

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,400
worked with for training uh they're a

100
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,840
very big manufacturer or car

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,199
manufacturer um and they had a a

102
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
circumstance in their organization where

103
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,520
uh

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,880
machine I I I don't know what the

105
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,600
machine was doing but the machine was

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,960
creating something for for the

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,199
production line for the cars for the

108
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,520
parts right and it was no longer

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,919
operating in a way that it needed to

110
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,440
operate it was too old no matter how

111
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,320
much repair you did it wasn't going to

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,120
be able to actually do the things they

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,039
had to do a ton of workarounds to make

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,400
it actually suit the needs of the

115
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,160
business and that machine really needed

116
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,639
upgrading to the newer version of that

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,160
machine that supported more cap cap

118
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:06,160
ability that had uh uh more just was

119
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,080
able to do more stuff more cheaply more

120
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
effectively faster um and the person who

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,120
runs the machine did followed the

122
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
business procedures and wrote the

123
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,240
business case uh for for wrote business

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,360
case for it uh sent it up the chain and

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
that's it got to somebody who was

126
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,360
looking at their budget and says nope I

127
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,520
don't have $2 million in my budget for

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:32,000
this new machine so scratch it off um

129
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,960
and when they finally figured out that

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,680
one of the major problems they had was

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,199
this machine was making a defective and

132
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,880
inaccurate Parts uh they found that it

133
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:46,639
actually cost the organization over a

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:50,039
billion dollars in Lost Revenue in um

135
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
having to rework things in fixing stuff

136
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,440
in production if you can imagine if you

137
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,960
have to recall a car a car or a model of

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,039
car because something's wrong with it

139
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,639
fundamentally what's that going to cost

140
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,479
you down in the line um but it wasn't in

141
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:06,199
this Block's budget but do you think

142
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,680
that block had the had the power to

143
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,759
approve well approve a $2 billion or a

144
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,880
billion dollar loss for the comp no no

145
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,160
nobody has that that that power to be

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,720
able to do that but they can block the

147
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,160
thing that might result if it's blocked

148
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,560
it might result in that um so what they

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
did as an organization this particular

150
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,360
organization is they they pushed

151
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,479
responsibility for spending money down

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
to the people who were best placed to

153
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,800
make the decision um anybody in the

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,520
organization no matter how below you are

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,240
can approve any needed expense of any

156
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,919
amount for doing your job you might need

157
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,039
to validate it afterwards right you need

158
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,599
to it's almost like a you're you're

159
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,680
pre-approved to expense it but then you

160
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,800
have to write still have to write the

161
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,440
business case you still have to say this

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,000
is why we we we bought this this is what

163
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,440
it was for this is what it was needed

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,319
this was the impact right you still have

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,720
to do all of those due dilcy things but

166
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,560
you're not blocked from solving the

167
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,440
problem what's causing famine in your

168
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,639
