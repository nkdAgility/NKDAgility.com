1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,019
so the question is what is the most

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,760
destructive thing that a client can do

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,839
to an agile consultant

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,840
and I think it's shut them down it's not

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,840
not let them engage not let them uh

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,500
speak and engage with people in your

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,380
organization because I feel like the

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,140
purpose of being a consultant is

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,660
actually quite it's quite often to be

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,640
difficult right because if if if if

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,280
all we do as an agile consultant is

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,860
please the customer nothing's ever going

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
to change nothing's going to be going to

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,800
be different

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,719
so instead of pleasing the customer

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
what's what's what's what's what's the

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
other side of that right what what's the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,160
the the opposite of pleasing the

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,199
customer and you know it's it's being

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,960
difficult it's asking difficult

21
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,500
questions it's poking at things why is

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,460
this the way it is right and and

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,500
that needs to be enabled and encouraged

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,000
by the stakeholders in the organization

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,979
if they're going to bring in a

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,659
consultant because those are the

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,900
questions that enact

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,100
not an act change that enable the people

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,619
in your organization to think about why

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,420
something's the way it is and that act

31
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,280
of thinking about why something the way

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,540
it is is quite often the Catalyst for

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,460
the change that's needed in the

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,680
organization

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,360
um so so

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,180
allowing your Consultants

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:45,420
to be difficult add ask hard questions

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:48,479
and provoke people is is is actually

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,799
critical to to that value that you're

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,799
getting from an agile consultant
