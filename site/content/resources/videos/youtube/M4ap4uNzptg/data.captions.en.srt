1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,040
there's a quote by uh Steve Denning um

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,639
being agile is about questioning what

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,320
you do and continuously improving what

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,400
you're doing and that that really is

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,119
that fundamental kernel of what's the

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,400
difference between um what people have

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,080
always done and what agile is talking

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,599
about we'd like people to do going

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,320
forward into the future and that's that

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,719
that question everything you do why you

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,200
do it value it

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:38,399
creates and if it doesn't

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,360
have value that it creates that's

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,360
greater than the pain of doing it then

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,399
you need to change what it is you're

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,480
doing and do things differently and and

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,320
and that is why we talk about or at

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,840
least Ken talks about scrum as a mirror

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,719
right I can't do scrum because here's

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
something you need to go fix in the way

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,199
your organization does business in order

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,360
to become more effective cuz the more

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,520
effective you are at adapting to

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,040
change the more chance you have of being

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,520
successful in your Market the more

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,560
chance you have of AD adapting around

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,840
whatever it is the market throws at you

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,479
the world throws at you or your

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,040
competitors throw at you and if you can

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,840
change and adapt faster than your

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,600
competitors can you'll be the one

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,720
setting the trend in the market you'll

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,479
be the one that they're following

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,079
um and you'll be the one um making

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,880
making the money first right and that's

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,520
that's ultimately what it's what it's

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,759
all about the the the the most

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,200
capitalistic

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,399
organizations are the ones that can

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,560
change as quickly as possible to take

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,920
advantage of Market opportunities right

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,840
that's what it's all about um so so so

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,119
be that be that ninja being able to to

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,640
dynamically change your business anytime

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,520
time you need and and for that you can't

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,399
do that you can't make those decisions

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,479
as a as a leader in an organization or

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,280
as a CEO right you have to have the

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,720
people that are um at every level in

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,480
your organization need to be looking at

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
the same thing they need to be not

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,760
following the rules they need to be

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,640
questioning the rules at every possible

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,480
moment they need to be there's a better

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,519
way to do this right that could be

56
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,319
faster and quicker maybe we don't need

57
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,360
to do this at all maybe we need to do it

58
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,239
differently um those are all the

59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,440
questions that should we should be

60
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,640
constantly um asking and creating forums

61
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,720
within our

62
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,159
organization so that you can have those

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,040
things dealt with there's no point in

64
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,879
having all those questions asked and

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,440
then doing nothing about them cuz all

66
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,239
you do is end up with a bunch of

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
disgruntled people with working in your

68
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,879
organization who can see all the things

69
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,239
that need to be fixed but they're not

70
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,519
they can't fix them they don't have the

71
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,360
authority to fix them and nobody else

72
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,760
has the authority to fix them right or

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,480
nobody else wants to or senior

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
leadership doesn't doesn't care right

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,319
that's that's that's going to have a

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
massively negative impact on your

77
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,560
business so Focus

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,920
instead

79
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,680
about Focus instead on

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,360
on creating forums within your

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,720
organization where you can have those

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,200
legitimate

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
moments might be continuously where you

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,920
continuously look at and question the

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,200
things that are going on on the way you

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,920
do things uh the choices that have been

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,319
