While the Scrum Master role is mentioned, the discussion centers on conflict facilitation, communication, and team norms, not on explicit structural accountabilities or outcome ownership. There are minimal direct mentions of accountability as formally defined. The audience, tone, and focus are Agile practitioners, thus aligning moderately, but the depth and alignment regarding accountability as a structural work system mechanism are limited.",
