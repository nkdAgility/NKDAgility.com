Ah, so three. What are the three key takeaways to attending the APS class, especially the immersive APS class? 

Um, so I think the first one is that fundamental understanding of the underlying principles of scrum and the practices that make it up, right? That's kind of key. But I guess at a double advantage to that of the immersive class is that you can augment that story with how you're actually implementing it within your organization, right? So you can, although Martin's going to say this is how a product owner works, that's in a box. Here's the definition of product owner from scrum. 

Um, you're then perhaps going to go try some of those things inside of your organization and you're going to be like, "Oh, well this bit sucks and that bit sucks and we can't do this bit," and the organization says we're not allowed to do that. And then you can come back and we can tweak it, right? There's not one way to do scrum; you can tweak it to figure out how it is that it can be most effective within the context of your organization. So that's really the first one: that empirical understanding of the underlying principles of scrum and how they work. 

Um, the second one is probably that bit at the end, the getting started right. The, um, you know, the getting rid of the Klingons that have come into your process or, um, uh, you know, scraping the Klingons off the starboard bow, if anybody remembers that. 

Um, I may be too old; that's what it is. I'm going to be too old. But, uh, the also the getting started right. Lots of teams really struggle. We understand this scrum thing now. 

Like, what do I do? What's next? Um, and the advantage to the immersive classes is that's happening continuously throughout the class, right? Rather than you having a two-filled day or here's a week of training and then Monday we're doing something different and we don't know where to start, you get introduced to a little piece at a time. Try it within your organization a little piece at a time. Try to try it little piece, little piece, little piece. 

Um, so that's probably the second key takeaway. Man, what's the third? Third one? 

Um, probably learning what is not scrum, right? That, that I mentioned, like the Klingons, the things that are built up in our process. But there's also not just institutional knowledge within our organization, um, but institutional knowledge within our industry of what people think scrum is. So you'll have people who have done scrum in other organizations that also bring their Klingons and barnacles, right, to the story. 

Um, and when you mush that all together, you end up with something that perhaps doesn't look like scrum at all, doesn't have any empiricism, doesn't close any feedback loops, doesn't have working products at the end of every iteration. And that's fairly common, right? So being able to clearly understand what is and is not scrum so that you can choose the not, even if you're doing the core right. 

Um, and I think that's a huge key takeaway for the APS class.
