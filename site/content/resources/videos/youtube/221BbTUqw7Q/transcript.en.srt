1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,980
ah so three what are the three key

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,400
takeaways to attending the aps class

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,680
especially the immersive APS class

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
um so I think the the first one is that

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,000
fundamental understanding of the

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,279
underlying principles of uh of scrum and

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,680
ethereum practices that make it up right

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,500
that that's kind of kind of kind of key

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,739
but I guess at a double advantage to

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,600
that of the immersive class is that you

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,840
can

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,340
augment that story with how you're

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,280
actually implementing it within your

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,260
organization right so you can although

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,600
Martin's going to say this is how a

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,100
product owner works that's in a box

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,719
here's the definition of product owner

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,460
from from scrum

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,719
um you're then perhaps going to go try

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,160
some of those things inside of your

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,719
organization and you're gonna be like oh

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,100
well this bit sucks and that bit sucks

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,480
and we can't do this bit and the

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,879
organization says we're not allowed to

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,100
do that and then you can come back and

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,439
and we can we can tweak it right there's

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,700
not one way to do scrum you can tweak it

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
to figure out

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,720
um how it is that it can be most

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,939
effective within the context of your

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,580
organization so that's really the first

32
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,520
one that that empirical

33
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,460
um understanding of the underlying

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,600
principles of of scrum and how they work

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,700
um the second one is probably that that

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,000
bit that bit at the end the the getting

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,360
started right the the

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,840
um you know the the the the

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,439
getting rid of the the the Klingons that

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,960
have come into your process or

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
um uh you know scraping the Klingons off

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,020
the starboard bow if anybody remembers

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,060
that

44
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,500
um I may be too old that's what it is

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,220
I'm gonna be too old

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,619
but uh the the also the the getting

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,380
started right lots of teams really

48
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,299
struggle we understand this scrum thing

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,200
now

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,880
like what what do I do what's next

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
um and the advantage to the immersive

52
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,780
classes that's happening continuously

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,819
throughout the class right rather than

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,000
you having a two-filled day or here's a

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,020
week of training and then Monday we're

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
doing something different and we don't

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,220
know where to start you get introduced

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,720
to a little piece at a time try it

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,420
within your organization a little piece

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,580
at a time try to try it little piece

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,280
little piece little piece

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,220
um so that's that's probably the second

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,420
key takeaway man what's the third third

64
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,060
one

65
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,920
third superpower

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,680
um probably

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,519
um learning what is not scrum right that

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,160
that

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,019
I mentioned like the Klingons the things

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,300
that are are built up in our process but

71
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,879
there's also not just institutional

72
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,680
knowledge within our organization

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,680
um but institutional knowledge within

74
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,180
our industry of what people think scrum

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,340
is so you'll have people who have done

76
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,860
scrum organized other organizations that

77
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,660
also bring their Klingons and Barnacles

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,220
right to the story

79
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,200
um and when you mush that all together

80
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,000
you end up with something that perhaps

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,220
doesn't look like scrum at all doesn't

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,599
have any empiricism doesn't close any

83
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,940
feedback loops doesn't have working

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,360
products at the end of every iteration

85
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,620
and that's fairly common right so being

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:32,159
able to clearly understand what is and

87
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:36,599
is not scrum so that you can choose the

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,000
not even if you're doing the core right

89
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,680
um and I think that's that's a huge key

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,200
takeaway for

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,239
um the aps class
