The applying professional Cang course from Pro Caman is really that foundational class on understanding how to apply a cand strategy to your existing system. It doesn't really matter what your existing system is; you could be doing Scrum, you could be doing waterfall, you could be doing anything. Whatever process you've got right now is the process that you apply the Cang strategy to. 

This course's purpose is to help you understand what is needed in order to have a Cang strategy and what are some of the starting points, tools, and techniques you can use to get started with a cand strategy. What's the minimum you need to be doing Cang right? 

So, what are the minimum metrics we need to be collecting, visualisations we have to have, and decisions that we have to make in order for our continuous improvement to start happening? How do we start interpreting the graphs, start understanding the data, and analysing it in order to get better at whatever it is that we're doing? 

It really helps improve the flow of value through the system. It helps you get an idea of what your current flow is, and that helps you figure out how to ask more interesting questions of your team. If you want to have a discussion about your unique needs or situation, then please book a call or visit us at Naked Agility. 

We have our immersive and traditional public classes on our website, and we'd love to hear from you.
