    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on applying Kanban and workflow efficiency, with no meaningful reference to Objective Key Results or the OKR framework. There is no explicit connection to OKR structure, principles, or practices, making it a poor fit for this category.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of Agentic Engineering are absent; neither the term nor its philosophical context appears. Conceptually, some elements resonate with agentic goals—empowering teams with data-driven practices for improvement and value delivery—but the primary focus is on Kanban methods, metrics, and integration into existing workflows. The discussion is functional: improving efficiency, visualizing work, and fostering continuous improvement; there is no reference to decentralised decision-making, systemic observability at a deeper level, DevOps/engineering craft as agency, or ethical human-AI collaboration. Audience alignment is moderate as technical and practitioner audiences may overlap, but content lacks the depth, language, or focus on maximising human and AI agency, or the ethical and systemic dimensions required by the category. No significant tangential filler, but the key Agentic Engineering topics are not explored.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is centered on practical Kanban implementation and continuous improvement for workflow efficiency. While these overlap somewhat with agentic principles, the focus is not on deliberate engineering for maximising agency or integrating human/AI autonomy, making it a partial but weak fit for Agentic Engineering.",
