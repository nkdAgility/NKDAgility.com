# Why do you prefer agile consulting over agile coaching?

When companies make the transition from traditional #projectmanagement to #agile #productdevelopment, it often requires a lot of support in the form of an #agilecoach or #agileconsultant.

An #agileconsultant is typically a much shorter client engagement with a focus on helping the team get started, solve complex problems, and to make evolutions in each #sprint, whilst an #agilecoach tends to have a far longer client engagement with a focus on #coaching, #facilitation, and helping #agile teams develop their #agilecapability over a longer period of time.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about why he favours #agileconsulting engagements over #agilecoaching engagements.
