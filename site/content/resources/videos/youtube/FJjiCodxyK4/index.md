**Why do you prefer agile consulting over agile coaching?**

💡"Why do I gravitate towards Agile Consulting over Agile Coaching?"

This question pops up more often than a jack-in-the-box. Let's illuminate this topic and unearth the power of internal leadership and sustainable change. 🚀

## Leadership: The Core of Business Success

Leadership is the heart of any organisation, pumping energy and direction to all its parts. It's not just a role; it's the dynamo that pushes an organisation towards its goals. 🎯 Outsourcing leadership? That's like hiring a surrogate to run your marathon. 🏃‍♂️

Too often, external Agile Coaches step in, bridging the chasm between traditional and Agile leadership. And while this might work in the short term, it creates a crutch that hinders true growth. It's like training wheels that never come off. 🚴‍♀️

## Unshackling the Training Wheels

Imagine a software team battling a product riddled with issues. A complete rewrite seems like a solid plan, but hold your horses!

If the same team, with their ingrained habits and perspectives, embarks on the rewrite, chances are, the same issues will resurface.

The same can happen with Agile Coaches. Even the best coach can't spur true evolution if teams hold onto old ways. Unless individuals are ready to challenge their mindset, it's like rewriting code with the same bugs!

As an Agile Consultant, I prefer to come in for a brief stint, empowering the team to innovate and improve their processes. It's about sparking internal change and mindset shifts, not about being a long-term safety net. 💪🌱

## Riding the Budget Wave

Agile Coaches often face the chopping block in lean times, especially if organisations feel they're not getting bang for their buck. Once the coaches are gone, teams often revert to old practices, highlighting the transient change coaching sometimes brings. It's like a sandcastle washed away by the tide. 🌊

### The Agile Consultant's Promise

Here's what sets me apart as an Agile Consultant. I equip organisations with the tools, insights, and mindsets they need. Then I step back. They take the reins, learn from the journey, and drive the transformation. It's about creating self-reliant teams that don't need an external safety harness. 📈

### Balancing Act

My usual model is to work intensively for several weeks to a month, plant the seeds of transformation, and then transition to an advisory role. I provide value without creating dependency. This ensures the change is enduring, robust, and, above all, transformative. 🔥

So, that's why I champion Agile Consulting over Agile Coaching. I believe in sparking change and then passing the torch to the organisation to carry it forward.
