1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,059
oh that's a good question so the

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,320
question is why do I prefer agile

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,360
Consulting

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,940
over agile coaching

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,100
and for me it

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,100
I believe

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,779
the the leadership within your

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,359
organization

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,640
is a business critical function

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,500
right this this is not something that

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
you should be Outsourcing to somebody

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,600
else

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,280
and I feel like too many organizations

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,719
bring in coaches who are their

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,280
semi-filled time probably over a number

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,660
of years and those coaches are bringing

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,820
leadership to the organization they're

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,800
filling the gap between traditional

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,800
organizational leadership and agile

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,020
leadership and they become a crutch for

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,579
the people in the organization and the

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,520
people in the organization don't

23
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,379
actually learn to do things differently

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,180
um it's like for if you were to equate

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,820
it to software engineering it's like the

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,880
the mythical rewrite of a product right

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,979
you go rewrite the product but you don't

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,360
really realize that the people that

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,540
built

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,860
the crappy called coded product you have

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,479
right now with the same people that

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
you've got doing the rewrite and why

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,020
would you think it would be any

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,220
different right and it's this is exactly

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,720
the same thing you have the same people

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,540
in your organization so when those

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,400
coaches rotate off either because

38
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,680
budgets get constrained right because

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,420
that goes in fluctuations over the over

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,880
the the years we're in a budget

41
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,180
constrained environment right now

42
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,400
um and we're seeing big swathes of

43
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,320
organizations

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,079
divesting themselves of agile coaches

45
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,439
and scrum Masters mostly in the

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
Contracting space because

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,560
um they're they're not seeing the value

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,079
right they're not seeing the value

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
anymore and those people are leaving and

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,500
then the organization's falling back

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,140
into its old traditional practices

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,720
because there was no actual learning

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,119
taking place inside the organization

54
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,220
so the way I look at it is an agile

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,340
consultant's job

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,060
is to go in in a very short space of

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,800
time

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,860
help people in the organization

59
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,680
understand what they need to do and how

60
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,260
they need to change and work on their

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,300
mindsets and then they're the ones doing

62
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,220
the work they're the ones Taking It

63
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,280
Forward they're the ones cleaning up

64
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,660
their own mess and dealing with uh the

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,300
issues that are a result of their

66
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,980
decisions they're the ones learning

67
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,580
right

68
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,340
um so so then you've got that intrinsic

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,280
to the way your organization functions

70
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,599
now so when the agile consultant leaves

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,060
they're no longer that crutch right so a

72
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,340
normal engagement model for me is to to

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,459
only work full time with a team for for

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,959
a couple of weeks maybe a month tops I

75
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,000
think the longest engagement I did was

76
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,180
was three and a half weeks

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,420
um but then come back periodically

78
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,819
um and help with advice for for the

79
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,459
scrum Masters advice for leaders in the

80
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,040
organization have those constant touch

81
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,900
points where they're they're bringing me

82
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,540
some of their problems and I'm helping

83
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,540
them figure out other things to try

84
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,879
right that might might help resolve them

85
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,780
so that I'm not in full time I'm not

86
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,780
helping them full-time
