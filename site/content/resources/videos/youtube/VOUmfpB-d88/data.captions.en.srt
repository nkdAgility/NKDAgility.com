1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,560
so in addition to

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,559
our mentoring and Consulting programs we

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,759
also provide

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:14,519
training um the purpose of training is

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,840
to teach those

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,119
underlying um Theory and

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,279
principles with practices actionable

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:30,279
practices that people can use and that's

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:33,160
kind of why I do scrum.org based

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,559
training because

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:41,600
their philosophy around training is

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,000
about understanding the core Theory and

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,039
principles like here's the first

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
principles of what it is we're trying to

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,800
achieve um then building on top of that

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,960
here's the thing right so you're you're

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,079
you're learning the thing and then what

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,280
are the additional um processes and

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,079
practices complimentary processes and

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,600
practices that can use on top of that um

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,439
to do to do more to be to to to to get

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,759
the value out of it that people are

23
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,240
expecting to get and I one of the main

24
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,000
reasons I I I liked scrum.org was

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,799
because of that story because of the the

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,960
community of trainers the people that

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,320
that it gave me access to to discuss and

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,119
collaborate on how do we understand

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
these things how do we communicate these

30
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,360
things how do we enable them to to be as

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,399
effective as possible within uh uh

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,479
organizations um but the two-day

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,520
training format that was pre pandemic

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,000
was really good for the trainer right

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,719
because you fly in somewhere you do two

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,719
days training and then you fly out um

37
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,920
but not so good for the customer because

38
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,039
if you've got a bunch of people who are

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,039
struggling to deliver value right in

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,920
your organization and you spend two days

41
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,640
teaching them scrum where's the rest of

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,959
that story right if if if they're still

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,879
under pressure after that two-day class

44
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,720
then how how are they actually able to

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,000
do to do anything to action any of those

46
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,920
things and time goes by and then they've

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,319
forgotten most of what it is that

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,239
they've they've learned that's why I

49
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,319
think they say only 10% of of things you

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,160
learn in that format are actually stick

51
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:31,640
right so you put 20 people through the

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,200
class they all remember a different 10%

53
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,000
of the course cuz it's what matters to

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,440
them or impacts them they maybe

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,760
Implement 2% of that so you get a 2% net

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,959
gain um of Knowledge from that two-day

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,280
class but if we um change that format up

58
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,959
this is why we've moved um towards the

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,280
the the immersive learning format um and

60
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,239
incorporating it in a that story as well

61
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,360
into a bigger bigger Mentor program is

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,080
that um

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,159
even even if even if that 2% was all

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,319
that was

65
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,840
true you're then

66
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,959
2% compounded over multiple sessions

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,400
right so rather than having two full

68
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,640
days uh let's say we did eight half days

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,400
right so we've got eight half days over

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,599
a longer period of time and even if we

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,360
still got that 2% actionable change we

72
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,920
get 2% and then compound it with another

73
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,959
2% and then compound it with another 2%

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
because there's a gap in between and

75
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,080
there's an assignment for people to go

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,080
do inside the organization but I believe

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,120
that that format is a heck of a lot more

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,040
than remembering just a 10% because

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
we're only learning a couple of hours

80
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,640
worth of stuff we're not learning 16

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
hours worth of stuff and then you have

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,519
to try and remember a percentage of that

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,640
16 hours we're

84
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,159
remembering from that two hours worth of

85
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,159
stuff that we've we we've researched and

86
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,760
talked about and collaborated on to

87
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,400
understand that teaching part and then

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,799
they have to go and try and apply

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,959
something in that context within their

90
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,439
organization and yes everybody's going

91
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,000
to learn still going to learn something

92
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,959
different people are all going to retain

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,639
different things but even if it was

94
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,280
again just learning the 10% it's 10% of

95
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,680
two hours plus 10% of two hours plus 10%

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,759
of two hours so the end percentage for

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,479
the same learning content is is much

98
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,000
more powerful much more effective like s

99
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,759
orders of magnitude uh uh more effective

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,960
for

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,039
organizations and because they get the

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,680
assignment to go try and do things

103
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,520
within their

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,560
organization um during that time they've

105
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,919
also provided actionable value for the

106
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,479
organization so think of it like that

107
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,919
iterative process in scrum where we we

108
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,800
do a Sprint and then we deliver usable

109
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,160
working product we've got a a learning

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
exercise then at the end of that

111
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
learning exercise they go deliver usable

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
working product within the organization

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,720
they just need to figure out what is the

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,560
use you know we give them an assignment

115
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,919
but it's it can be quite vague right we

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,440
give them lots of different ways to

117
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,479
resolve that assignment um they pick

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,120
something they try it in the

119
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,960
organization they've made a change that

120
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,080
change either was successful or it

121
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,400
wasn't it was either able to be

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,280
implemented or it hit a roadblock and

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,520
then we come when we come back around

124
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,400
we're able to um

125
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,319
debrief that activity that they did so

126
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:43,199
they then get feedback and engagement

127
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,560
closing that feedback loop right on how

128
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,680
you know what did you manage to change

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,400
how effective was it in your

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,880
organization what roadblocks do you hit

131
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,199
how do you get past those roadblocks

132
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
what have other people tried and even

133
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,840
especially when you you put a big group

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,720
through that within your

135
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,080
organization you you even get

136
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,319
cross-pollination and cross learning

137
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
because one person or one group within

138
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,039
the bigger group says we weren't able to

139
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,199
do that because this doesn't work in our

140
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,199
organization and the other groups like

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,880
well actually we were a we were able to

142
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,759
speak to this person and this person and

143
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,120
get this to happen so we were able to do

144
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,039
this which got us halfway there and that

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,319
cross-pollination and learning is hugely

146
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,120
important to that to that story and and

147
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,039
it works great across organizations as

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
well when you have multiple

149
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,240
organizations participating so that

150
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
that's moving towards that immersive

151
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,039
format so we kind of started in the

152
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,800
two-day format we then moved into the

153
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,280
four half day format then into the 8we

154
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:44,199
immersive format and now moving into the

155
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,240
the the kind of more Mentor program uh

156
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:51,520
maybe over over well from from eight to

157
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,160
50 weeks right of of that program um

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,400
with sessions and workshops and

159
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,840
different things going on I think

160
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,759
um this is the game Cher for

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,560
organizations because we're not just

162
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,759
giving you the information we're

163
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,680
collaborating and working with you to

164
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,280
help you implement it over a longer

165
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,280
period of time
