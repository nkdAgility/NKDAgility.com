## **The Shift from Traditional to Immersive Learning**

In the world of Agile and Scrum, training is not just about passing on knowledge‚Äîit's about creating real, actionable change in organizations. Our approach has evolved significantly, from traditional two-day workshops to a more engaging and practical immersive learning format. This shift is crucial for achieving lasting transformation in organizations.

### **Why Traditional Training Falls Short**

The traditional **two-day training format** served a purpose pre-pandemic. It was efficient for trainers:

- Fly in

- Teach for two days

- Fly out

But there was a problem. It wasn't effective for the participants. Imagine a team struggling to deliver value in their organization. A two-day crash course in Scrum might give them a good foundation, but what happens after that?

- **Retention Issues:** Participants tend to remember only about 10% of what they learn in these workshops.

- **Application Challenges:** When they return to their daily work, the pressure is still on, and much of the training fades into the background.

- **Minimal Impact:** Out of a room of 20 participants, each remembers a different 10%‚Äîand maybe 2% of that knowledge gets put into practice.

So, what's the solution? We needed a new approach.

## **Introducing the Immersive Learning Format**

### **What Is Immersive Learning?**

The **immersive learning format** isn't just about delivering content; it's about creating opportunities for participants to apply what they learn directly in their work environments. This new approach breaks down the learning into shorter, more focused sessions. Instead of two full days, we offer:

- **Eight half-day sessions** over an extended period.

- **Assignments** that participants can apply directly within their organization.

- **Collaborative debriefs** to discuss successes, challenges, and roadblocks.

### **The Benefits of Immersive Learning**

This format offers several advantages over the traditional model:

1. **Compounded Learning** üìà
    - In the traditional format, participants might retain 10% of the training content.
    
    - With immersive learning, they retain 10% of each session, and this knowledge builds over time.
    
    - The result? A **compounding effect** that leads to deeper understanding and greater practical application.

3. **Hands-On Practice** üõ†Ô∏è
    - After each session, participants get assignments to try out in their organization.
    
    - This hands-on experience ensures that learning isn't just theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs directly applicable to their unique challenges.

5. **Continuous Feedback Loop** üîÑ
    - After trying out their assignments, participants return to debrief.
    
    - They share what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and receive feedback.
    
    - This **feedback loop** is key to refining their approach and overcoming challenges.

### **Real-World Impact: A Personal Example**

When I first transitioned to the **scrum.org-based training**, I was drawn to their philosophy: focus on the underlying theory and principles of Scrum, then build on that with complementary practices. This approach allowed me to collaborate with a community of trainers, refining how we teach and support organizations.

But the two-day format had its limitations. I remember a client who struggled to implement Scrum after a two-day session. Despite their enthusiasm, the knowledge from the class was difficult to retain under the pressure of day-to-day responsibilities. They needed more support to apply what they had learned.

That's when I began offering **immersive learning**. Instead of a single, overwhelming session, we spread the content over multiple weeks. The client not only retained more but also started seeing real change in how their teams delivered value. They could focus on small, iterative improvements, much like how we run Sprints in Scrum.

## **From Two Days to Fifty Weeks: The Evolution of Training Programs**

### **Step-by-Step Transformation**

1. **Two-Day Format**: Effective for trainers but limited in retention and real-world impact.

3. **Four Half-Day Format**: Better retention, but still lacked depth in application.

5. **Eight Half-Day Sessions**: Introduced the concept of assignments, compounding knowledge and practical experience.

7. **Mentor Program (8-50 Weeks)**: A complete transformation, offering extended support, workshops, and tailored guidance.

### **The Game-Changer for Organizations**

Why is this longer, more immersive format a game-changer?

- **Sustainable Change**: Instead of a one-time burst of knowledge, participants receive ongoing support over weeks or months.

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Working with peers, they share insights and solutions, creating a culture of continuous learning.

- **Cross-Organization Learning**: When multiple organizations participate, the cross-pollination of ideas can spark innovation and creativity.

### **Practical Application: Iteration in Learning**

Think of the immersive learning format as an **iterative process**, similar to how we run Sprints in Scrum:

1. **Learn**: Participants engage in a focused session, diving deep into key concepts.

3. **Apply**: They take assignments back to their organizations, implementing changes in real-world settings.

5. **Review**: In the next session, we discuss their experiences, what worked, and what didn‚Äôt.

7. **Improve**: With feedback, participants adjust their approach and try again.

This iterative cycle ensures that learning is always tied to action, making it far more effective than traditional methods.

## **Building a Culture of Continuous Learning**

### **Creating Value Beyond the Classroom**

The ultimate goal of any training program should be to **deliver real value** to the organization. With the immersive format, participants aren't just passive learners; they're active contributors to their organization's success.

- **Immediate Impact**: Assignments are designed to create value right away. For example, one group might implement a new way of managing their daily stand-ups, while another experiments with a different approach to backlog refinement.

- **Overcoming Roadblocks**: When participants face challenges, they bring them back to the group. We explore how others have navigated similar issues, offering diverse perspectives and solutions.

- **Cross-Functional Insights**: Even within a single organization, different teams have unique approaches to problem-solving. Sharing these insights helps break down silos and fosters collaboration.

### **Success Stories: The Power of Iterative Learning**

In one of our recent programs, a participant struggled with gaining stakeholder buy-in for changes they wanted to implement. After discussing their roadblocks in a session, they learned from another participant who had successfully engaged a key decision-maker by framing the change as a small experiment rather than a sweeping transformation. Inspired by this approach, they adapted it, secured buy-in, and saw immediate improvements in team engagement.

This kind of **cross-pollination** is one of the most powerful aspects of immersive learning. It allows participants to learn not only from their trainers but from each other, accelerating growth and success.

## **Final Thoughts: Why Immersive Learning Is the Future of Scrum Training**

The shift to immersive learning isn't just about longer training programs‚Äîit's about **transforming how we learn and apply Scrum**. By focusing on:

- **Compounding Knowledge**

- **Hands-On Practice**

- **Collaborative Learning**

We create a training environment that is more aligned with the core principles of Agile and Scrum. It‚Äôs not just about learning the theory; it‚Äôs about **living it, experimenting with it, and adapting it** to meet the unique needs of every organization. If you're ready to take your Scrum practice to the next level, it's time to embrace the power of immersive learning. Let‚Äôs move beyond the two-day workshops and start creating lasting change, one iteration at a time. üß†üöÄ
