# NKD Agility Training Approach

There's an old saying, 'those who can't teach', and we are deeply aware of why that is. That said, it isn't mastery unless the technique or outcomes can be reproduced by others, and that's the difference between teaching and training.

NKD Agility are deeply committed to nurturing and growing the next generation of skilled, competent Agile practitioners that are able to navigate complexity and thrive despite uncertainty in product development environments around the world.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood - Principal Agile Consultant and Professional Scrum Trainer - walks us through the NKD Agility approach to training and mentoring.
