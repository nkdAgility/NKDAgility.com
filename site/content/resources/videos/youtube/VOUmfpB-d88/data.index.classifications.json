While it discusses delivering 'value' and better impact for organizations, it does not explicitly focus on measuring or driving customer outcomes as defined in the category. Feedback loops, iterative improvement, and practical application are well-explored, with some indirect references to value, yet all examples remain at an internal training or team level rather than directly anchoring product development to customer value or outcomes. The piece targets practitioners, offering actionable strategies, but lacks explicit alignment to measuring, validating, or prioritizing customer needs as required for full classification in Customer Focus.",

There is no explicit or implicit discussion of Collective Intelligence as defined (joint human-AI teamwork for enhanced outcomes).

The content centers on immersive learning in Scrum, describing formats, feedback loops, and experiential training rather than goal-setting frameworks, outcome-based measurement, or strategic alignment via OKRs. The closest connections are generic references to outcomes such as 'delivering value,' iterative learning, and continuous improvement, but these are tied strictly to Scrum training—not the OKR framework. No authority on OKRs is cited, no stretch goals, key results, or OKR-driven alignment is discussed. The core audience (Scrum/Agile practitioners) overlaps slightly but the focus is on training methodology. As such, alignment, depth, and signal are minimal, with the confidence almost entirely based on faint conceptual overlap in iterative improvement language—insufficient for the category.",
