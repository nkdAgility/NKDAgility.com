1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,359
one of the main ways to wreck your

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,400
campign strategy is is not agreeing how

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,480
you're going to work as a team right

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,600
unless you've you've sat down with the

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,680
people you're going to work with and

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,080
decided on how are we going to approach

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,080
things we probably don't have agreement

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:30,080
right most people um unless you sit down

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,920
and agree are probably not on the same

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,280
page we don't have all of our nosies

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
pointed in the same direction right

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,039
we're

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,360
we I might pick things based on um their

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:44,559
Affinity to something I like you might

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,440
pick things based on their Affinity to

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,640
something you like and

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,600
suddenly we're what from the outside it

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,879
looks like we're randomly picking stuff

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,879
to work on right

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:06,400
um that that working agreement

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:09,040
is so often missing uh from

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,960
teams for some

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,320
reason lots of people think that you can

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,320
just throw 10 people together and

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,759
they'll magically figure out how to

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,000
navigate the complex nature of of

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,799
delivering high value complex products

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,040
and be able to just figure it

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,520
out and they also think that you can

30
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,040
just apply some

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,960
framework and if we all follow that

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,079
we'll also all be in in in agreement so

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,560
for example scrum right we have a a

34
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:45,360
caman strategy um we're going to do

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,399
we're going to do scrum as part of that

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,799
that's that's we're going to create a

37
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,399
bounded environment we're going to do

38
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,880
all those things and um scrum is going

39
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,600
to solve all of our problems that's our

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,280
working agreement no it's not it's not

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,680
your working agreement at all scrum is a

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,039
framework it's not not uh blowby blow

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,479
how to do stuff are you going to use

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,079
story points are you going to use

45
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,759
planning poker those are not part of

46
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,360
scrum they're optional things that you

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,360
might pick have you decided to do those

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,200
things if you're if you're not doing

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,560
scrum you might just have 10 people who

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,599
all want to work a slightly different

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,440
way working together towards some

52
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:29,080
outcome so I would say to you if I if I

53
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,560
took one of my lovely board games to my

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,599
board game group I'll will be there

55
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,760
tonight at playing if I took one and we

56
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,879
didn't we all we we got the pieces out I

57
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,800
don't know if you've seen these things

58
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,360
but they have like 300 pieces in the box

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
right um we got all the pieces out of

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,239
the

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,840
box uh I set it up the way I think it

62
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,000
looks like it should be set up so I'm

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,120
not going to look at the rules I'm just

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,800
going to make some stuff up and then

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,280
every member that's playing all all all

66
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,720
four of us uh make up our own rules for

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,400
how to play the game we don't read the

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,879
official rules we just do it our own

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:16,200
way are we working together are

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:21,239
we playing the same game right you can't

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,640
have a win you can't have success unless

72
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,920
you've agreed what the rules are for

73
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,760
Success right most of these games it's

74
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,159
the most points right but have you

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,720
agreed how you get points can I just

76
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,439
move a piece to here and say now I have

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,280
300 points

78
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:44,640
that's total disorder that's total

79
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:48,840
disarray and most teams that I see and

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,959
engage with operate in a state of total

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,400
disarray because they've not agreed what

82
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,760
their rules are they've not agreed what

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,400
game they're playing what success looks

84
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,920
like how they get H little successes

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,120
within the context of the bigger

86
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,920
successes that the organization's trying

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,000
to achieve so sit down with your team

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,400
and

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,840
agree The Way Forward don't tell you

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,519
need to agree because if you tell me how

91
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,400
to do the stuff that I do I'm going to

92
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,680
ignore you I need to be in agreement

93
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,680
with you you need to collaborate on

94
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,199
creating that definition of workflow we

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,199
need to collaborate on creating our

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,000
working agreement and it actually

97
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,280
doesn't matter whether you have a c I

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,320
don't care if you're doing if you're

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,919
doing caman if you're doing a caman

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,600
strategy caman method scrum doesn't

101
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,560
matter what it is if you've got a bunch

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,160
of people working together you need to

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,840
get together and agree how you're going

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,600
to work otherwise you have disarray

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,600
everybody's making it up as they go

106
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,320
along don't do that if you're struggling

107
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,000
to implement a cand strategy we can help
