It explicitly mentions Scrum and Kanban, aligning well with the core themes of the category. The depth of discussion is significant, as it elaborates on the consequences of not having a working agreement and uses analogies to illustrate the point. However, while it touches on these methodologies, it does not delve deeply into their specific frameworks or principles, which slightly lowers the confidence score.",
