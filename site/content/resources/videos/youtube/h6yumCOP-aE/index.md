# 3 best ways to wreck your Kanban adoption. Not having a working agreement.

Crafting Success: The Power of Team Agreements in Kanban

The Foundation of Effective Collaboration

The cornerstone of any successful Kanban or agile strategy is not the methodology itself but the team's agreement on how to work together. Without a shared understanding and explicit agreement, teams can easily fall into disarray, with each member pulling in different directions based on individual preferences rather than a unified strategy.

The Pitfalls of Assumed Agreement

Lack of Direction: Without a clear, agreed-upon approach, team members may select tasks based on personal interest rather than strategic value, leading to a lack of cohesion and direction.
Misconception of Frameworks: Merely adopting Scrum or any other framework without a detailed working agreement does not guarantee alignment. These frameworks provide structure, not solutions.
The Danger of Vanity Metrics: Relying on superficial metrics like story points or planning poker without a consensus on their use and value can lead to misguided efforts and ineffective measurement of progress.
Building a Winning Strategy
Explicit Working Agreements: Sit down as a team to decide on your approach, tools, and methods. This agreement forms the basis of your collaborative efforts and ensures everyone is aligned towards common goals.
Define Success: Clearly outline what success looks like for your team and how it aligns with the organization's objectives. This includes defining small wins that contribute to larger goals.
Customize Your Approach: Whether you're implementing Kanban, Scrum, or a hybrid strategy, the key is to adapt the methodology to fit your team's unique needs and agree on the best practices that will guide your work.

Collaboration Over Dictation

Joint Decision-Making: Imposing methods and tools top-down without team buy-in is a recipe for resistance and inefficiency. Collaboration and consensus-building lead to a more cohesive and motivated team.
Iterative Improvement: Your working agreement is not set in stone. Regularly review and adjust your strategies based on feedback and changing circumstances to continuously refine your workflow.
