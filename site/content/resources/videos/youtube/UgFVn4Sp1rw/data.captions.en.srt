1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,000
so if you're Building Products you

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,760
really need to

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,960
understand the cost of those

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,639
products so there are a number

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,039
of it's it's really complicated because

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,600
there's there's the actual cost you pay

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,279
which is normally

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,119
due in general your two big costs at

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,960
building software products is Hardware

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,160
that's the smaller one hardware and

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,840
people right so if you have uh 50 people

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,280
working on a product that's probably

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,280
going to be your biggest cost if you

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,399
deploy to the cloud that's going to be

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,520
your second biggest cost right so your

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,520
infrastructure infrastructure and people

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,160
those costs should be fairly

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,520
consistent so you you should understand

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,079
your cost profile I talk usually talk

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,239
about it it's what's the cost per Sprint

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,039
right why should we do another Sprint

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,399
what's it going to cost what do we

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,079
getting for it and are we getting a

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,040
clear return on investment for the cost

25
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,680
that we're we're we're putting in right

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,680
so H Sprints are part of the scrum

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,720
framework and they're a way of planning

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,720
and managing work right so the the the

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,439
the they don't imply an Engineering

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,040
Process it's just about the the the

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,040
management of the work part and planning

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,520
for for what's happening next so if I

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,119
was looking at a cost per Sprint let's

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,240
say I'm doing a twoe Sprint what's my

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,840
cost per two weeks of of work what are

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,040
my teams working on for those two weeks

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,280
and is it valuable it's also really

38
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,640
important in that context for the people

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,640
doing the work to understand the cost of

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,360
doing the work because they'll make

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,680
better choices right if if if you you

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,799
want to create an environment within

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,840
which people are spending the money as

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,560
if it's their money and if they

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,799
understand the cost of the Sprint

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,159
they'll think about what is it that

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,719
we're doing for this Sprint the cost of

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,679
the Sprint and try and maximize your

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,239
return on investment that needs to be an

50
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,200
evolution an effort that every single

51
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,519
person that's working on your product is

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
involved in otherwise you're not going

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,920
to have people working on the right

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,840
thing you're not going to have people

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,560
making the right decisions so so one one

56
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,840
way one effective way

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:34,160
to minimize your cost and maximize your

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:36,519
value is to have every member of every

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,680
team and everybody working on your

60
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,519
product understand what the costs are

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,720
within their context I I I actually I

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
I've spoken to some colleagues about

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
this and I've kind of come to the

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,840
conclusion that every team should be

65
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,360
running a

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,760
p&l right what not just not

67
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,879
just are we adding value in the product

68
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,519
because cuz value is a little

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,680
bit Eye of the Beholder it can be a

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
little bit difficult to to to actually

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,519
measure its

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,959
capability but Revenue we we can we can

73
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,799
absolutely measure that and what

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,280
percentage of the revenue is attributed

75
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,440
to a particular feature and this team

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,319
owns that feature therefore that's the

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,000
revenue they're making this is the cost

78
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,080
that they're they're they're having and

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,599
are we making a are we as a team making

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,480
a profit working on what we're working

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,760
on and if we're not making a profit

82
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,840
working on what we're working on should

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,400
be we working on something else right

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,840
that that that that Dynamic e and flow

85
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,319
of the team team within the context of

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,560
of teams to work within the context of

87
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,840
product management and product

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,360
leadership with deliberate choices on

89
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,080
investment in long-term efforts right

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,000
just like H an infrastructure build if

91
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,959
you were if you were running running

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,599
running a country and you decide to

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,840
invest in roads um that's a big capital

94
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,920
expenditure um to invest and that needs

95
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,079
that needs to be understood as a concept

96
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,920
as a as a as a as a a we're we're

97
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,680
investing a bunch of money just now so

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,480
it looks like we're making a loss in

99
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,319
order to get a larger return in the

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,879
future and that's a deliberate thing

101
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,799
that we're doing and but we're still

102
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,840
looking at the p&l we're still

103
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,320
understanding uh what it is that we're

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,560
we're doing so I I think from a from a

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,360
team from a group from a product

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,800
perspective we should be looking at all

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,800
of that information and every member of

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,280
every team should under understand it to

109
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,360
the extent that they need to right

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,360
within their within their

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,160
context and to do that you kind of do

112
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,720
need to understand a little bit more

113
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,400
about what your product is where you

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,520
intend your product to go what Market

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,320
you're in what's happening in the market

116
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,759
and how you're interacting with the

117
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,039
market and this is where I tend to fall

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,759
back a little bit on evidence-based

119
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,720
management so there's the evidence-based

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,639
management guide from scrum.org

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,360
and it it it doesn't I mean it does give

122
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,880
example metrics right but it doesn't

123
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,160
really talk about specific metrics in in

124
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,520
the context of the guide it basically

125
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,520
says there's four key value areas that

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,919
we need to think about there's four key

127
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,639
questions we need to ask ourselves and

128
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,360
in order to answer those questions we

129
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,639
need to have metrics which help inform

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
but not control those decisions so the

131
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,720
four the four key value areas that we

132
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,400
need to need to

133
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,000
monitor right in order to understand our

134
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,440
cost to Value profile I think that's

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,800
probably a good way to say it is we need

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,919
to understand where we sit in the market

137
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,960
for our product and that that market

138
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,960
could be an external b2c B2B Market or

139
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,880
it could be an internal what you call an

140
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,240
internal Market B2B

141
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,240
b2c eye to eye internal to internal I

142
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,240
don't know whatever you want to call

143
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,880
that but you you you

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,400
you're the people that are using your

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,720
your your your your product internally

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,479
in the organization that's why lots of

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,120
organizations have inter internal cost

148
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,840
structures as well you know I worked at

149
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,360
mer Lynch and if I wanted a a server or

150
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,880
use a piece of software even if it was

151
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,120
an internally built piece of software

152
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,479
that was a cost attributed to it and yes

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,199
it was a little bit of a fictitious

154
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,440
internal cost but it allowed them to do

155
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,240
a little bit more p&l and understand uh

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,160
what's going on with the the the product

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,199
they they definitely went too far bean

158
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,360
counter but it is it is it is important

159
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,960
but so we have to understand our our our

160
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,199
market value and that's made up of two

161
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,960
two areas there's current market value

162
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,840
what we've got right now what we're

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,479
delivering right now so that could be

164
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,919
customer happiness it could be employee

165
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,560
happiness it could be usage right lots

166
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,440
of information we can collect around our

167
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,599
current value and then we've got um HP

168
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,000
hypothetical value future value which

169
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
should be represented in our product

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,280
backlog right what's the future value of

171
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,280
our product and looking at

172
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,759
what Market opportunities we can open

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,160
and how do we measure whether we're

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,000
opening enough market opportunities

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,440
think of the example of of of of Netflix

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,879
why do they why do they choose to create

177
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,479
a new show first season of a new show

178
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,560
rather than at a second season to an

179
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,440
existing already success successful show

180
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,759
and that's because second Seasons always

181
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,360
have less users less people care about a

182
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,280
second season whereas first season of a

183
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,599
new show you

184
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,960
can big it up and on board new people

185
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,280
that weren't customers before right so

186
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,080
that's opening out New Market

187
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,199
opportunities rather than leveraging

188
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,520
existing Market opportunities and that's

189
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,319
what your product backlogs about right

190
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,960
so you need to measure and understand

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,960
those things within that context and

192
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,720
those things are really really hard to

193
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,080
measure that's one of the hardest parts

194
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,479
I think to to to to measure for most

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,360
most organizations are we solving

196
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,800
customers problems are there other

197
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,120
problems that the customers have that we

198
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,840
should be solving instead all of those

199
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,520
those kind of kind of questions but

200
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,319
that's that's your market value and then

201
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,400
the other thing that you need to

202
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,520
understand and have metrics and I'm I'm

203
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,639
deliberately

204
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,039
not I'm referring to metrics but not

205
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,200
specifically saying you need to use

206
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,479
specific metrics because it really

207
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,440
depends on your your your context your

208
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,000
industry what it is you're doing how

209
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,440
your product works you need to find

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,159
metrics in these areas that suit your

211
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,920
particular product in your particular

212
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,600
world I do work with organizations to

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,320
help them understand those things but

214
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,560
it's something that that they need to

215
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,480
understand right the people doing the

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,839
work the people in the organization need

217
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
to understand so that's the

218
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,279
market value and then you've also got

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,680
your your cap ability of your

220
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,560
organization so the two the two pieces

221
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,320
are are time to Market how quickly do

222
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,320
you get your product in front of real

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,240
customers right time to Market is about

224
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,240
how quickly can you realize an idea to

225
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,000
to to

226
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
data right so that's time to Market and

227
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,800
then the other one is ability to

228
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,920
innovate how much time do you spend

229
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,519
opening those new markets versus

230
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,959
maintaining and supporting existing

231
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,800
stuff right and this is where if you had

232
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,640
high technical debt you might spend more

233
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,240
time on maintaining and supporting if

234
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,360
you have low product quality you might

235
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,959
have more time on uh supporting

236
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,560
maintaining so those are the types of

237
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,600
things you might measure in in in that

238
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,160
world right what's our what's our our

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,399
technical debt we might do so in our

240
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,480
Cube analysis of our or our code base of

241
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,880
our product or whatever else you're

242
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,360
doing how do we understand like bug

243
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Trends Liv site incidents we might be

244
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,160
looking at all of those things within

245
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
our ability to innovate context and our

246
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,920
time to Market we're looking at cycle

247
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,680
time and lead time right how quickly can

248
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,680
we get stuff out the door and what are

249
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,160
other things in your

250
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,399
organization that impact on those ideas

251
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,640
right what are the things that inhibit

252
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,519
your organization's ability to reduce it

253
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,600
time to Market measure

254
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,880
those right to get faster at delivering

255
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,360
your products what are the things that

256
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,560
are getting in your way that's what you

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
should measure if you're if you're

258
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,920
struggling to innovate what are the

259
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,440
things that are getting in your way

260
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
those are the the things you'd measure

261
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,360
right and once you've got a handle on

262
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,720
those things figure out what the next

263
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,720
thing you measure is to get your next

264
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,360
biggest bang for your buck and that's a

265
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,600
constant cycle so the metrics are

266
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,880
changing um over time some of them will

267
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,880
take longer than others to resolve but

268
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,079
measuring and

269
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,519
monitoring value that you're creating

270
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,000
Revenue in

271
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,160
p&l and the cost of delivering in your

272
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
product these other metrics that help

273
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,639
you get that holistic picture of what's

274
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,040
going on it is almost the most important

275
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:08,399
thing uh for a CTO for a business to

276
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,720
understand and disseminate through the

277
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,480
organization so that we can all at every

278
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,480
level make the best decision we can
