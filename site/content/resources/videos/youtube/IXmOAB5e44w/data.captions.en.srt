1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,700
so we have a we have a 20 referral

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,460
program

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,680
and the reason I created it was because

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,180
I thought it was a good idea

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,900
to effectively reward people for

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,779
um

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,740
having a bringing other people to the

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,740
classes right uh quite often

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,980
um it's it's difficult

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,660
to get your friends to come along to the

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,820
classes our colleagues in your

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,620
organization friends or colleagues to

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,000
help participate together so that you

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,739
can learn together and move forward

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,399
together in the organization

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,320
uh so I created this referral program

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,399
where

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,680
um you

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,800
the person you you can go to my website

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,260
and you can get this code right and the

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,980
code allows you to give it to somebody

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,379
else and they will get a 20 discount on

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,580
any class right hopefully it's the one

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,960
that you're going to be on as well so

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,580
you can collaborate together in your

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,439
organization or maybe you go on

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,479
different classes and pull the knowledge

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,760
right that's cool too

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,380
um but you also get something for it

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,299
right not only does this other person

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,100
get a 20 discount but you get a 20 store

32
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,479
credit that's probably the best way to

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,159
describe it

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,740
um you get 20 of the fee that they paid

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,979
uh in credit towards a future future

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,560
class so in effect uh if you think about

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,079
it because it's 20 if they're all in the

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,820
same Market you refer five people you're

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
probably getting a class for free right

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,400
it's probably pretty close to that

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,140
um so this enables you to get something

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,420
out of it as well

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,280
um and the more people you refer the

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,520
more the more the more cash is in that

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,020
pool the more classes you can take

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,380
um

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,020
yeah I think that's a a great way to

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,240
reward people who who like my training

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,420
or who want to bring other people in

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,340
