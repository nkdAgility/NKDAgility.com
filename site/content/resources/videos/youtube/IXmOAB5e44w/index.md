I’m excited to share with you a new initiative that I believe will not only enhance your learning experience but also foster a sense of community within our classes. Introducing the **£20 Referral Program**—a simple yet effective way to reward you for bringing your friends and colleagues along on this journey of growth and development.

### Why a Referral Program?

Let’s face it: getting your friends or colleagues to join you in a class can sometimes feel like pulling teeth. We all know the benefits of learning together—sharing insights, collaborating on challenges, and ultimately moving forward as a cohesive unit within our organisations. That’s why I thought it was high time we created a system that encourages this collaborative spirit.

### How It Works

Here’s the lowdown on how the referral program operates:

- **Get Your Code**: Head over to my website, where you can easily obtain your unique referral code.
- **Share the Love**: Pass this code on to someone you think would benefit from attending a class. When they use it, they’ll receive a **£20 discount** on their class fee.
- **Earn Rewards**: But it doesn’t stop there! For every person who signs up using your code, you’ll receive **£20 in store credit** towards future classes. 

### The Benefits

This program is designed to be mutually beneficial:

- **Collaborative Learning**: By inviting others to join you, you can learn together, share experiences, and deepen your understanding of the material.
- **Cost-Effective**: If you refer five people, you could potentially earn enough credit to attend a class for free! Imagine the possibilities of expanding your knowledge without the financial burden.
- **Community Building**: This initiative not only rewards you but also helps build a community of learners who are eager to grow and support one another.

### Why This Matters

In my experience, the most impactful learning occurs in a collaborative environment. When you engage with others, you not only gain different perspectives but also create a network of support that can be invaluable in your professional journey. This referral program is my way of encouraging that spirit of collaboration and making it easier for you to bring others along for the ride.

### Join the Movement

I genuinely believe that this referral program will enhance your learning experience and help you build a stronger network within your organisation. If you’re interested in participating, simply visit my website to get your referral code and start sharing it with your colleagues and friends.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with me. If you have any questions or want to discuss this further, feel free to reach out. I’m always here to chat about Agile, Scrum, DevOps, or anything else on your mind. And don’t forget to like, follow, and subscribe for more updates!

Let’s learn and grow together!
