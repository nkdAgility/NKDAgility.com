# Referral program. 20% of the course fee credited to your account.

We're blessed to have so many people coming through our NKD Agility doors because of a referral, and we deeply value and appreciate those referrals.

So much so, that we've created a referral program that benefits both you and the person you are referring to the tune of 20% of the course fee. That's right, 20%

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how the referral program works, why it's super popular, and how you can take advantage of it.
