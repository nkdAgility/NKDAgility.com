1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,640
as your devops was built for agile teams

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,679
by agile teams but there are many ways

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,960
you can use it to support your agile

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,200
practices here I'll show you how to use

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,120
as your devops to support your scrum

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,160
process from the perspective of

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,640
scrum.org and the teams at Microsoft

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,000
that created it the focus will be on

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,800
using the scrum framework coupled with

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,519
value focused hypothesis driven

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,519
flow-based

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
practices

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,920
[Music]

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,280
hi I'm Martin Henwood owner and

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,000
principal consultant at naked agility

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,559
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,399
scrum.org a professional camand trainer

18
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,520
with Pro camand and I've been a

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,060
Microsoft MVP in GitHub and aure devops

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,600
for 15

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,960
[Music]

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,320
years would it surprise you that there

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,000
are no metrics in the scrum guide would

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,640
it further surprise you if there were no

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,240
user stories story points planning poker

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,799
or burndown charts that were part of

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,280
scrum these are and always we optional

28
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,000
practices that many people found value

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,640
in their way of working but that you

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,520
don't have to

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,360
have just because you use a tool or

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,040
practice in a previous context doesn't

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,600
mean that it will fit a future context

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,680
the practices that you use and how you

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
use a tool to support your team's

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,040
practice practices and behaviors will

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
add or detract from achieving the

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,079
outcome and impact that you're trying to

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,720
achieve scrum is just a container for

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,880
other practices which can be helpful or

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,920
unhelpful I'm generally pedantic when

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,840
teaching and pragmatic when implementing

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,880
so everything you see here would be

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,560
guidance based on the common cause not

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,159
just rules to follow with some

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,840
pragmatism for Azure devops he's own

47
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,399
idioms

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,240
it's important to realize that everyone

49
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,640
and every team will have dumb ideas that

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
sound good at the start the most

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,360
effective teams are the ones that are

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,040
able to let go of an idea when they find

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,800
that the evidence does not support it so

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,519
let's take a look at how we can use

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,280
Azure devops within the context of

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,519
professional scrum for teams that build

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,400
software

58
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,959
products so in order to

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,720
understand

60
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,519
how I've got this set up in aure devops

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,879
we're going to take a look at how Azure

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,319
devops constructs what it is we're going

63
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,800
to be looking at so in as your devops

64
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,560
you have a an organization you can see

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
my list of organizations on the left

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,040
hand side here and inside of each

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,200
organization you have a set of projects

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,239
so here's a number of uh projects that I

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,319
have listed when you create a new

70
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,400
project you uh are able to select uh

71
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:04,560
what process process to use now I've got

72
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,440
a bunch of custom processes here uh to

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,920
select from I've created one based on

74
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,599
the scrum guide here which I'm going to

75
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,560
show you a project that's created with

76
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,640
that one um and the way that's

77
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,879
constructed you will all be able to see

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,760
this even if you can't edit it but if

79
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,239
you open the organizational settings on

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:31,239
the bottom left and go to um

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,879
process process you'll then see a of all

82
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,159
of the processes that are available so

83
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,360
out of the box um there are core

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,040
processes of basic agile scrum and CMI

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,599
those ones are locked you can't edit

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,400
them uh but you can create inherited

87
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,360
processes you H createed process based

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,720
on it and this one here I'm actually

89
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,120
going to make that one the default CU

90
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
that should be the default set as

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,159
default process is my custom process

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,319
that I've created based on the scrum

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,680
guide so what I've done in done is I

94
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,319
have gone and I have disabled epic and

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,959
feature I don't want those things I

96
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,879
don't want any hierarchy in my backlog a

97
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,599
product backlog is a flat list of things

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,760
to be done and epics and features and

99
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,160
user stories are

100
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,359
just states of a product backlog item

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,960
they're things that product backlog item

102
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:29,160
can be um so if you check on the backlog

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,880
levels I can't remove epic and features

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,400
on the back log levels I'll show you how

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,560
I've disabled them but I've disabled the

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,400
work items um so they can't be created

107
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,199
and on here at the same backlog level

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,120
here I've got backlog product backlog

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,960
item um and I also have bug which I've

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
put at that level as well I know that

111
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,919
that you'll see there somewhere else you

112
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,520
set that um I have tasks too if teams

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,039
want to use tasks uh but in general it's

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,199
whatever they want to do um each of

115
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,479
these backlog items so if I go back to

116
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,039
the work items and I open up the actual

117
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,479
work item um has a set of fields I've

118
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,680
add one custom field you'll see that in

119
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,840
a moment um and I've added um one custom

120
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,280
State and removed an inherit an existing

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,319
state uh so I don't want it to say

122
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,960
committed I don't think that reflects uh

123
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,880
new scrum guide I know it used to say

124
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,160
committed in it and it's a little thing

125
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,639
but in progress is is a much better

126
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
State and because I have bugs and put at

127
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,680
backlog items at the same level I've

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,160
also made exactly the same change uh for

129
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,960
bug as well so that they're they're

130
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,960
they're going to be the same at the same

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,360
level so that's the custom uh process

132
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,600
that I've created so I'm going to click

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,319
on my scrum demo and open up my um

134
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,319
project and what you will um most likely

135
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,120
be concerned about if you're whether

136
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,840
you're an engineer you you're going if

137
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,319
you're an engineer you're going to have

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,199
want to have access to all of these

139
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,960
other things as well um but for most um

140
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,400
people that are not engineers and

141
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,199
Engineers we're going to be talking

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,880
about boards so I'm just going to click

143
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,160
on that and open

144
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,599
boards so by default it's just going to

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,720
show me all the work items and you can

146
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,199
see when I click new work item I have

147
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,880
bug impediment product backlog item risk

148
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,759
uh task and test case those are just the

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:30,039
basic work items I've removed feature uh

150
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:32,039
uh and um epic okay and in asure Ops

151
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,319
there's a bunch of tools built on top of

152
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,280
the basic work item tracking system so

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
what we're going to take a look at is

154
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,120
how we can do some of the things that we

155
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,400
would normally expect to do as a scrum

156
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:50,120
team within the context of azure devops

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,759
so first off um there are some uh

158
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Logistics that we want to set up uh

159
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,280
before we get started so this is where

160
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,560
um you're this is something that maybe

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,199
your admin will do I prefer that every

162
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,639
everybody on the team has permission um

163
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,440
to do the things that I'm going to show

164
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,120
you but in the context of the project uh

165
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,919
there are two things that you definitely

166
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,479
want to configure one's area path and

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,280
one's iteration path um these are very

168
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,240
confusing brand new possibly

169
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,720
terminologies um but area path is the

170
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,360
breakdown of teams and what that looks

171
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,520
like and iteration path is a Time based

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,440
uh uh uh breakdown so I'm going to open

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,680
project

174
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,280
settings just going to pop open there in

175
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,599
the top right there we go so we're going

176
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,840
to the project settings and you can see

177
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:39,080
the name of the process remember scrum

178
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:41,680
2020 there as well um and on here on the

179
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,160
left hand side uh there's project

180
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,280
configuration so I'm going to go into

181
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,520
project configuration first um and you

182
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,000
can see that my uh current Sprint setup

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,360
which may or may not be a good idea uh

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,440
but what I have is um a season-based

185
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
model set up here so I have two halves

186
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,960
to the year I have the the first half

187
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,879
and the second half of the year and

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,520
inside of that half I've got um the 11

189
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,280
Sprints the 11 3we Sprints that make up

190
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,879
that half and then I've just started

191
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,720
adding a couple of Sprints in here and

192
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,440
you'll see that each of these Sprints

193
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:23,039
has a start and an end date um that's a

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,240
a subset of this uh higher level item so

195
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,960
I've said it up like that might be a bad

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,000
idea but that's what I've

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,760
done I then have three team well I

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,039
technically I have four teams um I have

199
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,080
a camman team which this is the area

200
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,719
path and this is the team that it's

201
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
assigned to I'll show you where that

202
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,920
happens in a second uh so I've got scrum

203
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,160
Team 1 and scrum Team 2 and cand team

204
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,800
one and then I've got scrum demo which

205
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,920
is the top level uh uh of uh this setup

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,680
so that's my areas and iterations that I

207
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,560
have set up I then go to my team

208
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
configuration just to validate the that

209
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,200
things are all in the right place and

210
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,360
this is where um you can see the epics

211
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
features and backlog items by default

212
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,079
when you create a team it's backlog

213
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,920
items and features I'm going to take

214
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,399
that features out and now that will not

215
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,480
be shown uh for this scrum team at all

216
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,360
um down the bottom here you can see uh

217
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,680
how am I going to work with bugs I

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,279
always pick bugs are managed with

219
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,480
requirements I have a blog post uh

220
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,720
called the the bug as a task

221
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
anti-pattern blog post uh that I'll put

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,560
in the comments that you should go take

223
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,480
a look at and make a decision right I've

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,560
decided that I want uh bugs managed with

225
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,279
requirements you can also choose bugs

226
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,399
are managed with tasks um and you can

227
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,800
also choose we're not going to manage

228
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,519
bugs on the back logger boards at all

229
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,320
we're going to keep them separate um

230
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,839
don't recommend that either bugs are

231
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
just backlog items that we need to work

232
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
with and deliver and and do stuff with

233
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,079
but in this context you can see at the

234
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,279
top here I've got the context of my team

235
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,880
um and what I've got is I've got

236
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,160
iterations that are assigned to this

237
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,720
team so this is

238
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,640
irrespective of um the the iterations

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,600
that we've created this is which ones

240
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,440
are assigned to this team uh so I've

241
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
gone ahead and I've assigned uh

242
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,200
iterations 1 to 10 to this team and you

243
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,279
can see the dates don't don't overlap

244
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,320
there um and then if I click on areas

245
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,320
you'll see I have one area assigned to

246
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,560
this team it's the default area and it's

247
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,680
for scrum Team 2 which matches the team

248
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,600
name so that's very straightforward and

249
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,160
very uh very simple in there if I were

250
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,839
to

251
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,880
switch to the kind of parents team that

252
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,880
is looking down uh across everything um

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,839
I have the main area path which is the

254
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,360
same as the project name uh here and

255
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,560
I've got sub areas are included so this

256
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,399
team will be able to see all of the sub

257
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,040
areas and in the iterations instead of

258
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,360
adding the individual Sprints cuz this

259
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,240
is like the higher level overview I'm

260
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,680
adding the seasons so if we're planning

261
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,120
the seasons uh we go to this level if

262
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,839
we're planning the Sprints uh we go to

263
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,680
the lower level um and I'll show you a

264
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,680
little bit how how that works maybe if

265
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,680
that works out so now you have an

266
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,120
understanding of hopefully of where to

267
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,800
go look to find the configurations where

268
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,959
to set up some of the things that will

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,279
manage the way your team looks each team

270
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,839
has its own area inside of this project

271
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,160
um and you can control what columns are

272
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,800
available on your backlog what columns

273
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,720
are available on your boards uh what how

274
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,839
how things are laid out um per team the

275
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
states on the work items are the same

276
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,279
across everybody so if we were doing

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,279
reporting across bunch of scrum teams we

278
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,320
would use the state-based

279
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,600
transition if we're doing reporting on

280
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,200
one scrum team uh we would just use the

281
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
column uh based transition

282
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,839
uh so I'm going to just go to the

283
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,279
backlog first for this uh team which

284
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,320
team I am scrum Team 2 perfect that's

285
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,040
the one I want to be looking at and the

286
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,680
first thing that we're probably going to

287
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,519
look at is is

288
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,680
refinement how do we do refinement in

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,000
Azure devops well refinement is all of

290
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,240
the work that we do against the product

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,320
backlog items as opposed to the ins

292
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,360
Sprint work which is against the product

293
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,000
itself right that results in the

294
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,240
increment we're all everybody on the

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,720
team the product owner the developers

296
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,839
perhaps other people um involved in this

297
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,440
story are going to be doing both of

298
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,720
those things all of the time uh some

299
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,519
people will spend more time in

300
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,760
refinement and less time in delivery uh

301
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,760
some teams we'll spend more time in

302
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,639
delivery and less time in refinement and

303
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,240
that's and perhaps it will change over

304
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,680
time that's just the way it is so during

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
refinement you're going to be um looking

306
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,399
at these back log items you're going to

307
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,320
be understanding what's coming up next

308
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,279
right how far into the future are you

309
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,199
looking um you might do some some

310
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,519
long-term planning you might do some

311
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:18,880
dependency management around these items

312
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:21,399
and your main friend here is the tagging

313
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,720
system this is your your main friend we

314
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:28,040
want to be able to manage this backlog

315
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,639
by filtering the items um filtering is

316
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,720
hugely important

317
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,639
because it allows us to group items that

318
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,639
might not be together in importance but

319
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,079
are together in another context another

320
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,880
type of slicing so for example um in

321
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,680
here um I have a bunch of tags uh

322
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,199
already added to these items uh so I

323
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,000
have a bunch of items that are um

324
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,279
associated with a particular product

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,399
that we're integrating in um so these

326
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,120
are these are integration points I have

327
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
uh uh some

328
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,680
different categorizations of work that

329
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,079
might be um have have have more

330
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,360
importance for certain groups of people

331
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,759
in here as well um so they can filter by

332
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,639
by their um slice um I have some work in

333
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,399
here that is to do with a particular

334
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,320
feature that we might be working on um

335
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,639
and I have some external stakeholders uh

336
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,000
to our team we've got some external

337
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,040
stakeholders to our team and some of

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,120
them are running projects that go across

339
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,639
the entire organization and a bunch of

340
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,079
different products our product might

341
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,399
have some work in it that we're doing to

342
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,959
support them um with our product and

343
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,320
they want to be able to see what's going

344
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,000
on ask us questions we want to

345
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,120
collaborate on those items so we want to

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,880
be able to filter on those items as well

347
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,800
so I'm going to show you how I can H do

348
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,279
some of those things in here uh right

349
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,399
now this is my backlog um this is an

350
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,880
ordered list no two have the same order

351
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,639
number and I can drag and drop these

352
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,079
around and put them in a different area

353
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,600
if I have a really big backlog don't

354
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,680
have one of those practice lean

355
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,040
inventory control but I can select a

356
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,800
bunch of items and I can move to a

357
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,360
particular position like in send to the

358
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,120
top or send it to um somewhere where

359
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,720
we're going to then do some fine grained

360
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,680
uh uh checking don't have that many

361
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,240
items that need to do that if you can't

362
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,600
actually grab it and drag it and scroll

363
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,759
you probably have too many items in your

364
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,399
back that's probably a good limus test

365
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,480
there uh so here I'm going to be um

366
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,639
filtering so over on the right hand side

367
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,399
here there's a filter button you can see

368
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,040
that highlighting I'm going to click on

369
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,240
filter and I'm going to do refinement

370
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,720
and we want to filter um by the thing

371
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,199
that we're looking at so uh the the

372
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,160
project manager who's running this cross

373
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,399
cutting uh a project who's been feeding

374
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,240
some items into our backlog is asking us

375
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,959
can we collaborate on some items can we

376
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,399
figure out if we can you know they need

377
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
to be different break them down do we

378
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,759
have the right thing we want to have a

379
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,639
conversation uh so we're going to get in

380
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,399
a room do a little bit of refinement and

381
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm going to click on tags and I'm going

382
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,319
to find Project a there it is and I'm

383
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,199
going to filter by those items and we're

384
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:18,600
going to have a conversation about them

385
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,399
um it will show the actual order

386
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,920
relative to right so this is number 11

387
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,199
on the total backlog number one and two

388
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,079
are not part of this project right um if

389
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,399
I turn the filter off po take filter off

390
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,040
and take like uh the where's project

391
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,120
there's five project a I'm going to put

392
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,160
it way down here and then I'm going to

393
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,519
filter by project a again there we go H

394
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,560
you'll see there's that 24 10 and 24 cuz

395
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,120
I just moved that item further down so

396
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,399
now we can have a conversation about

397
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,920
relative uh to the rest of the backlog

398
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,959
where are these things um I can't drag

399
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,920
and drop these things around anymore it

400
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,079
won't actually let me do that I'll drop

401
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,120
it and nothing will happen um but I can

402
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,519
have a conversation around these items

403
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,039
we can open them up we can edit them we

404
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:08,360
can break one down into smaller ones we

405
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,880
can delete that other one we can we can

406
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,439
do anything we want at

407
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,600
this uh we might do some forward

408
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,360
planning um we might assign them to

409
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,919
different Sprints so it's quite easy to

410
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,360
do that on the right hand side I have a

411
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,520
planning panel um if I click on more

412
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,640
actions view options I can turn on and

413
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,559
off uh planning down here planning um is

414
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:36,039
quite useful um so I might say that uh

415
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,919
these two are in Sprint 7 uh these ones

416
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,559
here I probably can't oh I can do that

417
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,679
there we go are going to be in Sprint 8

418
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,360
and these two are going to be in Sprint

419
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,919
n um and that's through the conversation

420
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,720
uh We've we're working with the whole

421
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,039
team we've taken a guess at what these

422
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,679
things are so this is not they're not

423
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,120
actually going to be in that Sprint the

424
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:59,559
team still has to have a conversation

425
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,120
during Sprint plan

426
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,960
uh but I might be looking out a little

427
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,159
bit into the future seeing what's going

428
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,159
on figuring out um figuring out what's

429
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,400
happening now my filtering is way more

430
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,559
powerful that than that um I'm going to

431
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,480
take off uh uh project a uh what I might

432
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,760
have is I might say well I want to see

433
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,400
feature a and here's uh Feature Feature

434
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,840
A here and I want to say and uh comply

435
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,039
check there it is there's only one item

436
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,840
in feature a for comply check but if I

437
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,720
take off itay you can see the rest of

438
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,799
the comply check uh uh items here so you

439
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,720
can create multiple slices you can do

440
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,760
ORS or ands in how you view these slices

441
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,159
in your backlog um so that you can

442
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,440
decide what it is you're doing what

443
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,679
you're opening up what you're editing um

444
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,000
and what you're doing in here and you

445
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,039
can tag people and have conversations

446
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,360
and track uh those things as you're as

447
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,720
you're going through this is a really

448
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,120
powerful tool for for storing the result

449
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,679
of your refinement you still have to do

450
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,840
the

451
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,360
refinement so the first event uh that

452
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,120
you're going to do as a as a scrum team

453
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,480
is Sprint planning um and when you're

454
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:16,240
planning your Sprint um just as in

455
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,280
refinement you're going to need to look

456
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,360
at the contents of your Sprint you're

457
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,400
going to need to have a conversation

458
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,520
about what your Sprint goal is going to

459
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,240
be you're perhaps going to store your

460
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,720
Sprint goal somewhere and then you're

461
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,039
going to have a conversation about what

462
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,440
what do we need to do to fulfill that

463
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:34,760
Sprint goal and then what other sorts of

464
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,480
work are we going to take into the into

465
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,520
the Sprint as your devops is going to

466
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,240
store the outcome of that conversation

467
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,919
but you still need to have that

468
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,320
conversation facilitate that

469
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:51,120
conversation as a team um we might

470
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:54,440
decide that in order to um facilitate

471
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,240
this next uh uh Sprint the most

472
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,840
important thing that we can be working

473
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,880
on is the group of work that results in

474
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,280
feature a um we think we've got enough

475
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,039
together to be able to to create some

476
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,880
something viable value that we can ship

477
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,200
in our product and we think it fits

478
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,799
quite snugly into our Sprint with lots

479
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,679
of other room for other things that

480
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,000
we're going to do um so I'm going to

481
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,559
filter to feature a and here are the

482
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,960
items um that we're going to do we can

483
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,640
see there's a couple of items that are

484
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,880
left over from the previous Sprint

485
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,039
Sprint six was the last Sprint our our

486
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,240
current Sprint that we going to be

487
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,200
working on is Sprint 7 um and what I

488
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,640
actually want to do is move all of these

489
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,159
items into Sprint 7 so I'm just going to

490
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,200
drag and drop and you can see that's

491
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:45,200
updated that uh iteration path so you

492
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,600
can see there's uh What uh 1 2 3 4 5 6

493
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,000
sixish items um but we have 11 items

494
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,039
total in the Sprint that's fine these

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,960
are the things that are going to be our

496
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,120
Sprint goal we're going to commit to our

497
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,360
Sprint goal if anything happens that's

498
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,000
unto we're going to focus on the Sprint

499
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,919
goal and other things drop away this is

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,360
our one most important thing that we're

501
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,000
going to do you might have multiple

502
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,320
things that you're going to do in a

503
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Sprint but pick one as this is the one

504
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,600
that we're going to prioritize over all

505
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,440
other things if we have to make choices

506
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,640
hopefully everything goes great and we

507
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,080
don't have to make choices uh but not

508
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,320
everything always goes great right um so

509
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,640
those have been moved into the Sprint I

510
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,240
can actually now click on sprints on the

511
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,120
left there and it should default to

512
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,559
Sprint 7 which is our current Sprint and

513
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,320
now I can see just the work that has

514
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,480
been assigned to the Sprint uh these

515
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,919
things should be approved I've not

516
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,799
actually done that yet so I'm just going

517
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:51,279
to edit that state and move them uh to

518
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,200
approved State

519
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:57,600
cuz approved there we go I've just moved

520
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,760
them all to approved that works cuz why

521
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,640
would you bring stuff that's not

522
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,799
approved into the Sprint right that's

523
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,559
data cleanliness uh problems creeping in

524
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:07,919
um and we you'll see that a few times as

525
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:12,840
we go through I'll always try and fix it

526
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,880
as I go um because the demo Gods right

527
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
um so we do have a couple of items that

528
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,360
were brought over from the previous

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Sprint this is totally fine if you have

530
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,120
a flow focus and you're modeling the

531
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,559
flow of work Sprint planning is the end

532
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,279
of the Sprint is not like a a hard

533
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,760
deadline you're going to have activities

534
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,279
you're going to have H changes that are

535
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
going to take multiple Sprints to be

536
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,240
able to deliver and if you're 3 days

537
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,480
before the end of a Sprint and there's

538
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,720
the next most important thing that's the

539
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,120
product owner there we have a

540
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,360
conversation the next most important

541
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,799
thing is a six- day task um sure we can

542
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,000
start it and that's totally fine and it

543
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,760
will just flow into the next Sprint that

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,440
is predicated on us having awesome

545
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,559
engineering practices where we can hide

546
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,600
that behind feature Flags so we can

547
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,960
still continuously shipped to production

548
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,559
we still have a usable working increment

549
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,120
at least for the Sprint review um while

550
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,679
still continuing to do work but maybe we

551
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,640
take that cut of the usable working

552
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,200
increment if that's how we're working we

553
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,799
take that cut uh prior to starting that

554
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,400
work and that's the version that we're

555
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,159
going to show at the Sprint review and

556
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,480
then we're going to start some more work

557
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,159
that is going to lead into the next

558
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,679
Point that's totally totally fine do it

559
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:30,320
as you as you see fit as long as you

560
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,000
have that us working increment that's of

561
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,799
value to somebody to show at the Sprint

562
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,960
review um all of that is is is okay it's

563
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:40,120
okay to do

564
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,000
that uh so here I have these items uh we

565
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,279
can reorder them inside of this at

566
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,559
Sprint backlog um that will affect the

567
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:51,600
product backlog so just be careful with

568
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,039
that and we can maybe create some kind

569
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,960
of plan to complete these items um if I

570
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:01,600
add I should be able to add tag tags on

571
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,360
here

572
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,400
tags

573
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,760
tags uh and oh joy that's uh there we

574
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,640
go I don't know why I did that joys of

575
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,720
JavaScript o

576
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,720
lovely uh so we'll be able to see what

577
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,000
features we've got I should be able to

578
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,039
filter these by tags so there's the

579
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
important stuff for feature a and then

580
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,760
there's all of the stuff that we're

581
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,200
going to be working on um during this

582
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,559
Sprint great we're going to create a

583
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,679
plan uh to complete those items that

584
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:39,080
could just be a whiteboard plan that we

585
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:43,399
agree as a team or if you do want you

586
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,640
can create subtasks for these items um

587
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,720
you can do that uh by clicking on the

588
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,760
taskboard here um and in the taskboard

589
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,480
you'll see the items pinned to the left

590
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,520
and you're able to add uh tasks to this

591
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,000
board you don't have to do tasks I

592
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,760
generally don't recommend using this

593
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,399
board apart from for planning purposes

594
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,679
um it's quite useful for that in general

595
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm going to be focusing on the flow of

596
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,000
value through the system um but during

597
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,600
Sprint planning um I might indeed uh use

598
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,600
some of these

599
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,600
ideas the second event that you're going

600
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
to hit and you're going to hit it loads

601
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,559
of times is your daily scrum uh when you

602
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,840
get into your daily scrum the probably

603
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,279
one of the better views

604
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,840
is the board view so you're going to be

605
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,840
looking at this board and seeing what's

606
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,000
happening with the flow of work trying

607
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,120
to identify if there are any issues in

608
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,880
your board and you can remember if I I

609
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,520
marked all those items as active and

610
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,840
I've hit the whip limit um because I'm

611
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,159
silly and I haven't Built My Board very

612
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,080
well at the moment but this is just a

613
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,120
the default board if you remember the

614
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,399
states on the work items new approved in

615
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,080
progress done if you're using um flow

616
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:06,840
metrics then the flow metrics that come

617
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,919
out of the box in Azure devops uh if I

618
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,440
do this uh the flow metrics start at a

619
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:17,559
particular time so H you've got cycle

620
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,840
time and lead time now we all know that

621
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:23,080
lead time is a special type of cycle

622
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,480
time and they're all cycle times if I do

623
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,600
into approved to leaving approved that's

624
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,440
a cycle time but those words have been

625
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,720
defined within the context of azure

626
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:38,000
devops for their reporting and if you

627
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:41,559
put on a cycle time um graph cycle time

628
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,320
graph is between uh these two oh that's

629
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:47,960
actually not in tall it's between these

630
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,720
two points okay so when it moves into

631
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,279
impr progress um the cycle time timer

632
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,840
will start when it moves out of impr

633
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,039
progress T cycle time start timer will

634
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,200
finish and this line over here is the

635
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,080
lead time so as soon as it crosses into

636
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,919
new your timer starting that's not

637
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:09,880
always ideal uh I do recommend using a

638
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,320
tool called actionable agile I'll cover

639
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,240
that in another video uh but it does

640
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,120
allow you a lot more flexibility in how

641
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,440
you want to report on this data and how

642
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,679
it gives you more insights into what's

643
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,159
going on but for this video I'm going to

644
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,200
show you the outof the Box uh

645
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,480
capabilities so one of the things that I

646
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,200
we would expect to do as a team is have

647
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,760
perhaps a more interesting board a

648
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,279
little bit more planning going on um a

649
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,320
little bit more decision rather than

650
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,600
just using the out of thebox States

651
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,720
these are the minimum States uh that

652
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,600
work goes through I highly recommend not

653
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,679
adding more states to the process but

654
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,919
instead just uh columns to the board if

655
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:57,640
you have a state that has to be true

656
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:01,039
across that every work item will go

657
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,240
through that State and you want it to be

658
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,200
applied to every team then add a

659
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,840
customization but don't do a

660
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,399
customization for like blocked that

661
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,720
should be a tag don't do a customization

662
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:18,159
for on hold or any intermittent states

663
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,919
that a piece of work might not enter the

664
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,159
states on your board should be a card

665
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,880
should flow from left to write through

666
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,679
all of the states ideally um so this

667
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
should be the common cause and then we

668
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,559
can deal with exceptions separately

669
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,480
preferably using tags I'll show you that

670
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,480
in a minute but what I want to do for my

671
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,000
for my daily I'm going to be looking at

672
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,200
the things uh that are in progress

673
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
you'll remember that I had some stuff

674
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,919
that's approved that we haven't started

675
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,960
yet if we've not augmented this board I

676
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,000
would probably move all of those items

677
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,799
to impr progress as soon as they hit the

678
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,080
Sprint but I don't want to do that that

679
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,960
seems to me a little bit um basic so

680
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,720
what I want to do instead is I want to

681
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,720
take this in progress column and I want

682
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,279
to split it into multiple columns so I'm

683
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,919
going to do that now so if you go over

684
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,120
to the the little Cog on the top right

685
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,039
this is for my for my

686
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,200
daily um you're going to see lots of

687
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,960
options now we can customize uh the

688
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,399
fields that are available on uh the work

689
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,519
item so we can add additional Fields uh

690
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,600
we can customize add some style rules

691
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,559
that can apply apply either to the color

692
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,000
of the card or titles we can apply style

693
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,960
rules based on field values on whatever

694
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,720
it is we want uh we can add tag colors

695
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,480
my favorite one is I've always oh uh I

696
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
don't have a block I haven't added

697
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,559
blocks to anything uh but I'm going to

698
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,279
add a blocked color make it like some

699
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,880
really bright red um that's going to be

700
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,799
my um that's going to highlight any

701
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,240
blocked items on my board give you a

702
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,000
visual indicator um you have some

703
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,919
annotations subtasks can be added on

704
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,240
here as well I've got that added I'll

705
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,399
show you how that works um for creating

706
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,600
creating the plan or changing the plan

707
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:12,880
um and what we're going to do is we're

708
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,960
going to add an additional column so I

709
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:19,240
want to take H impr progress and I kind

710
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,159
of want to uh split it I want to H what

711
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:28,320
am I going to do let's split it into

712
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:30,519
um options I guess so let's change this

713
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,080
to options because we want things to be

714
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:35,440
coming into our Sprint and then we're

715
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,880
going to pick from those options and

716
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,200
then we're going to replenish those

717
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,559
options uh during Sprint planning right

718
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,039
that's our that's our a general cycle we

719
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,679
can replenish any time but that's our

720
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:49,440
general cycle uh so this is going to be

721
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,440
in the in progress State there you can

722
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,640
see the mapping of the states on the

723
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,240
work item to the name of the column so

724
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,919
what I'm going to do is I'm going to add

725
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,360
a new column going to insert right and

726
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,799
this new column is also going to be for

727
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,320
in progress for both work items but what

728
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,600
are we going to call it

729
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,600
options um let's call

730
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,440
this develop I can't spell let's just

731
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,120
call it develop I definitely can't spell

732
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,840
so you'll see that as well throughout uh

733
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,679
develop and then we're going to put a

734
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:28,919
new one to the right called

735
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:31,919
validat y um and develop is going to be

736
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,559
split into doing and done columns but

737
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,840
validate isn't yeah that's what I'm

738
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,919
going to do so now uh obviously this

739
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,679
would not be done arbitrarily your team

740
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,360
would get together and have an agreement

741
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,559
on what this is uh but now I have my

742
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,080
options column so what I'm going to do

743
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:52,279
is I'm going to move um all of those

744
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,440
items that I wanted in this Sprint into

745
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:57,399
the options column um yeah that's what

746
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm going to do for this one I actually

747
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,200
have a idea for how I would set this up

748
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,600
but again that should come out in the

749
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,919
wash so I'm going to move all of these

750
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,559
uh state to in

751
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,120
progress so this is me starting all the

752
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,840
work at the beginning of the Sprint not

753
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:19,399
always the best one for flow um but you

754
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,760
can plan around that so see everything's

755
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,519
jumped over uh into options so now we

756
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,559
can say um I'm going to pull this into

757
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,279
doing for develop and we're going to

758
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,960
have few items in there I'm going to

759
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:36,039
push a few items in here just so the

760
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,120
board looks a bit nicer just for fun um

761
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:40,000
and then as things move across the board

762
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,279
I've got my options which is my Sprint

763
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,480
backlog um I'm going to pull things into

764
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,399
develop um and I'm going

765
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,279
to do something in there okay and then

766
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,360
things are going to move into develop

767
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,360
done I we've done the work and we we

768
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,080
think it's finished and then at some

769
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,760
point we're going to pull things from

770
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,519
done into validate and somebody's going

771
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,039
to do some validation could be any

772
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:07,399
member of the team is going to uh maybe

773
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,320
the basic Val validation that we do is

774
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:11,880
we check against the definition of done

775
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,080
right let's double check let's double

776
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,080
make sure um that things meet the

777
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,279
definition of done if it does meet the

778
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,399
definition of done we then push it into

779
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,200
done and I don't know if you saw that

780
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,360
but as soon as I pushed it into done the

781
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,799
states changed to done so the columns

782
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,799
here if I I'm just going to take an item

783
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,760
I'm going to highlight it uh let's

784
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,760
highlight it as

785
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:40,480
blocked cuz I just want you to be able

786
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,639
to see it there we go so I have this red

787
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,960
this is the red card right um it's in

788
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:48,120
approved in this column and when I move

789
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,120
it into options it moves to impr

790
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,679
progress right as soon as I move it into

791
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,360
develop the in progress doesn't change

792
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,799
cuz these three columns are all an in

793
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:02,399
progress uh

794
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,679
validate oh see this is how why you test

795
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,679
stuff I put that let's move that back

796
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,760
fix that validate column I did that

797
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:16,240
wrong P approved in oh in progress yes I

798
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,520
know save that there we go now I can

799
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,520
take that column and put it in validate

800
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,280
and it ends up in progress there we go

801
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,119
perfect oh um and it's still in progress

802
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,079
and as soon as that moves over here it's

803
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,800
then marked as done okay so now I can

804
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,000
look at this board during uh my daily I

805
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,720
can see what's going on I can see the

806
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,760
work uh flowing across the

807
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,720
board the next event Instagram is the

808
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,000
Sprint

809
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,639
review uh there are some data points

810
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,960
that you might might want to look at in

811
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,879
the Sprint review most of those I would

812
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,599
get actually from actionable agile again

813
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,639
um but there are probably some things

814
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,320
that I'm going to look at I might jump

815
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,359
over to my uh Sprint and I'm going to

816
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,839
say what of these items is done and I'm

817
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,560
going to I'm going to cheat I'm going to

818
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,079
change the tag to that uh not project a

819
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,680
feature a and we're going to mark all of

820
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,680
those things as uh

821
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,680
State

822
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,880
done there we go and then I'm going to

823
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,970
so during this Sprint we managed to get

824
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,200
all of the things uh for our

825
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,560
[Music]

826
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,720
um spring goal completed so they're all

827
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,280
marked as done we're all good to go

828
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,480
that's what we're going to show the

829
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,040
stakeholders and separately we're going

830
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,160
to do uh perhaps we're going to do a

831
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,240
demo um we're going

832
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:46,160
to show what was created against what

833
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,440
we've got in here but then the next part

834
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,760
of our Sprint uh review which is

835
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,880
arguably the most important part is we

836
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,640
need to figure out whether our product

837
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,000
back clog still

838
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,800
reflects transparency of the future

839
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
still reflects the work we have to do

840
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,200
next so we're going to have

841
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,640
conversations with the stakeholders uh

842
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,079
that come to our uh Sprint review um

843
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,400
with the team we're going to collaborate

844
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,440
on what's happening in the business

845
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,839
what's happening in the market uh what's

846
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,720
happened in the product what are the

847
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,560
choices that we've made we're going to

848
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,640
put that all together in a big Melting

849
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,119
Pot and we're going to go update uh the

850
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,560
product backlog which it looks like I

851
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,800
have uh oh cuz it's got a filter on

852
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,800
there that's why there we go we're going

853
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,599
to go update the product backlog so the

854
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,599
product backlog is not going to include

855
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,040
any of the items that are already done

856
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,760
it's going to include the items that are

857
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,720
still to do and since these are in

858
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,440
progress I might like to actually just

859
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,839
stick them up the top there we go and

860
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,280
now we're probably definitely going to

861
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:49,359
do these things they've already been

862
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:52,160
started I'll perhaps show you how to not

863
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,079
have to have them started and then um

864
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,839
I've got some uh work here that is

865
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,160
coming up next this has been approved we

866
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,480
need to go refine these items um we need

867
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,920
to have this conversation during Sprint

868
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,800
um review where we talk about um what

869
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,880
needs to change here and I want would

870
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:15,680
like to see um physical changes in the

871
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,480
product backlog during that event

872
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,200
because the next thing we do after a

873
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,720
Sprint review is we're going to go into

874
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,400
the Retro and then we're going to go

875
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,040
into next Sprint planning and who's

876
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,480
going to update the product back Club

877
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,839
between those items probably no nobody

878
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,079
so this is the last moment we have to

879
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:35,200
get those changes in uh so I'd be

880
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,520
opening these items I'd be making

881
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,119
changes we'd be talking to the

882
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,040
stakeholders about it does this still

883
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:42,119
reflect what it is we need to do is

884
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,960
there changes that we've learned maybe

885
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,440
the stakeholders gone and talked to

886
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,640
additional people in the organization

887
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,480
and they want to bring in some changes

888
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,880
those these are all maybe there's a

889
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,280
whole body of new work that needs to go

890
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:58,560
in here we can start creating it uh uh

891
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,480
uh now um so that we have the best

892
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,040
possible product backlog for going into

893
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,880
the next Sprint planning and if there's

894
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,480
a bunch of stuff we really don't

895
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,319
understand perhaps they need to be able

896
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,040
to go on a list of we're going to need

897
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:13,920
to get together with these stakeholders

898
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:16,079
and discuss and refine uh uh more things

899
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,240
into the P backlog during the next

900
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,280
Sprint um because that's work that

901
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,319
happens all the time refinement happens

902
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,839
all the time but what's the important

903
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:27,640
stuff we need to update here to get get

904
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,880
straight into the next Sprint um feed

905
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,880
back or core changes anything like that

906
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,240
should be in

907
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,800
there the last event in scrum is our

908
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,160
Sprint retrospective I'm probably not

909
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,359
going to spend as much time in aure

910
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,079
devops during my retrospective we might

911
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,319
have a conversation about things that

912
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,200
happened during the Sprint things that

913
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:50,000
were left over things that were

914
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,680
difficult we might need to go look at

915
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,839
some items in the product backlog and

916
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,000
discuss why were they so difficult what

917
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,520
did we not understand and we might do

918
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,280
some root cause we might do some

919
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,440
analysis on that uh but in general we're

920
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,000
probably going to be having uh separate

921
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,920
conversations people processes tools

922
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,880
relationships all of those things are on

923
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,520
the table for the Sprint retrospective

924
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,560
and that doesn't have a lot to do uh

925
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,640
with the contents of aure

926
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,839
devops so I wanted to show you a board

927
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,800
uh that was done a little bit

928
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,960
differently so here I have a board um

929
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,160
where I have the the backlog um on the

930
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,079
left hand side so I have a column for

931
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,800
backlog so that's the new state and then

932
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:32,880
if you remember we had the approved

933
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,680
State and I've renamed the approved

934
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,079
state state to Discovery and set it as

935
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,400
doing and done so I have that doing and

936
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,839
done uh uh in here I've colorcoded these

937
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,040
items cuz they're too big so I've got a

938
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,520
field called uh item size and it has

939
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,920
unsized right size and oversized with

940
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,319
unsized being the default so if it's uh

941
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,480
oversized then it's going to highlight

942
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:59,800
that we need to do some some refinement

943
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,960
work and that's where in this discovery

944
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,720
column doing um I wouldn't expect to see

945
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,640
anything with this orange title any

946
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,400
further this needs to be broken down um

947
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,839
refined a little bit more this might

948
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,880
split into multiple items um before we

949
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,560
uh start bring it into that that

950
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,319
Discovery Discovery done column this is

951
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,040
where we might do some uh usability

952
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,960
analysis we might do some user studies

953
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,880
we might do paper prototyping we might

954
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,240
do

955
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,520
um all of those things in this column if

956
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,720
you're doing a lot of those things you

957
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,760
might split it out into multiple columns

958
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:41,200
for um how you're going to process that

959
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,079
work um and then it moves into analysis

960
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,400
at the beginning of the Sprint so if you

961
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:50,560
remember our uh timer starting for oh

962
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,640
that's not the right one that one our

963
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,800
timer uh for cycle time is between these

964
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:00,839
two lines within this box um so cycle

965
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,960
time uh starts here at analysis whereas

966
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:09,480
uh lead time uh starts all the way over

967
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:12,680
here and that's for the buil-in uh um

968
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,880
stats hopefully this gave you some ideas

969
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,520
about how you can use as your devops to

970
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,960
support uh your scrum environment if

971
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,520
you're more interested in uh uh the

972
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,560
board and the columns I have a cand

973
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,280
session which goes a lot more in depth

974
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,400
into that story as well if you do have

975
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,520
any questions put them in the comments

976
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,520
below and get in touch if you need any
