Nowhere does it directly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it discuss its calculation, application, or improvement within Scrum, Kanban, or Agile frameworks. While it addresses continuous improvement and flow-based practices in passing, these are discussed generally without any reference to SLE, its time-probability framing, or its impact on predictability or flow. The content is targeted at Scrum practitioners and technologists, somewhat aligning with the audience for SLE, but with no SLE-specific alignment, the signal is weak on this axis. No penalties were applied as the content is current and does not contradict or undermine the category. Overall, the confidence score is quite low due to the lack of direct or even tangential discussion of Service Level Expectation.",
