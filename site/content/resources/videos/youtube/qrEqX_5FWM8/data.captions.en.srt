1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,059
so the question is an overview of uh

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,240
immersive learning experience

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,520
and I I I think we need to start with

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,740
what the heck is immersive learning

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,740
right because that's just a word that

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,420
somebody's using uh but in in the way

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,519
I'm describing it and and the way

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,820
scrum.org describes it right immersive

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,980
learning is uh taking the traditional

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,200
the traditional model right is that you

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,180
do a two-filled a class or it's four

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,219
half days consecutively that's the kind

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,020
of traditional model

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,899
um in the immersive learning approach

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,000
what we're trying to do is

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,520
connect more

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,760
the things that we're talking about in

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,860
the class to the participants real world

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,020
right so we want to connect them with

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,520
the story uh that they're they're

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,960
telling in their business rather than

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,940
our made-up story because in most of the

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,100
classes especially public ones right we

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,260
have to use case studies so that

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,880
everybody's talking about the same topic

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,320
so that we can create those

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,560
relationships but in an immersive class

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,360
um which we can we can we can connect it

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
to their real world and we have more

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,900
time to talk about and connect it to

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,280
each individual person's real world

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,479
right even if they're from multiple

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,920
companies

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,320
so what we're going to do in the

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,380
immersive class is instead of doing

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,259
consecutive days or you know short four

37
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,439
half days uh we're going to break it up

38
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,520
into more sessions because we're going

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,259
to make

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,200
um each of the four half day sessions

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,479
has more stuff in it now

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
uh so instead of just doing the content

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,659
and then they go home or doing the

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,700
content and hear some homework to read

45
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,960
right it's

46
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,939
um

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,040
the first part of the session is we're

48
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,259
going to debrief the previous

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,220
assignment right so obviously in the

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,360
first session we're not going to have

51
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,100
one but we're going to debrief the

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
previous assignment that's that's

53
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,640
probably an hour to an hour and a half

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
right that's that's that's going to be

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,659
quite a lot of time if you've got six

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,459
people in the class we want to hear from

57
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,739
everybody talk about the problems we're

58
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,360
going to discuss it how how it went

59
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,560
and then we're going to have some some

60
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,940
some learning we're going to learn

61
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,580
something as well right we're going to

62
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,540
talk about some new stuff in that and

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,280
then we're going to give out an

64
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,640
assignment for the next week and that

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,680
assignment is something that you can do

66
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,940
in your real company something you can

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,800
go back and practice right for for for

68
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,840
for the next week right what's the

69
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,940
difference between uh musicians and

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,739
martial arts other what's the similarity

71
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,020
between musicians and martial artists

72
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,760
they practice right

73
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,080
um so we need time to practice and this

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,180
is part of that story and you can

75
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,800
practice within your organization by

76
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,480
bringing in your real stuff so it might

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,879
be I don't know I'm trying to think of

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
what an assignment might be

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,780
um an assignment might be

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,519
um uh figuring out in your organization

81
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,140
and being very high level here but

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
figuring out in your organization what

83
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,239
does value mean to your business

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,680
if you're the product owner class what

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,660
does value mean to your business your

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,120
business might not even notice now

87
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,440
right so

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,239
as part of that assignment we would give

89
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
you some help some pointers maybe some

90
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,560
workshops you can run in your

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,000
organization to try and figure out what

92
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,500
that information is and what it means

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,480
and the answer might be your business

94
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,700
doesn't know right that might be what

95
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
you come back with the next week so then

96
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,420
we can have a discussion about what else

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,819
can you do to figure it out and that's

98
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,220
how we're connecting that story back so

99
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,200
this means because we've got this a

100
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,819
debrief part that we've got the

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
four-hour session that we were just

102
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,159
doing

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,739
you know the content for the course

104
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,220
means we've got less time probably only

105
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,080
half the time to do new content uh so

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,720
it's spread out over a longer period of

107
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,440
time so instead of four half days uh I

108
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,360
think the PSM is seven half days uh done

109
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,840
one a week

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,000
um so that gives you a week's worth of

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,340
time should be five business days or

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,560
four four business days right uh to be

113
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,480
able to practice that or try the thing

114
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,400
that you're going to going to going to

115
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,319
do and but each of them is different

116
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,280
each of the classes is different so the

117
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,780
EPS I think is 10 weeks I think the the

118
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,240
pspo is eight weeks it depends on how

119
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,500
how the the the the the exercises break

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,400
down uh within it but it is that

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,520
um

122
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,860
different format right and it's

123
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,560
different from the traditional format

124
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,500
because it makes those connections that

125
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,100
is the the the the the point there and

126
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,100
the reason I really like this format is

127
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,280
because I feel like it will give more

128
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,440
value to the students right lots of

129
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,320
people come into classes and they leave

130
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,759
especially the two full day classes they

131
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
leave with the brains full of knowledge

132
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,720
and they're gonna remember Ten Percent

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,860
two weeks from now

134
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,199
um they're not really going to connect

135
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,360
it back to the way they work how they

136
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,400
how they're going to apply it to even

137
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,340
understand how to apply it within their

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,919
organization within their perhaps

139
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,440
corporate context right with all of the

140
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,740
corporate rules that they have how do

141
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,080
they then get questions answered

142
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,440
um so

143
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,900
this format really allows us to directly

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,120
connect what we're talking about back to

145
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,699
real things in every participants

146
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,620
company

147
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,660
that's why I I think this format is

148
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,639
great
