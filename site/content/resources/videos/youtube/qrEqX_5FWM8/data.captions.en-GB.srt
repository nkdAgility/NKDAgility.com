1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,920
So the question is an overview

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,300
of immersive learning experience.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,630
And I think we need to start
with what the heck is immersive learning,

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,540
right? Because
that's just a word

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,990
that somebody's using.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,000
But in the way I'm describing it
and the way scrum.org describes it, right?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,160
Immersive learning
is taking the traditional model,

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,480
right? Is that
you do a two full day class

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,430
or it's four half days consecutively.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,260
That's the kind of traditional model.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,260
In the immersive learning
approach, what we're trying

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,400
to do is connect more the things
that we're talking about in the class

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,420
to the participants'
real world, right?

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,960
So we want to connect them with the story

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,420
that they're telling in
their business rather than

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,420
our made up story.
Because in most of the classes,

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,840
especially public ones,
we have to use case studies so

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,940
that everybody's talking
about the same topic so

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,400
that we can create those relationships.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,020
But in an immersive class

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,600
which we can connect it to
their real world

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,520
and we have more time to talk
about and connect it to each

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,100
individual person's real world, right?
Even if they're from multiple companies.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,860
So what we're gonna do
in the immersive class is instead

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,350
of doing consecutive days
or short four half days,

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,490
we're going to break it up
into more sessions,

27
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,680
because we're gonna make each
of the four half

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,940
day sessions has more stuff in it now.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,440
So instead of just doing the content
and then they go home or doing the content

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,340
and here's some homework to read,

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,080
it's the first part
of the session is we're going

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,680
to debrief the previous assignment, right?
So obviously in the first session we're

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,460
not going to have one, but we're going
to debrief the previous assignment.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,960
That's probably an hour to an hour
and a half right that's that's

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,480
that's going to be quite a lot
of time if you've got six people

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,420
in the class we want to hear
from everybody talk

37
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,630
about the problems we're going
to discuss it how it went

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,360
and then we're going to have some
some some learning we're going

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,040
to learn something
as well right we're going to talk

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,800
about some new stuff in
that and then we're going

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,820
to give out an assignment
for the next week.

42
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,020
And that assignment is something
that you can do in your real company,

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,760
something you can go back
and practice, right,

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,640
for the next week, right?
What's the difference between musicians

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,770
and martial art?

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,860
What's the similarity
between musicians and martial artists?

47
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,550
They practice, right?

48
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,540
So we need time to practice,
and this is part of that story,

49
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,560
and you can practice within
your organization by bringing in

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,720
your real stuff.
So it might be, I don't know,

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,140
I'm trying to think
of what an assignment might be.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,920
An assignment might be

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,760
figuring out in your organization.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,140
I'm being very high level here,
but figuring out in

55
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,640
your organization what does
value mean to your business.

56
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,827
If you're a product owner, class,
what does value mean to your business?

57
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,400
If you're a product owner, class,
what does value mean to your business?

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,360
Your business might
not even know just now.

59
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,020
So as part of that assignment,
we would give you some help,

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,640
some pointers, maybe some
workshops you can run in

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,320
your organisation to try
and figure out what that information is

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,080
and what it means.
And the answer might be

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
your business doesn't know,
right? That might be what you come back

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,800
with the next week. So then we
can have a discussion about,

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,990
well, what else
can you do to figure it out?

66
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,430
And that's how we're connecting
that story back.

67
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,260
So this means, because
we've got this debrief part,

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,540
that we've got the four hour session
that we were just doing,

69
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,060
you know, the content for the
course, means we've got less time,

70
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,490
probably only half
the time to do new content.

71
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,340
So it's spread out
over a longer period of time.

72
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,900
So instead of four half days,
I think the PSM is seven half days,

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,300
done one a week.

74
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,860
So that gives you a week's worth
of time, should be five business days

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,680
or four business days, right?

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,110
To be able to practice that
or try the thing that you're going to do.

77
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,020
But each of them's different.
Each of the classes is different.

78
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,130
So the APS,

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,280
I think is 10 weeks.

80
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,180
I think the PSPO is eight weeks.

81
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,040
It depends on how the exercises
break down within it, but it is

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
that different format, right?

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,840
And it's different
from the traditional format

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,790
because it makes those connections.

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,050
That is the point there.

86
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,460
And the reason I really
like this format is because I feel

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,540
like it will give more value
to the students.

88
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,490
Lots of people come
into classes and they leave,

89
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,610
especially the two full day classes,

90
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,340
they leave with their brains full
of knowledge and they're going

91
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,130
to remember 10% two weeks from now.

92
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,920
They're not really going
to connect it back to the way they work.

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
How are they going to apply it?
Do they even understand how to apply it

94
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,800
within their organisation?

95
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,450
Within their, perhaps,

96
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,680
corporate context, right?
With all of the corporate rules

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,740
that they have.

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,420
How do they then get questions answered.

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,920
So this format really allows
us to directly connect what we're talking

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,160
about back to real things
in every participant's company.

101
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,040
That's why I think this format is great.
