I'm Russell Miller I'm a professional

5
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,890
scrum grinder with scrum org I live in

6
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,890
Atlanta Georgia USA

7
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,550
have a couple of under under my belt

8
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:34,280
I've talked the professional scrum

9
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,770
master course the professional scrum

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,460
product don't of course live virtual and

11
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:43,430
this was my first opportunity to deliver

12
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:46,040
the professional agile leadership

13
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,690
essentials course via a live virtual

14
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,690
training method of delivery

15
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,720
very powerful course it was very

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,750
successful in my limited experience but

17
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,000
although that depends upon them the Venn

18
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,270
diagram of you know trainer and

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,930
circumstances and in class and so we had

20
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,930
a good experience

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,810
I've taught it several times maybe not

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,090
eight times yet it's one of my favorite

23
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,380
courses that the scrum dot org offers

24
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,380
the world

25
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:44,840
it's good after an event we do it during

26
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,790
training but also good after an event to

27
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,580
look back at the things that went well

28
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,090
to try to amplify that for future class

29
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,570
experiences and for things that didn't

30
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:10,650
go as well to make to inspect those and

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:13,170
make an adaptation you sound great

32
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:19,950
well I would have heard me anyway cuz

33
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:23,160
but you I was coming through it so yes I

34
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,530
was saying that in the professional I do

35
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,770
leadership classes really it's targeted

36
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:35,480
at those folks who are in a position on

37
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:43,140
edge scrum teams but that aren't maybe

38
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:47,000
directly on the scrum team and we taught

39
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:54,720
it with a combination of Microsoft team

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,500
as the communication channel is called

41
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,950
mural as are all that it's like

42
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,260
wakeboarding it is what boring tool

43
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,630
that's right we have a virtual canvas

44
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,930
that class participants and instructors

45
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:14,190
can apply images to in text and tables

46
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,380
and video a lot of rich rich

47
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,550
communication may be richer than simply

48
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,540
audio that's for sure

49
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,090
yeah and I I like the tool it had some

50
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,440
the pros I think you've mentioned this

51
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:31,980
that it it's like being it's as like

52
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:36,110
being in a classroom like he's on a wall

53
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:39,510
and drawing things I think you could get

54
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:44,760
but the downside for me is it was a

55
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:48,010
little bit laggy I wasn't performing so

56
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:52,480
well but I think time

57
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:56,140
I had zero no not like tiny but zero

58
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:02,580
problem was like why I think that might

59
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:07,480
be my setup I need it or changed the way

60
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:13,210
organizing it I've God I'm using a my

61
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:15,690
purpose a main machine think I've just

62
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,690
got it in

63
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,720
great machine I love that and have one

64
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:27,580
myself yeah I do like it as well

65
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,580
although I never detached the monitor

66
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,610
but I find it to be pretty pretty useful

67
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:44,080
and generally its performance but I've

68
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:45,470
just been having issues I'm running and

69
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,919
running

70
00:06:45,470 --> 00:07:03,099
oh yes video open broadcast system

71
00:06:48,919 --> 00:07:03,099
studio and I'm feeding my binging sheep

72
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:11,719
so I've got my OBS feeding into

73
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:17,949
Microsoft team so that I can show slides

74
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:20,949
or my desktop or something behind I

75
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,949
can't

76
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:31,819
which has been useful gives me some good

77
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:39,620
capabilities but it does take extra

78
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:41,630
resources on them yes this this new way

79
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,440
of working I think many of us are

80
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,199
discovering that the tools whether that

81
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,419
be webcams or whether that be laptops

82
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,370
would that be monitors or where that be

83
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:59,050
headsets that we were suitable for the

84
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:02,150
occasional or even multi day per week

85
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:06,099
telecommuting don't suit us quite as

86
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,099
well for 100% remote work

87
00:08:52,819 --> 00:09:00,410
it was an opportunity to to reunite the

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,420
world doesn't know that years ago even

89
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,930
before I was actually several years

90
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,209
before I was a PST that I actually

91
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,300
enlisted your help with a team that I

92
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,370
was on and you came and gave both me and

93
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,470
some others in my organization some

94
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,829
training and made a positive difference

95
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,569
and so it was it wasn't me paying you

96
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,329
back this was me an opportunity to get

97
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:25,459
to participate in a training from the

98
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:28,689
other side of the table with you so it

99
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:32,829
was a both a great experience but also a

100
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:32,829
bit of a treat for me Martin

101
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:01,270
I think Windows 8 had been on the market

102
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,270
for about 15 minutes when you came to

103
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,850
oh that makes it true actually

104
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:46,279
well you haven't you haven't heard but

105
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:52,499
that that class and the the outcomes

106
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:54,809
that our team were able to help bring

107
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:57,829
bring to bear or bring bring to lie to

108
00:11:54,809 --> 00:12:00,480
bring happen we're actually very

109
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:03,529
significant and I think that your help

110
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,529
was not was instrumental

111
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,529
kentley

112
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,120
it was good because each of the teams

113
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:48,430
could get some individual attention

114
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,350
which is not always possible even with

115
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,470
alive so this is a bit of an advantage

116
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:57,520
because in a live class unless the class

117
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:58,150
is very very large I'm teaching those by

118
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,530
myself

119
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:05,650
and so having having a second person is

120
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:09,250
an advantage for those participants I

121
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:12,190
believe that that's it's actually more

122
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,660
more often available maybe more often is

123
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,970
probably a threat word but it's it's

124
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,950
Mazie it's more possible because I

125
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,210
certainly wouldn't have probably

126
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,510
traveled to Scotland this week to be

127
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,510
with you

128
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,899
the the virtual training while there are

129
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:46,499
some challenges that we're going to

130
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:50,879
articulate here in just a moment there

131
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:53,670
are some some significant advantages and

132
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,240
one of which is that you can participate

133
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,529
as a student in a training that you

134
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,680
might not have been able to participate

135
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:07,129
in not that it would be too far to

136
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,269
travel but the travel time to join is is

137
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:13,439
infinitesimal it's right the distance

138
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:16,470
between your you were I guess your sofa

139
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:19,220
and wherever you want to participate in

140
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:21,779
the classroom thanks for covering there

141
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:38,819
hopefully my white Mike was working

142
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:44,879
other people otherwise we want to turn

143
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:46,920
up so I can see and it breaks and so one

144
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,149
that one of the things that I think I

145
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,939
think it would have been difficult to

146
00:15:48,149 --> 00:16:00,180
facilitate the class without a little

147
00:15:53,939 --> 00:16:02,189
bit I think I my my I guess my I find it

148
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,779
really easy to switch between the rooms

149
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:13,259
that was something that it's very easy

150
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:19,740
easier once the meeting is started in a

151
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:22,139
room you can I can get there very quick

152
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:28,110
in the thing that maybe concerns me

153
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:30,480
about running class um without help or

154
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:34,079
even running a class with more than two

155
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:39,660
teams even if those trainers it's how do

156
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:42,649
you know when another team no yes and I

157
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,269
can think of all sorts of ways to

158
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:49,319
facilitate that for the students like

159
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:50,700
they can just yeah most directly even so

160
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:56,580
they can send us is right I said

161
00:16:50,700 --> 00:17:02,190
or they can put a message on in channel

162
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:09,560
we were using what is just difficult to

163
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:12,000
know each people yes

164
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,000
something I've thought of doing which

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,450
might be beneficial is for this class I

166
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,910
did our technology check with folks why

167
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,580
got the the students to set up a meeting

168
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,930
with a 30-minute meeting with me I think

169
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,240
I said actually said it at fifteen

170
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:40,410
minutes just to get together check the

171
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:42,210
tail works and we have the student but

172
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,760
one of the students it was 45 minutes

173
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,340
making sure that they all do work

174
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,770
getting things set up we how we would

175
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,580
run in the class to they were

176
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:57,840
comfortable and I think I was thinking

177
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,950
over the next week I'll probably make

178
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,710
some functional videos but I can ask

179
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:08,460
students to watch first rather than

180
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,690
having so many one-on-one fashions do

181
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:15,630
those thing that's it that's actually a

182
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:19,550
great idea because I have been reluctant

183
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:22,560
to take my students time in advance

184
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,660
because I'm trying to realize that

185
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,380
people have other things to do so I

186
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,810
asking to attend a 16 hour class plus an

187
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,880
extra hour before I've been reluctant to

188
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,280
do that and I actually had it had not

189
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,510
occurred to me to make a pre-recorded

190
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,610
video so that's a brilliant idea

191
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:50,880
yeah just here's how I'm going to run

192
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:52,620
the class but anyway for the majority of

193
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,340
the students I think the majority of the

194
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:01,290
students had used teams before yes

195
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,809
therefore they didn't need any help and

196
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:07,019
in fact the number of this

197
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:09,119
but into the team um the week before

198
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,159
when I said to top and ID'd everybody

199
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:15,779
they were in how to loot road and send

200
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:22,289
me a message or I'd even got wet them

201
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:28,889
that was Jim oh but I know that there

202
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:31,019
can be authentic Asian issues with email

203
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:35,909
address that's been enabled yourself the

204
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:39,299
kind if if they're using their corporate

205
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:45,259
identity their ability to do that is

206
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:51,119
with it their enterprise if their own up

207
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:52,619
there logging in with a little bit

208
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:58,679
difficult I do have one customer that

209
00:19:52,619 --> 00:20:06,240
can't do that they're they're not much

210
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:10,230
the other it's all of reality and but I

211
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,590
always add all my students about teams

212
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,379
channel or my students can operate of

213
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,119
the course we're posting then they take

214
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:22,559
a class with me I have a script that

215
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,950
adds them permission where for the

216
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,950
classes

217
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:35,149
that's a it's a powerful advantage if I

218
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:39,829
may say Martin to the trainings that you

219
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:43,519
offer is the ability not only to have

220
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:47,509
the in-person well live training and

221
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,999
advice but also to connect even after

222
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:52,099
the fact through teams and gain

223
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:55,899
additional value after the courses of

224
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:59,329
them yeah even the folders that have the

225
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:01,519
training material like the really it

226
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:06,249
soft PDF of us like that afterwards I

227
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:09,679
actually keep that updated as the

228
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:13,669
courseware come out from the dark in

229
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:19,929
team that and give you students they

230
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:19,929
will get access to you access

231
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:29,340
I can

232
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,340
look at things again that works Oh

233
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:43,220
technologies that we watch I think not

234
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,220
much it's worth noting however that

235
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,740
students were using their laptop

236
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:53,480
integrated cameras or their separate

237
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:55,789
webcams and even that presents it's an

238
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,700
advantage we can see you see each other

239
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:02,890
the disadvantage is that it can be

240
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:08,029
distracting if a student or instructor

241
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:09,890
changes camera angle then it's in person

242
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,690
if you put your head down or look to the

243
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,120
side it's sort of a natural thing it's

244
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,620
not distracting but if someone switches

245
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,270
their camera off or switches to a

246
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,220
different camera or to the integrated

247
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:29,630
camera on their laptop it can be Sully

248
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:39,020
distracting candidly yeah well I'm and

249
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:41,570
it looks like I'm not paying yeah I do

250
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,480
think that culturally this is an opinion

251
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:47,299
culturally we're going to get over that

252
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,770
sooner rather than later and an example

253
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:55,159
that reminds me of the smart watches

254
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:57,260
right once upon a time if I did this you

255
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,860
would think I was ready to stop talking

256
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:04,070
with you but because we get messages on

257
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,659
our wrists now it's it's no longer oh

258
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,380
you don't want to hear what I say it's

259
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:10,940
oh you've got a text from your wife or

260
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,909
you've got a reminder that you have a

261
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,500
meeting in an hour and so uh eventually

262
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,059
you're going to realize that just

263
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,980
because I'm not looking directly at the

264
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,590
camera and doesn't mean I'm not with you

265
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,970
yeah that's right yeah because we have

266
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,380
we have we make the assumption that

267
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,049
you're doing email or you're doing

268
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,350
something else entirely

269
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:35,480
right they don't cite it sometimes as an

270
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:38,720
instructor right whatever is coming up

271
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:42,559
next well that can be difficult when

272
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,110
you're also Europe who time engaged with

273
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,149
students

274
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:52,659
but then you know you need to set

275
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:56,730
something up or the next thing yes I'm

276
00:23:52,659 --> 00:24:00,970
doing my next by virtual classes

277
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,620
whoo-hoo yes Apps Foundation's

278
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:06,010
professional scrum foundations classes

279
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:10,990
so that's kind of like and I describe it

280
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:14,080
as it's the one or one from class where

281
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:18,789
we just focus on the scrum guide we

282
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,460
don't focus on Asian like yes am let's

283
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:25,389
focus on this from part but in order to

284
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,880
create an environment where um I guess

285
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:30,220
where students can feel like they're

286
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,250
doing scrum without being inhibited by

287
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:38,380
their organizational impediments do

288
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:40,559
sprints on a product in class yes but

289
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,529
they actually there's no Lego

290
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:49,049
it's actually building software in the

291
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:53,490
class and I'm the thing that always is a

292
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:56,649
light bulb for me or at least firfer for

293
00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:01,779
my classes when students realize at the

294
00:24:56,649 --> 00:25:04,690
end and two hours working on the project

295
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:07,889
and they've created a website and

296
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:10,860
they've integrated five different

297
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:16,389
actually five different websites either

298
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:20,620
by the end hours of the product very

299
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:22,860
proud like what could you do in two

300
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,860
weeks

301
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:33,760
yes I think that many students are if

302
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,130
there aren't used to building things to

303
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,190
a done State there aren't if they're not

304
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:41,590
already accustomed to that for some it's

305
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:45,970
very hard to envision then it's even

306
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,240
possible yeah and I actually I this has

307
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,480
only happened once the one team one

308
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,940
class and I've taught a lot of PS apps

309
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,090
but I had one team at the end of the

310
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,940
Sprint

311
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:02,120
it's the first sprint you're the one

312
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,780
that's normally a car crash just give me

313
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,570
a URL and they had already created the

314
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,490
Dorothea created source control but the

315
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,280
website under source control

316
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,800
well added features to that website and

317
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:23,900
created a continuous delivery DevOps

318
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:31,790
pipeline live they were in production in

319
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:33,710
the first 30 that was well they they

320
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,950
spoiled you for the rest of your PSO

321
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,350
exactly because well I like to use them

322
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:42,140
as an example because if if a team of

323
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,670
five people regardless of what their

324
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,440
knowledge level was at the star

325
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:47,780
obviously they pick technology the

326
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,700
understood they'd already built DevOps

327
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,850
pipelines in the past they don't worked

328
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,610
with the tools and technology if in 30

329
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:03,440
minutes a team of five people in build

330
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:05,860
product and if it's a production what

331
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,860
seven

332
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:14,690
well and for those who attend who who

333
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:17,150
aren't currently working on a layer or

334
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:19,820
even higher in the organization for them

335
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:23,930
to see what is possible I find that

336
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,000
often it opens eyes to well if this is

337
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,190
actually possible then why aren't we

338
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,280
doing that what other organizational

339
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,010
impediments are exist that prevent these

340
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,550
people who are capable of doing such

341
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:41,800
great work from from delivering that

342
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:46,450
value to our customers more frequent

343
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:49,520
exactly and I think the PSF is a good

344
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:51,050
I'll ping in internally an organisation

345
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,810
so these are private classes I'll be

346
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:57,140
running high oh I don't think I've ever

347
00:27:53,810 --> 00:28:01,970
run a public this doesn't make sense for

348
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,350
me good it's generally you have a lot of

349
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:13,100
people in the class that are all from

350
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:16,010
the same all of that dirty laundry for

351
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,480
me it's a lot of fun oh I'm filling the

352
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,820
dirty laundry out of the drawer isn't

353
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,820
saying like look at the nasty this is

354
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:30,800
that's maybe I'm a bit of a masochist in

355
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:33,340
that way I like to cause trouble I think

356
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,550
you just like to expose the

357
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:41,210
opportunities and and so that the the

358
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:46,670
organisation can can then adapt that's

359
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:50,810
actually where a company from Ikeda

360
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:54,260
Jilla tea I read getting naked the art

361
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:57,920
of consulting a little bit called start

362
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:00,620
with why I'm those two together resulted

363
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:06,560
in what what I'm what I'm doing now when

364
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:08,830
I asked a Vox consultant to start start

365
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,830
my own

366
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,260
I didn't know the backstory for your

367
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:17,680
business thing but I did wonder if it

368

came from Lindsay oneis but nobody

369
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,470
nobody ever forgets the name of a

370
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:26,800
company I was embarrassed bookmarking it

firewall but I do have a customer it was

378
00:29:49,390 --> 00:30:00,310
actually my first customer when I moved

379
00:29:51,580 --> 00:30:02,800
back to the UK and we it was a PS f4 now

380
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,930
you won't get this reference I don't

381
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,040
know about how to translate it into you

382
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:14,230
bass but it was in a town called aiming

383
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:21,270
ham which is next to a town called a

384
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:25,780
grid and Grimsby as a perfect name it is

385
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:27,220
where all the chemical factories ER and

386
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:32,230
I was working with a shipping company

387
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:34,600
but it was M one of those everybody was

388
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,930
in fluorescent vests in the whole

389
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,520
company and small office that was almost

390
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,250
like a bunch of Port Evans stuck

391
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,380
together I was working with a small team

392
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:48,160
that had come in from all the different

393
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:50,290
ports around Northern Europe where where

394
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:57,040
they were based they come and eat

395
00:30:50,290 --> 00:31:00,310
together it's class and and I had a

396
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,230
sense of relief my first engagement in

397
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:08,020
the UK because I heard more swearing

398
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:14,230
that two-day class the night aired in

399
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:18,280
three years living in s rating because

400
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:21,040
people in the UAE and I think in most of

401
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,539
most of Europe aren't afraid of those

402
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,629
words I

403
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:29,619
books and bass are you'll like it's an

404
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:34,240
HR violation engine them whereas in the

405
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:39,909
UK it's often if you're aggressive

406
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:43,090
towards people or em opening towards

407
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:49,269
people then that's an HR violation but

408
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:53,279
just hurts on text of I stubbed my toe

409
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:53,279
or whatever those things are
