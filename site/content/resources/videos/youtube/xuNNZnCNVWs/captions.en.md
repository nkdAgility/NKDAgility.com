I think the main critical skill for a scrum Master is to be able to teach and teach things in a way that help people understand what it is not just the mechanics of how to do it. So actually teaching people and I think the why is that most people will resist things unless they understand why they should be doing a thing. What value do they get from it? 

Um, so being able to teach the fundamentals and have people understand they'll often come to the realization they need to do something different themselves.
