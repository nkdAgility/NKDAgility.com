Themes such as measurement, accountability, or outcome-driven strategic alignment typical of OKRs are absent. The main intent is practical tool advice for team facilitation, not outcome-based goal-setting as conceptualized by OKRs. While the audience (Agile practitioners, Scrum Masters) overlaps with those interested in OKRs, the subject matter remains largely unrelated.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on best practices for using digital whiteboards in Agile teams and does not discuss OKRs, their methodology, or strategic use. There is no meaningful exploration of Objective Key Results, resulting in very low relevance to the category.",

    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses digital whiteboards as collaboration tools for agile teams, offering practical advice for facilitation and team engagement. While it mentions concepts like team engagement and participation, it does not directly reference or sufficiently engage with Agentic Engineering principles including decentralised decision-making, observability, ethical AI integration, or maximising human and AI agency. The focus is on tools and workflow tips rather than deliberate engineering practice design intended to maximise agency. As a result, direct mentions are almost absent, and conceptual alignment/depth hover around the lower-mid range. The intended audience (practitioners, scrum masters) coincides with the category's typical audience, and the content stays focused, but the signal is primarily about practical usage rather than agentic philosophy.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article effectively targets agile practitioners and offers focused guidance on digital whiteboards, it only lightly aligns with Agentic Engineering. Key themes like maximising agency, decentralised decision-making, or ethical AI are not explicitly addressed.",

Its themes, intent, and target audience are centered on agile practitioners seeking to improve team engagement using collaboration tools. There are zero references or concept alignment to agentic software delivery as defined. No outdated practices or negative framing warranting penalties. Signal is low for relevance to the target category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article is about digital whiteboards for agile collaboration, not agentic software delivery. No AI agents, agency, contextual intelligence, or agentic practices are discussed. Therefore, fit is extremely low, with only minimal indirect audience overlap.",
