Scrum Masters love digital whiteboards. It doesn't matter what flavour; you can use any flavour you like. There's Mural, there's Miro, there's Lucid Spark, there's Clarkson, and there's a bunch of other ones out there, like Microsoft Whiteboards. 

Whatever one it is, building compelling interactive experiences for teams, for groups of people, for workshops, or just your daily scrum is something that you can do in a digital whiteboard. It really helps provide those kinds of information radiators and engagement with people. Digital whiteboards.
