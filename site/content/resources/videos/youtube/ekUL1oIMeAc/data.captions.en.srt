1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,839
so the worst product owner experience I

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,840
have ever seen

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,480
um was it a Sprint review

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,040
and the customer the stakeholders who

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
were in the room the customer was there

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,520
it turns to the development team after

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,980
the demo and said uh why why why why why

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,600
did you build it that way right and you

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,100
made choices that we didn't like why did

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,000
you build it that way

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,279
and instead of getting in front of and

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
supporting the team the product owner

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,980
instead turned to the development team

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,420
and said yes why did you build it that

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,399
way

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
product owner basically through the

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,739
whole team under the bus in the Sprint

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,739
review not a good position
