1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,339
okay

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,700
so the question was um what is the most

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,880
common aha moment

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,440
that people have in a scrum course and I

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,420
I think it actually depends on the scrum

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,699
course because there's quite a few

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,380
different different flavors

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,920
but I think

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,679
the biggest aha moment is the the the

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,980
total founding in empiricism that that

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,920
agility has and I see that time and time

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,520
again both

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,920
for for General agile and scrum when you

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,280
start talking to people in a training

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,980
class and explaining to them what's the

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,379
purpose of the events right causing the

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,719
feedback loop what's the purpose of the

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:01:00,420
the the the artifacts is to provide

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,280
transparency they start to realize that

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,600
they didn't understand what those things

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,000
are so that that kind of that

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
realization that oh I've been I've been

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,020
doing that wrong not because

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,119
I've been mechanically doing it wrong

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,960
but because I've not understood its

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,740
purpose I've not understood why this uh

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,439
uh thing is there and I've not valued it

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,080
right and so that that realization that

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,520
there is value in this thing that they

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,159
didn't even know was there even though

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,340
they've been doing it for years I was

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,640
teaching an APS today uh co-teaching

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,320
with Joanna and that that was a huge

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,060
realization for the for the for the

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,740
students there was that

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,799
um even the ones that I've been doing

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,240
I've been doing scrum for years

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,159
and then they're they're they're they're

39
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,320
hearing what we're saying they're

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,020
rereading the scrum guide and going

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,939
oh I totally didn't see the this this

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,979
that the empiricism was so important

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,920
that the scrum values were so important

44
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,799
that that this actually worked this now

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,380
you're explaining it it all makes sense

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,320
that the feedback loops and yeah that

47
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,239
that's probably the biggest aha moment

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,280
um and I think that

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,500
maybe it's just the way I teach it right

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,480
but that progresses across that one is a

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,379
staple for all the classes because at

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,599
some point you have to explain

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,000
empiricism and inspect and adapt and how

54
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,459
it interacts with scrum but when you

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,760
start layering on some of the other

56
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,040
capabilities and like hypothesis driven

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,120
practices hypothesis driven engineering

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,980
right

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,260
um that comes in with the PSU that's a

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,420
that's a big aha moment even because we

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,060
teach it in product owner as well as in

62
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,680
a more advanced in the PSU and that

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,340
realization

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,739
probably the the the the the

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,120
realization as well what the roles

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,459
aren't

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,099
that's actually a big big aha moment

68
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,120
that that people have and that's what I

69
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,680
love about the the advanced scrum Master

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,420
right is you you go into the advanced

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,160
scrum master and you immediately you

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,720
know put up that that

73
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,140
um uh uh the stances of the scum master

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,000
and it's the the negative scrum Master

75
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,140
stances and they say oh yeah you know

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
we've got that one and we've got this

77
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,599
one and we've got this one and I have to

78
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,580
do this one and I have to do that one

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,440
and then you've got that kind of it's

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,420
not really a reveal but that kind of

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
slow realization that oh you're putting

82
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,599
these up because these are the stances

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,640
we don't want

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,440
these are the stancies that that aren't

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,739
going to result in success that are

86
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,900
going to result in in in uh poor quality

87
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,000
and me not being an effective scrum

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,739
master and then we progress into the

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,239
stances that we do want what we're

90
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,760
trying to achieve and then go through it

91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,280
that that's a big aha moment in the the

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,540
psm2 so I like that one

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,099
and in the advanced product owner I

94
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,720
really like it's it's actually the same

95
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,599
thing you've got these set of stancies

96
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,620
which are the the the negative stancies

97
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,799
for the

98
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,440
product owner and then we reveal the and

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,379
dive deeply into I think this is our six

100
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,299
I think there's six stances of of you

101
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,180
know like the Steve Jobs type and the

102
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,260
customer focus and it's it's just that

103
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,700
realization that there's so much more to

104
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,760
the role

105
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,220
than they ever realized so from the aps

106
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,199
it's the team realizing there's so much

107
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,300
more to being in a scrum team and the

108
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,919
capability there's so much more to being

109
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,720
a product owner there's so much more to

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,000
being a scrum Master than they ever

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,160
realized before and for me that's the

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,960
big Epiphany moment in in all of the

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,580
classes that just continues every time

114
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,580
and it never gets old
