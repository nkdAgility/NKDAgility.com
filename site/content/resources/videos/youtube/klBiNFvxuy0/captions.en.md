okay

so the question was um what is the most common aha moment that people have in a scrum course and I I think it actually depends on the scrum course because there's quite a few different different flavors but I think the biggest aha moment is the the the total founding in empiricism that that agility has and I see that time and time again both for for General agile and scrum when you start talking to people in a training class and explaining to them what's the purpose of the events right causing the feedback loop what's the purpose of the the the artifacts is to provide transparency they start to realize that they didn't understand what those things are so that that kind of that realization that oh I've been I've been doing that wrong not because I've been mechanically doing it wrong but because I've not understood its purpose I've not understood why this uh uh thing is there and I've not valued it right and so that that realization that there is value in this thing that they didn't even know was there even though they've been doing it for years I was teaching an APS today uh co-teaching with Joanna and that that was a huge realization for the for the for the students there was that um even the ones that I've been doing I've been doing scrum for years and then they're they're they're they're hearing what we're saying they're rereading the scrum guide and going oh I totally didn't see the this this that the empiricism was so important that the scrum values were so important that that this actually worked this now you're explaining it it all makes sense that the feedback loops and yeah that that's probably the biggest aha moment um and I think that maybe it's just the way I teach it right but that progresses across that one is a staple for all the classes because at some point you have to explain empiricism and inspect and adapt and how it interacts with scrum but when you start layering on some of the other capabilities and like hypothesis driven practices hypothesis driven engineering right um that comes in with the PSU that's a that's a big aha moment even because we teach it in product owner as well as in a more advanced in the PSU and that realization probably the the the the the realization as well what the roles aren't that's actually a big big aha moment that that people have and that's what I love about the the advanced scrum Master right is you you go into the advanced scrum master and you immediately you know put up that that um uh uh the stances of the scum master and it's the the negative scrum Master stances and they say oh yeah you know we've got that one and we've got this one and we've got this one and I have to do this one and I have to do that one and then you've got that kind of it's not really a reveal but that kind of slow realization that oh you're putting these up because these are the stances we don't want these are the stancies that that aren't going to result in success that are going to result in in in uh poor quality and me not being an effective scrum master and then we progress into the stances that we do want what we're trying to achieve and then go through it that that's a big aha moment in the the psm2 so I like that one and in the advanced product owner I really like it's it's actually the same thing you've got these set of stancies which are the the the negative stancies for the product owner and then we reveal the and dive deeply into I think this is our six I think there's six stances of of you know like the Steve Jobs type and the customer focus and it's it's just that realization that there's so much more to the role than they ever realized so from the aps it's the team realizing there's so much more to being in a scrum team and the capability there's so much more to being a product owner there's so much more to being a scrum Master than they ever realized before and for me that's the big Epiphany moment in in all of the classes that just continues every time and it never gets old
