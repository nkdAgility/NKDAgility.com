# What is the most common Aha moment people have in a scrum course?

#agile is a radical departure from traditional #projectmanagement because you are no longer following a plan by rote, simply doing as you are told. You need to be engaged, you need to effectively contribute, and you need to collaborate with others to solve complex problems and build complex solutions.

It's never been solved before. It has never been built before. So, you can't follow a formula, you need to invent and experiment to discover the best answer. This is where #scrum comes into it's own.

Empirical Process Control or #empiricism underpins #scrum and helps #productdevelopment teams embrace volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity as part of the #productdevelopment process.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the AHA moments that are common to delegates on a #scrum course. The epiphanies that help the content land and give it practical and actionable application in the real world.
