 Overcoming Scope Creep: Focus on Value, Not Fixed Scope | Martin Hinshelwood

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I address a common challenge in project and product management: scope creep. The problem often lies in using outdated practices designed for low-variance environments, where the plan is predictable. Iâ€™ll show you how shifting to an Agile mindset and focusing on value deliveryâ€”rather than rigid scope and deadlinesâ€”can help you adapt to change and stay on track.

ðŸ“Œ Chapters:

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Scope Creep Happens
2. 02:30 â€“ The Problem with Fixed Scope in High-Variance Environments
3. 05:15 â€“ Moving to a Product Operating Model
4. 08:00 â€“ How Agile Helps Manage Change and Evolving Needs
5. 11:00 â€“ Why Value Delivery is More Important Than Fixed Scope
6. 14:00 â€“ Planning for Flexibility: Backlogs, Vision, and Direction
7. 17:00 â€“ Managing Budget and Time in Agile Contexts

ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:

â€¢ Product managers and project managers struggling with shifting requirements
â€¢ Organizations transitioning from traditional project management to Agile practices
â€¢ Teams looking to balance changing customer needs with delivery timelines
â€¢ Agile practitioners seeking strategies to improve adaptability and focus on value

ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:

â€¢ Why traditional tools like Gantt charts fail in high-variance environments
â€¢ How Agile and Lean principles help you adapt to scope changes
â€¢ The importance of focusing on value delivery over fixed scope
â€¢ How to manage time and budget effectively in Agile projects
â€¢ Strategies for using product vision and dynamic backlogs to stay aligned

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

â€¢ Scope creep is often a sign youâ€™re working in a dynamic environment where fixed plans donâ€™t apply.
â€¢ Agile focuses on delivering value by adapting to change rather than resisting it.
â€¢ A clear product vision and flexible backlog enable teams to pivot effectively.
â€¢ Success in Agile isnâ€™t measured by sticking to a rigid plan but by delivering value to customers.
