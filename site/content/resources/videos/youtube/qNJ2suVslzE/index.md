If you're grappling with scope creep, you're not alone. It's a common challenge that many teams face, and often, it stems from relying on outdated practices and philosophies that were designed for a world of low variance. In environments where change is minimal, creating a detailed plan or Gantt chart seems effective. You can run the plan, manage risks, and feel in control. However, when the variance—the gap between your expectations and reality—exceeds 50%, those traditional tools start to falter, leading to the dreaded scope creep.

### Understanding Scope Creep

Scope creep isn't just a buzzword; it's a symptom of a deeper issue. When we cling to old ideas of fixed scope and deadlines, we miss the point of what we're trying to achieve: delivering a usable, working product that provides value to our customers. The reality is that the market is dynamic. Whether you're delivering a product to a business or a consumer, the ecosystem is constantly evolving. This means that what you need to deliver is also in a state of flux.

- **Continuous Change**: The requirements for your product will change over time. This could be in response to feedback from stakeholders or shifts in market demand. For instance, you might showcase a feature to your users, and they might respond with, "That's great, but now I need something entirely different." This is the ebb and flow of product development.

- **Agility in Action**: This is precisely why Agile methodologies were developed. The Lean movement, which originated from the Toyota Production System, recognised the need for flexibility in production. Agile adapted these principles for software delivery, where change is not only possible but often necessary.

### Shifting the Conversation

If you're finding yourself in discussions about scope creep, it might be time to rethink the conversation. Instead of viewing scope as a fixed entity, we should embrace the idea that scope can—and should—change. Here are a few key points to consider:

- **Value Over Scope**: Our focus should shift from managing scope to delivering value. If we prioritise value, we can adapt our plans and resources to meet the evolving needs of our customers.

- **Dynamic Planning**: In an Agile context, we manage budget and time differently. With a clear product vision and a well-defined backlog that we know will change, we can plan effectively while remaining flexible. This allows us to pivot as needed without the stress of rigid scope constraints.

- **Embrace Feedback**: Regularly engaging with stakeholders and users can provide invaluable insights. Their feedback can guide your development process, ensuring that you're always aligned with their needs.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, if you're struggling with scope creep, it may be a sign that you're still operating under outdated paradigms. Embrace the Agile mindset, where change is not only expected but welcomed. By focusing on delivering value and maintaining a flexible approach to planning, you can navigate the complexities of product delivery with confidence. Remember, the goal is not to stick to a predetermined scope but to ensure that what you deliver meets the needs of your customers in a rapidly changing environment. 

Let’s shift our focus from scope to value, and in doing so, we can transform our approach to product delivery and ultimately achieve greater success.
