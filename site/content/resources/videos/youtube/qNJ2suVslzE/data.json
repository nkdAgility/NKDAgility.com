    "description": "Overcoming Scope Creep: Focus on Value, Not Fixed Scope | Martin Hinshelwood\n\nðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I address a common challenge in project and product management: scope creep. The problem often lies in using outdated practices designed for low-variance environments, where the plan is predictable. Iâ€™ll show you how shifting to an Agile mindset and focusing on value deliveryâ€”rather than rigid scope and deadlinesâ€”can help you adapt to change and stay on track.\n\nðŸ“Œ Chapters:\n\n1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Scope Creep Happens\n2. 02:30 â€“ The Problem with Fixed Scope in High-Variance Environments\n3. 05:15 â€“ Moving to a Product Operating Model\n4. 08:00 â€“ How Agile Helps Manage Change and Evolving Needs\n5. 11:00 â€“ Why Value Delivery is More Important Than Fixed Scope\n6. 14:00 â€“ Planning for Flexibility: Backlogs, Vision, and Direction\n7. 17:00 â€“ Managing Budget and Time in Agile Contexts\n\nðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:\n\nâ€¢ Product managers and project managers struggling with shifting requirements\nâ€¢ Organizations transitioning from traditional project management to Agile practices\nâ€¢ Teams looking to balance changing customer needs with delivery timelines\nâ€¢ Agile practitioners seeking strategies to improve adaptability and focus on value\n\nðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:\n\nâ€¢ Why traditional tools like Gantt charts fail in high-variance environments\nâ€¢ How Agile and Lean principles help you adapt to scope changes\nâ€¢ The importance of focusing on value delivery over fixed scope\nâ€¢ How to manage time and budget effectively in Agile projects\nâ€¢ Strategies for using product vision and dynamic backlogs to stay aligned\n\nðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:\n\nâ€¢ Scope creep is often a sign youâ€™re working in a dynamic environment where fixed plans donâ€™t apply.\nâ€¢ Agile focuses on delivering value by adapting to change rather than resisting it.\nâ€¢ A clear product vision and flexible backlog enable teams to pivot effectively.\nâ€¢ Success in Agile isnâ€™t measured by sticking to a rigid plan but by delivering value to customers.\n\n\nAt NKD Agility, we help teams and organizations embrace Agile principles to focus on value delivery and overcome challenges like scope creep.
