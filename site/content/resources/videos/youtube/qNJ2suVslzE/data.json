    "description": "Overcoming Scope Creep: Focus on Value, Not Fixed Scope | Martin Hinshelwood\n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I address a common challenge in project and product management: scope creep. The problem often lies in using outdated practices designed for low-variance environments, where the plan is predictable. I’ll show you how shifting to an Agile mindset and focusing on value delivery, rather than rigid scope and deadlines, can help you adapt to change and stay on track.\n\n📌 Chapters:\n\n1. 00:00 – Introduction: Why Scope Creep Happens\n2. 02:30 – The Problem with Fixed Scope in High-Variance Environments\n3. 05:15 – Moving to a Product Operating Model\n4. 08:00 – How Agile Helps Manage Change and Evolving Needs\n5. 11:00 – Why Value Delivery is More Important Than Fixed Scope\n6. 14:00 – Planning for Flexibility: Backlogs, Vision, and Direction\n7. 17:00 – Managing Budget and Time in Agile Contexts\n\n🎯 Who This Video is For:\n\n• Product managers and project managers struggling with shifting requirements\n• Organizations transitioning from traditional project management to Agile practices\n• Teams looking to balance changing customer needs with delivery timelines\n• Agile practitioners seeking strategies to improve adaptability and focus on value\n\n📖 What You’ll Learn:\n\n• Why traditional tools like Gantt charts fail in high-variance environments\n• How Agile and Lean principles help you adapt to scope changes\n• The importance of focusing on value delivery over fixed scope\n• How to manage time and budget effectively in Agile projects\n• Strategies for using product vision and dynamic backlogs to stay aligned\n\n💡 Key Takeaways:\n\n• Scope creep is often a sign you’re working in a dynamic environment where fixed plans don’t apply.\n• Agile focuses on delivering value by adapting to change rather than resisting it.\n• A clear product vision and flexible backlog enable teams to pivot effectively.\n• Success in Agile isn’t measured by sticking to a rigid plan but by delivering value to customers.\n\n\nAt NKD Agility, we help teams and organizations embrace Agile principles to focus on value delivery and overcome challenges like scope creep.
