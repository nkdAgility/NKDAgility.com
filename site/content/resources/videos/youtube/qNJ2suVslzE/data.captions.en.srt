1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,120
if you're struggling with scope creep

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:09,840
it's probably because you're

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,000
using uh practices and philosophies that

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,400
were developed within the context of low

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,840
variance right very little changes all

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,720
the time so you can create a plan you

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,240
can create your your your Gant chart you

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,240
can run the plan and that's how you're

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,920
managing risk but when your your your

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,039
variance the difference between what you

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,760
think's going to happen and what

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,559
actually happens is bigger than what you

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,879
thought in the first place more than 50%

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,719
variance those tools no longer work and

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,920
we start having problems with scope

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:51,160
creep right it it we start to not be in

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,520
control of what's going on and that

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,000
shift

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,600
towards product delivery a product

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,720
operating model is that move

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,720
away from those old ideas of scope and

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,880
deadlines right there's there's other

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,960
tools that we use to have the same

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,320
outcome right because the outcome you're

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,680
looking for is usable working product in

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,560
the hands of your customers so that

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,960
you're delivering value right maximizing

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,479
the value of that

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,640
item

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,520
but those are those old tools are no

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,640
longer working for us if if you're

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,079
having a conversation about scope creep

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,360
then we're probably having The Wrong

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,159
conversation because it needs to be okay

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,000
for the scope to change because the

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,119
market doesn't stay still if you're

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,280
delivering a product into your

38
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,560
organization or into a market right

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,560
whether it's B2B or b2c or internal then

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,880
the ecosystem within which you're

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,560
delivering that product is changing over

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,960
time it's not only changing over time

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,439
continuously but that means that what

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,000
what you need is changing continuously

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,360
which means that what you have to do is

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,040
changing continuously and it might even

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,160
change in response to something you show

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,760
the stakeholders right you show the

49
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,160
customers you show the users you show

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,080
them a capability and they're like oh

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,599
yeah that's awesome don't spend any more

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,480
time on that this is the next most

53
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,959
important thing and suddenly we're

54
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,319
shifting Direction and maybe there's a

55
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
hundred things in your in your list of

56
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,319
things to do

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,480
that you know don't need right so that

58
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,959
scope creep the good way where we have

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,080
less scope to deal with but also that

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,599
you might show them something and

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,080
they're like oh that's not not what I

62
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,720
want I need something completely

63
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,360
different and suddenly you've got a

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,640
whole bunch of additional

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:57,840
work that e and flow of what needs to

66
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:01,280
be is the reason that agile was created

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,360
right so the lean movement came out of

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,200
that story of EB and flow of delivering

69
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,440
products right lean Toyota system and

70
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,120
agile was the adaptation of that story

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,400
Into the context of software delivery

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,519
which is which is slightly different

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,319
right it's much easier to change

74
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,239
software it's much easier to iterate on

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,239
software you can ship a new it's

76
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,319
difficult to ship a new car to the same

77
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,879
Customer because you you want to change

78
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,920
something than it is to do it for for

79
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:34,920
software so that this idea if we want to

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,280
be on time and on

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,879
budget then we need to consider scope to

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,560
be not the thing we're looking for we're

83
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,760
looking for Value the thing we're

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,879
focusing on is delivering value to our

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,079
customers and if we're delivering value

86
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,840
we're doing the right thing and we

87
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,680
manage budget and time differently

88
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,200
within the context of agile so if we

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,120
have a clear product vision a clear

90
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,799
Direction on where we're going and a

91
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,680
welldefined PCT backlog that we know is

92
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,000
going to change constantly then we can

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,120
much more effectively plan what we're

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,079
doing and change direction as needed

95
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,079
without worrying about scope
