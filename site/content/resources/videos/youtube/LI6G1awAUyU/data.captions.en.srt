1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,639
so the question is what are the most

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,460
common challenges you are contracted to

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,920
solve in a devops Consulting geek

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,740
ah man it's pretty much the same as an

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,580
agile Consulting geek right it's it's

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,500
people aren't seeing working

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,300
products quickly enough

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,340
right they aren't they aren't able to

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,460
use the things that the teams are

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,899
creating perhaps it takes too long

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,300
to get from from an idea to delivery of

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,120
working product or even just just too

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,800
long from we've finished the product to

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,320
we can actually get it in front of our

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,239
customers and how do we close those

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,000
those feedback loops because that that

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,500
fundamentally

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,960
devops is coming at the story

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,620
the agile tells

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,199
from the perspective of people who are

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,500
delivering the product right the the the

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,600
the the actual delivery teams who are

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,860
getting the product through trying to

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,000
get the product through the production

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,400
line of of delivery and

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,840
the most common challenges or how do you

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
make that faster how do you automate

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,619
that process which which means people

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
often think about devops as purely about

30
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,540
the automation

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,180
but there's a lot of uh a mindset and

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,540
understanding lean agile practitioner

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,340
behind the story of devops that enables

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,159
you to make different choices and have

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,560
different understandings it's it's the

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,799
same reason that that synovsky had to

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,320
drag the windows team Kicking and

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,180
Screaming was his comment to shipping a

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,899
new version of Windows after Windows 8

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,220
right Windows 8.1 was a year later but

41
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,320
they didn't want to do it they're like

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,299
you can't release a new version of

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,880
Windows within a year can can you

44
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,100
imagine working on a product and

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,960
believing wholeheartedly that you can't

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,540
ship a new version within a year you

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,160
can't make one code change and ship it

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,000
to production within a year that's

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,099
that's an incredible

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,379
length of time for that to be true and

51
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:20,760
devops is really about closing those

52
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,920
feedback Clips getting that that oh

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,200
depends how you think about devops right

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,480
again I always come back to that that

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,640
story are you an agile practitioner

56
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
looking at devops are you our devops

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,660
practitioner looking at agile right

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,520
because a devops practitioner will say

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,200
that agile is part of the devops story

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,180
and an agile practitioner will say that

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,640
devops is part of the agile story right

62
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,980
that's that's different lenses they're

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,599
different perspectives but it's all the

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,239
same thing so I don't really count it as

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,519
a any different between it I do this

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,260
report for for organizations where I

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,540
analyze what they're doing and I call it

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,220
the the state of agile report if they

69
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,260
asked for an agile report in the state

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,700
of devops report if they asked for a

71
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,280
devops report and it's the same report

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,660
right it's the same story that I'm

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,080
telling it's all about shortening

74
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,879
feedback loops it's about uh getting

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,480
product in the hands of your customers

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,980
more quickly it's about think of all the

77
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,720
different feedback loops how long does

78
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,519
it take your developers to to to to

79
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,200
validate that the code they've just

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
written actually works

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,580
right I know teams where where that's 48

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,080
hours because of the tests they have to

83
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,940
run because their testing infrastructure

84
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,680
Is Not Great perhaps that should be

85
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,780
Rewritten

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,800
um for me the most most common

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,599
challenges are are anytime the customer

88
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,560
says

89
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,500
or anybody at the customer says

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,780
but in our

91
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:50,640
industry World company

92
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,920
we can't do thing because of some other

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
reason right those those are the big

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,760
challenges it actually doesn't matter

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
what you fill those gaps with they're

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,239
they're the big challenges most most

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,540
commonly

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,480
um is is we can't

99
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:10,500
um have developers shipping product into

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,420
production because of our

101
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,700
um you know we're a regulated industry

102
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,620
and we need to blah blah whatever

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,799
bollocks blah blah blah blah blah right

104
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,860
because because it's just fundamentally

105
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,820
not true if you go look on the azure

106
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,500
devops website uh at least the last time

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,120
I looked there were a bunch of articles

108
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,160
on

109
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,500
um socks audits

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,600
um and a bunch of articles on other uh

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,000
and I think there's the the federal drug

112
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,040
the US drug

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,259
stuff like you have to comply with a

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,540
bunch of stuff right

115
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,880
there's there's no mandate that a

116
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,919
different person has to test it from the

117
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,020
person that codied it not in any of

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,060
those actual things there's actually

119
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,900
socks on it is the big one right because

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,860
it's the financial world and it

121
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,080
it's crazy to think that an auditor

122
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,120
right who's a financial auditor would

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,040
understand anything about software and

124
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,320
put some restriction on and they don't

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,780
and the same is true for everything it

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,180
get the auditor in the room and ask them

127
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,160
the question if we do it like this

128
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,520
instead of like this is that still okay

129
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,139
and 90 of the times are like yeah it is

130
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,900
right yeah that sounds that sounds like

131
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,460
it gets me the same stuff I need in fact

132
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,039
that sounds like more than I need that's

133
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,020
pretty good right and that almost almost

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
100 of the time that's that's my

135
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,479
experience working with compliance in

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,060
companies external Auditors is that they

137
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,919
don't have the Outlook that you think

138
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,259
they do because you make we make a sound

139
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,360
pins and we don't ask them so the

140
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,800
biggest biggest common challenges are we

141
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,419
can't do that here

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,560
that's the biggest challenge and it

143
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,020
doesn't matter what it is it's always

144
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,419
the same challenge right

145
