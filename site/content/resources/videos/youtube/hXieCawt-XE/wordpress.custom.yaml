  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When implementing a Kanban strategy, we're essentially creating a pull-based system of work. This methodology, which originated in lean manufacturing, offers teams a structured way to visualize, manage, and improve their workflow. If you're struggling with bottlenecks, work piling up, or inefficiencies in your process, Kanban might be exactly what you need.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In this post, I'll dive into the three core practices of Kanban, how to define and visualize workflows effectively, and the importance of work-in-progress (WIP) limits. I‚Äôll also share personal advice on how to overcome some common challenges teams face when implementing a Kanban strategy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-kanban\"><strong>What is Kanban?</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. Teams using Kanban define stages in their workflow, set limits on how much work can happen in each stage, and continuously improve their process.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-three-core-practices-of-kanban\"><strong>The Three Core Practices of Kanban</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":1} -->\r\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Defining and Visualizing the Workflow</strong> ‚Äì Teams start by mapping out the stages that their work passes through.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Actively Managing Items in the Workflow</strong> ‚Äì Teams must monitor the flow of work and take action when bottlenecks arise.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Improving the Workflow</strong> ‚Äì Continuous improvement is at the heart of Kanban, and teams should always look for ways to enhance efficiency.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-defining-your-kanban-system\"><strong>Defining Your Kanban System</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To build an effective Kanban system, it‚Äôs crucial to first decide what system you‚Äôre going to use Kanban to monitor. Many teams define their workflow with simple columns like ‚ÄúTo Do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù But here‚Äôs a key point: <strong>just defining columns doesn‚Äôt make it a Kanban system</strong>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>A true Kanban strategy requires more depth. At a minimum, you need to establish work-in-progress (WIP) limits, visualize waiting states, and focus on flow management.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-wip-limits\"><strong>The Importance of WIP Limits</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At the core of Kanban is the principle of limiting work in progress (WIP). Without WIP limits, you‚Äôre not really following Kanban. Why? Because WIP limits prevent teams from overloading the system and allow them to focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-wip-limits-matter\"><strong>Why WIP Limits Matter</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üõë <strong>Prevent bottlenecks</strong>: If you don‚Äôt cap the number of items in a stage, work can pile up, slowing down the entire process.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üìä <strong>Focus on flow</strong>: By limiting how much work is in progress, teams can focus on moving tasks through the system efficiently.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Example: Hospital Waiting Rooms</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Imagine you walk into a hospital waiting room, but all the seats are taken. The overflow room fills up, and people start waiting longer than expected. Hospital managers might realize that they‚Äôve booked too many patients for a particular time slot. In response, they could adjust the schedule to reduce wait times.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This is how we should approach workflow in Kanban. When we see a stage in our process filling up, it's a sign that there‚Äôs too much work in the system and we need to adjust.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understanding-waiting-states-in-kanban\"><strong>Understanding Waiting States in Kanban</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Kanban also helps teams identify <strong>waiting states</strong>, or places where work stops because the next stage is full. A waiting state occurs when one stage completes its work, but the next stage can‚Äôt take on new items.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, let‚Äôs say your team has three stages: analysis, development, and testing. Once the analysis team finishes their part, they may place items in the development queue. But if development is already at its WIP limit, those items sit in a waiting state.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-visualizing-waiting-states\"><strong>Visualizing Waiting States</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To prevent work from piling up, you need to visualize these waiting states. A common approach is to create ‚Äúdone‚Äù columns for each stage. For instance:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Analysis Doing</strong></li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Analysis Done</strong></li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When items are in the \"Analysis Done\" column, they‚Äôre waiting for the development team to pull them into their workflow.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>By visualizing waiting states like this, teams can see when work starts to pile up and take action to fix the flow.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-problem-with-push-systems\"><strong>The Problem with Push Systems</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In a push system, one team might \"push\" work into the next stage without permission, overloading that stage. This creates chaos, as the next stage might already be full, causing delays.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Kanban, on the other hand, operates as a <strong>pull system</strong>, where each stage only pulls work when it‚Äôs ready to handle it. This ensures that the system remains efficient and prevents overload.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-actively-managing-the-workflow\"><strong>Actively Managing the Workflow</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>A critical part of Kanban is actively managing items in the workflow. Teams need to regularly review their Kanban board to identify bottlenecks and take corrective action.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-handling-bottlenecks\"><strong>Handling Bottlenecks</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If a stage is getting overloaded, the team should stop and address the issue. For example, if the development team is overwhelmed, the analysis team may need to stop working until the development queue clears. This helps to avoid building up a backlog of work that can‚Äôt be processed.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üî¥ <strong>Raise the red flag</strong>: If one part of the process is blocked, teams should raise a red flag and pause new work.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>ü§ù <strong>Collaborate</strong>: In some cases, the team from the previous stage can jump in to help.

Imagine a done column that keeps getting larger and larger, with no one addressing the overflow. This kind of waste can seriously affect the speed at which work flows through the system.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be better if teams stopped and said, \"We‚Äôve hit our limit; let's address this before moving forward\"?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-power-of-continuous-improvement\"><strong>The Power of Continuous Improvement</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Kanban isn‚Äôt just about managing work; it‚Äôs about <strong>constantly improving the process</strong>. If bottlenecks or waiting states keep occurring, it‚Äôs a sign that the system needs improvement.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-improve-the-workflow\"><strong>How to Improve the Workflow</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üõ† <strong>Analyze constraints</strong>: Look for stages where work gets stuck and figure out why.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üë• <strong>Collaborate with leadership</strong>: If there‚Äôs a systemic issue, bring it to leadership‚Äôs attention and work together on a solution.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>üìà <strong>Measure and adapt</strong>: Use flow metrics to monitor the system and make data-driven improvements.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-applying-kanban-in-scrum-teams\"><strong>Applying Kanban in Scrum Teams</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Interestingly, Kanban strategies can be applied in Scrum teams as well. Scrum already has a built-in pull system, where developers select work during Sprint Planning. However, adding Kanban on top of Scrum can offer an extra layer of visibility and flow management.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>By breaking down the activities within a Sprint into Kanban stages, teams can see exactly where work is getting stuck and address it quickly.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts-why-kanban-matters\"><strong>Final Thoughts: Why Kanban Matters</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Kanban helps teams visualize, manage, and improve their workflow by creating a pull-based system. It prevents overloading stages with work, ensures smoother flow, and provides visibility into where bottlenecks are occurring.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you're struggling with creating an efficient workflow, Kanban can help. Whether you're implementing a full Kanban system or adding Kanban principles to Scrum, the key is to actively manage and continuously improve your process. üëâ <strong>Pro tip</strong>: Always set WIP limits and keep an eye on waiting states to prevent bottlenecks from derailing your progress!</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
