1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,359
when you're implementing a caman

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,360
strategy we're effectively creating uh a

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,840
pool-based system of

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,440
work so

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,840
um cban kind of does this there there's

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,960
three core practices to caman defining

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,359
and visualizing your workflow actively

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,640
managing items in that workflow and then

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:31,599
improving that workflow and our

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,000
ability to Define and visualize that

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,640
workflow as part of creating that caman

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,840
system we need to decide what is the

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,000
system that we're going to use caman a

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,320
caman strategy to monitor right so we

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
Define generally and you'll see this a

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,520
lot with teams as they'll Define columns

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,840
if they just stop there it's probably

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,600
not a caman system yet right it's not a

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,559
cand strategy if they just Define The

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,000
Columns and then we're done there's a

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,519
little bit more to it than that and some

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,199
of the minimum things things uh uh that

23
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:06,760
you kind of need at a minimum you should

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,759
have whip limits right at Absolute

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,960
minimum you should have whip limits

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,600
those other things we should have but

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,400
definitely if you don't have whip limits

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,840
definitely not not don't have a cand

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,240
system yet

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,720
but what we're able to do is we're able

31
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,479
to decide what of the stages that our

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,200
work flows through but we also want to

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:31,000
think about what are our weight States

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,159
and weight states are places where work

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,799
stops because the next thing that needs

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,040
to happen the next activity the next

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:45,719
stage in the process is um is full right

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,960
there's no no capacity if you think

39
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,840
about um I'm trying to trying to think

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,759
of a of a good example good example is

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,560
uh if you go to the hospital and you go

42
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,360
to the waiting room and there are no

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,759
seats left quite often there'll be a

44
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,640
another

45
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,280
overflow waiting room uh where where

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,239
people can go and wait to get into that

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,239
that that situation and then the people

48
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,400
running that department in the hospital

49
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,000
are going to be looking at well how many

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
people end up in this overflow they're

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,879
they're all wait they're they're waiting

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,280
longer than we expect because

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,680
everybody's waiting longer than we

54
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,160
expect and we don't want too many things

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,840
in the system perhaps we need to reduce

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,280
the number of people that we uh Book on

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,239
a particular schedule right in order to

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,000
Maxim minimize the amount of time people

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,360
wait and maximize the amount of people

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,080
we get through the system um and they

61
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,519
well that's more difficult for hospitals

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,000
because they have to take into account

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,040
people that cancel people that don't

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,640
turn up all of those kind of things so

65
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,800
um yeah that's that's fun but this this

66
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,680
idea of um the weight state is really

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,680
important so quite often for a stage

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,000
let's let's use a really

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,760
simple visualization uh where you've got

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,680
some kind of analysis Discovery happens

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,879
then some sort of development or doing

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,280
happens and then some kind of validation

73
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,319
or testing happens and then things are

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,360
finished you want to be able to indicate

75
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,480
on your board in your visualization in

76
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,720
your system visualizing your system when

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,560
things are complete from the perspective

78
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,760
Ive of analysis right um but they've

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,120
we've not yet

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:47,360
started development doing work on it so

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,599
if the analysis team just put it into

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,720
the development teams and I'm using

83
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,200
teams badly here but the people doing

84
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,439
analysis put it into the backlog of the

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,239
people doing development they're

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,920
committing to that work on that other

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,079
group's BAS behalf right they're putting

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,799
it in their system inside of their view

89
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,319
um without permission they're just put

90
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,599
dropping it in there even if they ask

91
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,159
they're they're kind of pushing that

92
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,200
system that's a push system if we want

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,280
to create a pool system then the folks

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,160
in the stage before so in this case

95
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,799
analysis they want to kind of have an

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
analysis doing and an analysis done

97
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,600
indication and that analysis done is a

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,880
weight State for the the the the the

99
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,560
next stage to look at that list of

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,759
things that are done from the previous

101
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,440
stage and then pull them in but it still

102
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,759
counts as time in that previous stage

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,720
that way we can see when visually see

104
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,360
when work piles up and see when we need

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,320
to do something about it like the

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Overflow in the waiting room at the

107
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,680
hospital we want to be able to take

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
action right we want to actively manage

109
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,000
the items in the workflow which means

110
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
we're going to be looking for those

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,600
weight States we're going to be looking

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,479
for work piling up and you might find if

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,120
we're limiting work in process which we

114
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,600
should be in a cband system then if the

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,919
the the

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,160
development activity has four things

117
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:20,440
that they can take and the analysis

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:24,600
activity has four things then perhaps

119
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:28,240
the analysis work stops because they

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,720
have four things in done and the

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,440
development activity has more things in

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,880
progress slash done and we can't take on

123
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,880
anymore and Analysis can't take anymore

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,240
cuz their whip is four and they then

125
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,639
stop working and they say

126
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,600
to the system we don't have anything

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,759
left to do we we can't start new work

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,880
because we don't have room in our

129
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,880
system right and you might think that

130
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,520
well surely they can just take on

131
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,360
something else

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,960
but what if they keep doing that and

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,919
don't stop and put up the flag and alert

134
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,120
that we've stopped work what if they

135
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,680
just keep going so they keep pulling

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,360
work and dropping it into their done

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,360
column and their done column just gets

138
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,240
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,840
and perhaps the next stage can't pull

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,639
from that list very quickly and it means

141
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,080
that the weight time the amount of total

142
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,039
time in the system for all of those

143
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,599
things that are in that weight state is

144
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,160
getting longer and longer and longer and

145
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,440
it's just waste wouldn't it be better if

146
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,479
though that group in analysis just put

147
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,080
up the red flag and said uh We've

148
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,960
stopped because we've got no more room

149
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,919
in our system the next stage has not

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,919
filtered more down what should we do

151
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,520
right now in reality if you're a

152
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,879
engineering team working together

153
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,280
perhaps they go help the next stage down

154
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,720
the r line right maybe they can help out

155
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,440
and help make that FAS faster or perhaps

156
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,240
we need to bring this up as a a bigger

157
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,479
thing for leadership and say we've got

158
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,199
some kind of problem in the system and

159
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,759
we need to change the system in order to

160
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,720
make it more effective so the things

161
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
that we bring into the system flow

162
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,599
through the system more quickly so by

163
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,199
creating a pool system um we actually

164
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,840
create a

165
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,440
system within which we can see we can

166
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,280
visually see when we're not when the

167
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,400
system's not flowing properly when the

168
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,000
engine's not working properly it will

169
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,759
back up and it will back up all the way

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,639
to a point where we're like okay

171
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:43,039
everybody in this line of all every

172
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,000
single activity is is effectively

173
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,919
blocked right it's not a blocked thing

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,039
but everything is constrained and then

175
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,479
oh this is where it's constrained

176
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,800
because they're still working and

177
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,360
everybody after them has stopped what's

178
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,039
the problem do we not have enough people

179
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,400
here to be able to process the amount of

180
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,280
work that's going on um are we taking on

181
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,520
too much work into the system so it's

182
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,720
flowing through too quickly for this

183
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,000
whatever the constraint is in this area

184
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,159
and we need to figure out what it is and

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,159
go fix it so

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:24,639
this Dynamic applies both for a caman

187
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:26,639
strategy right you want to be looking

188
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,840
for those stages and thinking about how

189
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
do we visualize them uh but it also

190
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,760
applies in the the scrum world as well

191
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,039
scrum has a weight State H built in um

192
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,039
because the developers select work

193
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,640
during Sprint planning right so that's

194
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,680
their moment for for pulling work into

195
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,000
the system and then the system runs and

196
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,120
we see what comes out the other end so

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,640
we can apply a cband strategy on top of

198
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,320
that as well in addition to uh the work

199
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,880
limited pool system that's implemented

200
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,959
by scrum and add additional work limited

201
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,320
pool systems so that inside of the

202
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,519
system that scrum creates we can break

203
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,519
it up into other activities that in

204
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:09,000
order allow us to see what's going on in

205
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,839
those activities and where within the

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,160
system that's implemented by scrum where

207
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,519
the actual activities are are are

208
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
blocked are stuck are constrained that

209
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,720
we need to take action and we need to

210
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,200
fulfill that final part of a cand

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
strategy uh which is improving the

212
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,399
workflow not just actively managing it

213
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,120
but improving it so we need to go uh

214
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,839
take action and make a change if you're

215
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,360
struggling to create a pool-based system

216
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,560
of work then we can help you we provide
