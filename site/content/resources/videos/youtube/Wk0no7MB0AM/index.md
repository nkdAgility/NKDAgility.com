# War! 7 Harbingers agile apocalypse. But shorter!

War is one of the seven signs of the Agile-pocolypse! ⚔️

As an Agile expert, I'm passionate about helping teams to succeed. And that includes helping them to resolve conflict and create a positive and productive work environment.

In this video, I'm going to give you some tips on how to de-escalate team conflict and prevent it from turning into a full-blown war.
But first, let's talk about why conflict happens in the first place.

Agile teams are made up of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. That's a good thing! It's what makes Agile teams so innovative and successful. But it can also lead to conflict, especially when people have different ideas about how to get things done.

So, conflict is normal. It's how we learn and grow. But if it's not managed effectively, it can damage team morale and productivity.
So, what can you do to de-escalate team conflict?

Here are a few tips:
• Talk to the team members involved and try to understand the root of the conflict. What are their underlying concerns? What are they trying to achieve?
• Encourage team members to communicate with each other respectfully and openly. This means listening to each other's perspectives, even if you disagree with them.
• Help team members to find common ground and compromise. This may involve brainstorming solutions together or finding a middle ground that everyone can accept.
• Mediate between team members if necessary. This can be helpful if team members are unable to resolve the conflict on their own.
• If the conflict is severe, it may be necessary to bring in a professional mediator or coach.

It's important to remember that conflict is not the end of the world. In fact, it can be a valuable opportunity for team members to learn from each other and grow. By taking action to de-escalate conflict and promote a culture of cooperation, you can help your team to succeed.
Now, go out there and create some Agile peace and prosperity! ✌️
