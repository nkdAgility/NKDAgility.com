00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,639
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,840
apocalypse is war this manifests as team

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,240
conflict it's fine to have disagreements

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,199
on your team that's where the awesome

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,800
ideas are generated but if it escalates

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,119
to a contest right the aim becomes to

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,400
win the argument that's the line at

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,599
which uh the scrum Master probably needs

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,279
to step in and help um if it gets to

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,520
Crusade or World War uh with the teams

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,360
then you're just hosed um you need to

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,640
deescalate that so one of the seven

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,280
