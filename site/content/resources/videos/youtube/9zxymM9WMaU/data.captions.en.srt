00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,440
okay

9
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,399
foreign

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,160
thank you

11
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,720
blah blah blah

12
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,720
hey manjit

13
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,720
hey

14
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,039
yes did you get my replies

15
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
oh yeah here we go

16
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,880
so if you're if you're if you're in

17
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,919
if you're physically in the meeting the

18
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,320
breakout rooms is going to be disrupted

19
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,640
if you're not participating

20
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,799
so i'm

21
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,760
um i've set up

22
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,039
a way of recording that we didn't have

23
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,000
last time

24
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,080
uh that doesn't use

25
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
teams to do the recording because teams

26
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,760
doesn't capture the mural right so it

27
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,880
captures the right thing

28
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,200
so in in um i give you a link yeah to uh

29
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
a way you can

30
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
view

31
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,159
without participating

32
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,480
oh we're bringing it okay okay yeah

33
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,480
perfect yeah it's so it's a it's uh

34
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
that'll be

35
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,880
probably the easiest way to do the

36
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,400
recording as well although i'll probably

37
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
create a local recording too

38
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,640
[Music]

39
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
thank you perfect there's a little bit

40
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,480
of a delay

41
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
i think it's about 10 or 15 seconds

42
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,679
between

43
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,520
uh real time and that but i'll let

44
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,840
everybody know that it's being recorded

45
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,840
and all that kind of molarity

46
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,840
okay

47
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,080
magic you're okay with me recording it

48
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,080

51
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,679

stanley as well

56
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,520
maybe

57
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,520
hi ah hey stanley

58
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,600
i am

59
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,039
hoping we'll have quite a few people for

60
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,400
this but you guys are the first ones

61
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,320
here um hi david how you doing

62
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,600
um

63
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,120
just to let you know we are

64
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,960
going to record this session so that

65
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,960
you can see it afterwards okay

66
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
so if anybody uh

67
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,760
has

68
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,520
has has a problem

69
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,080
let me know

70
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,799
but i

71
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,600
can't record so the reason teams

72
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:47,120
doesn't have a little record icon

73
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,000
on it is because it is impossible to

74
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,080
record with mural uh the way the way i

75
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
facilitate these things using teams so i

76
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,919
have a different method

77
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,080
that takes a feed

78
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,200
from teams a feed from uh mural

79
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,559
it combines them and creates a a special

80
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,960
recording

81
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,600
for us so it will only show it won't

82
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,720
show everybody it will only show the the

83
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,520
active speaker and myself as well as the

84
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,520
the mural um so that's all it's going to

85
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,840
show on the recording

86
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,320
does that make

87
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,720
sense i'm just going to um

88
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,679
manage it still here what i am going to

89
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,840

137
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,679
thing that people do yeah

195
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,120
so maybe we have some assumptions we

196
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,960
probably know a lot of stuff already

197
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,640
because people have told us so

198
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
um

199
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,600
hopefully oh i need to click the open

200
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,519
button don't i that would probably help

201
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,399
so i've opened the breakout rooms

202
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,720
um and in your your groups just chat

203
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,000
about what you think

204
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,000
these statements are true or false

205
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,679
let me make that

206
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,880
oh well that's not the right button how

207
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,240
do i do a full screen in

208
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,559
teams now

209
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,840
in a

210
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,840
oh that's why function 11 there we go

211
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,120
manjit if you can uh hear me there are

212
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,440
uh six people

213
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,720
here um

214
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,840
i guess we were hoping for uh more

215
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,840
but just let me know

216
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,679
i'm doing a an exercise with them just

217
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
now so that they can um

218
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,159
just get it a little bit start and think

219
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,399
about some of these questions i might

220
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,360
have to pop in and help them but

221
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,360
um we'll see

222
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,880
is everybody here or are people another

223
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,679
in the other room

224
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,679
let me check yeah

225
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,440
nobody in the other room

226
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,320
okay so we have we have six people just

227
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
now

228
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,720
are you are you expecting more

229
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,280
well i think well yeah last time we had

230
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,679
uh we had this same people when my kid

231
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,000
then attended the introduction to asia

232
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,000
yeah

233
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,599
i don't know what's going

234
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,599
on so i was unable to send my invite to

235
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,720
the gis group

236
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,800
the the

237
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,480
the the

238
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,520
the group email

239
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,159
oh okay so perhaps

240
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,720
i could only invite the people that were

241
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
exactly on the list so you might need to

242
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,879
to send out

243
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,240
that update if you copy the contents of

244
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,399
my

245
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,159
meeting

246
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,159
that's fine okay cool yeah yeah

247
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,520
let's have a look at what they're doing

248
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,079
well simone is there so is someone is

249
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,960
here

250
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,960
yeah

251
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,440
we have um

252
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:21,599
david bauer simona jose sunny stanley

253
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,200
and other davido david or maddie if

254
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,680
someone is there then she would have

255
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,680
received it

256
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,880
maybe there's another meeting going on

257
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,880
that's running over

258
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,200
[Music]

259
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,079
that's why i do this past beginning just

260
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,599
to get people people started

261
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,359
i i

262
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,040
i'm gonna go changing

263
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,800
okay i'm gonna go check on one of the

264
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,119
groups

265
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,119
okay

266
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,160
group two

267
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,480
not struggling but

268
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,480
you know

269
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,079
how to attend or or can

270
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,839
cancel still operate effectively but

271
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
that can be better

272
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,800
the upgrades are flexible for that

273
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,960
particular meeting now we know what to

274
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,960
do

275
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,160
right so yeah

276
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,240
but

277
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,560
initially we were a bit confused as to

278
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,560
why we're in this school

279
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,200
um developers

280
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,320
um commit to deliver the sprint backlog

281
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,040
at

282
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,000
the sprint planned event

283
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,920
yeah yeah i think um is that that's a

284
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,839
good team i mean but yeah i guess you do

285
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,839
yeah yeah yeah

286
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,599
and then at the davis scrum

287
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,880
the developers must

288
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,320
say what

289
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
did they do yesterday what are they

290
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,839
doing today and what what yeah and

291
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,200
what's blocking them that's those are

292
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,200
three questions to be asked for every

293
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,200
scrum

294
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,880
yeah quite strange why

295
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,880
we only got six people

296
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,839
that's okay i can work with six yeah

297
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,839
yeah

298
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,160
might make things less of a ruckus

299
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,880
uh looks like they've all answered the

300
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
questions so i'm going to close the room

301
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,520
and bring them back

302
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,359
three people from my team are i think

303
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,200
we're running the previous meeting so

304
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,200
they'll probably join soon

305
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,200
okay

306
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,839
welcome

307
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,480
jose sonny i can see you guys

308
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,480
how did you get on

309
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,480
uh yeah fine um generally we had

310
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,040
consensus um

311
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,119
this the values there

312
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,720
uh there is not consensus currently

313
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,119
between the two teams which is

314
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,400
interesting the two groups

315
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,560
so uh on number six the scrum master

316
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,760
does not have to attend the daily scrum

317
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,680
group one said uh uh well yes they do

318
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,400
have to attend and group two said no

319
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,359
it's okay if they don't attend and then

320
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,720
for

321
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,000
you must

322
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,920
finish

323
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,839
all of the things in your sprint backlog

324
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,640
by the end of the sprint group one said

325
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,079
yes

326
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240
you must

327
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,240
and group two said it's okay if you

328
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
don't

329
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,440
why why why why a discrepancy

330
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,720
well we were coming from the basis that

331
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,119
if the scrum master has set up

332
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,079
objectives and these you know completely

333
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,480
defined targets and so on he doesn't

334
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,800
necessarily need to be there if the team

335
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,720
is in power to deliver i i i'm hoping

336
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,400
we're going to be answering the question

337
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,839
for you sonny on why the scrum master

338
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,720
should be doing none of those things

339
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,240
okay

340
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
definitely doing none of those things

341
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,920
but

342
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,000
let's uh

343
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,240
reveal

344
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,040
what the correct answers are

345
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,040
over here on the right

346
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,449
[Music]

347
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,640
so i'm just going to zoom in i'll summon

348
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
everybody so we're all looking at the

349
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,119
same thing

350
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,119
you'll probably remember what you put

351
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,800
scrum teams must not be bigger than 10

352
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,720
people

353
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
it's okay if you've ever taken a 12.

354
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,440
that could work it might be more

355
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,200
difficult jose for sure

356
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,520
right it might be more difficult but

357
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,720
it's okay there's nothing in the the in

358
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,800
scrum that says you can't do that

359
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,680
isn't there like an upper limit or is

360
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,280
that just sort of it's it's like a it's

361
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,440
not hard

362
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,119
i think the exact phrase the using the

363
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,720
scrum guide is

364
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,720
typically not more than 10

365
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,560
right right but if you have more than 10

366
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,319
and it works for you

367
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,200
who is scrum to say that that's not okay

368
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,720
right but you are right typically the

369
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,319
more people you have on the team the

370
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,400
more complex

371
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,760
things are but if you guys can handle it

372
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,440
you guys can handle it that's okay are

373
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,319
you doing well you deliver software are

374
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
you

375
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,359
finishing stuff

376
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,359
uh what was question two the scrum

377
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,319
master is there to make sure that the

378
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,280
developers take enough work and get it

379
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,880
done

380
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,319
no they're not there for that

381
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,880
they're there to help the team be more

382
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,880
effective

383
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,079
number three at the daily scrum the

384
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,240
developers must say what did they do

385
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,480
yesterday what am i doing today

386
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,680
and what's blocking them

387
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,960
i think the key word there is must

388
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,160
right i know that many teams do use

389
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,160
those three questions

390
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,760
but what what's the purpose of the daily

391
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,400
scrum jose

392
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,400
why are we there

393
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,560
well

394
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,440
my my thought is it's a sort of

395
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,960
coordination quick coordination type

396
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,640
meeting so that

397
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,920
everyone's aware

398
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,520
you know what's going on and um

399
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,599
i guess the scrum master can deal with

400
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,760
any blockers that have come up

401
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,079
okay

402
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,079
so

403
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,240
let's see

404
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,280
well uh if you take into account the

405
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,280
answer to number six

406
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,680
the scrum master does not even have even

407
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,760
uh have to attend the daily scrum being

408
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,839
correct the scrum master may not be

409
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,359
there

410
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,800
then they'll have to sort out amongst

411
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,880
themselves they'll have to sort it out

412
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,839
amongst themselves what's what's the

413
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,839
purpose of our sprint

414
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,040
what are we trying to do what we why we

415
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,319
there why is somebody paying us money to

416
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,000
sprint

417
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,599
because they want something at the end

418
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,319
don't they

419
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,319
they want some value

420
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,839
is there is there value for your

421
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:54,480
stakeholders

422
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:54,480
in what tasks we're working on just now

423
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,400
well in the sense that they contribute

424
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,760
to the

425
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,839
yes i

426
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,800
i i i agree

427
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,040
um

428
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,040
do

429
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,040
if we thought at the beginning of us i'm

430
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,520
not particularly picking on you i'm just

431
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,599
uh this is this is this is good this is

432
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,800
good um

433
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,280
what

434
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,520
what um

435
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,079
if at the beginning of the sprint

436
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,480
we thought it would take five tasks to

437
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,480
complete something

438
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,560
does that mean it will take five tasks

439
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,560
to complete something

440
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,599
maybe not right

441
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,520
so

442
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,720
the if the focus is on

443
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,960
me

444
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,720
i'm an individual team member

445
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:52,640
what have i done yesterday what am i

446
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,520
doing tomorrow and what's blocking me

447
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,680
where's

448
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,280
the team

449
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
what's the team trying to achieve the

450
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,160
team's trying to achieve completing

451
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,440
value

452
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,960
to deliver to the stakeholders at the

453
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,119
end of the sprint

454
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,119
so instead of looking at those three

455
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,400
questions right which are actually no

456
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,119
longer in the scrum guide they

457
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,960
definitely used to be right as a here's

458
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,280
one way to do that

459
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,599
but i i think it's good to focus on the

460
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,839
value here's the things that we're

461
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,359
trying to deliver for the stakeholders

462
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,680
where are they are they on track are

463
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,680
they not on track um and focusing on

464
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,200
that value can really help bring the

465
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,680
team together

466
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:31,200
to to focus on that so that's that

467
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,720
that's that's a good one for that josie

468
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,560
that was that was uh uh uh some good uh

469
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,720
interactions there

470
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,480
number four was um at sprint review the

471
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,480
developers present their work to the

472
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,160
product owner i think everybody had a

473
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,240
tick for that one didn't they

474
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,760
yeah

475
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,079
no

476
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,480
the product owners presenting their work

477
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,480
to the stakeholders

478
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,000
the product owner should already have

479
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,160
been involved with the developers

480
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,160
understand what's going on

481
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,440
know what they've built

482
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,280
you know

483
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,800
something that i've seen quite a lot in

484
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,119
sprint reviews

485
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,119
and that always

486
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,839
it kind of upsets me a little bit it

487
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,920
makes me feel sad for the team

488
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,520
and that's when the stakeholders turn to

489
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
the product owner and say why did you

490
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,760
build it that way

491
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,920
and then the product owner instead of

492
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,880
standing in front of their team and

493
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,640
defending the decision that was made in

494
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,240
the circumstances that we had turns to

495
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,400
the team and says yeah why did you build

496
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,839
it that way

497
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,839
how's that for passing the buck

498
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,920
who's accountable for value delivery in

499
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,920
scrum

500
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,920
product owner

501
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,640
they should they should be standing out

502
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,800
in front saying this is what i built for

503
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,160
you this sprint this is what my team

504
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,480
created

505
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,400
for you

506
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
yeah so it is

507
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,160
it's subtle right

508
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,680
from uh from a mechanical standpoint

509
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,200
it's subtle

510
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,960
but it creates a massive difference in

511
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,560
the way people feel

512
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,800
in the way people engage with the

513
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,359
process

514
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,079
uh and then we've got number five the

515
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,839
age old you must finish everything in

516
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,040
your sprint and there was definitely

517
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,800
mixed

518
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,839
answers there you don't have to finish

519
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,319
everything that you bring into your

520
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,319
sprint that would be ridiculous

521
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,160
right and i'll tell you why it's

522
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,560
ridiculous who's heard of the iron

523
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,440
triangle

524
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,050
i have iron triangle

525
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,480
so it's a traditional project management

526
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,680
[Music]

527
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,520
conundrum

528
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,040
right we have a triangle going to bring

529
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,839
a little triangle in here at the bottom

530
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,839
there

531
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,400
what are the

532
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,480
the vectors that we have on our triangle

533
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,960
in project management

534
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,839
we have um

535
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,480
time don't

536
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,920
we we get time

537
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,960
and then we've got

538
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,040
um

539
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,720
well sometimes it's it's it's often

540
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,599
called

541
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,119
resources but really it's money

542
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,800
right because people people are your

543
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,960
biggest cost when you're when you're

544
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,480
building stuff generally right i know if

545
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,240
you're oh

546
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,240
if you if you're deploying sap that

547
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,319
might not necessarily be true because

548
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,640
that thing's expensive oh i can't i

549
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,720
can't move them around never mind

550
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,640
uh murals being a bit of a poop at the

551
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,119
moment what's the what's the last one

552
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,800
we've got time resources are people

553
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,920
thank you for that i was trying it yeah

554
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,000
trying to move it over a bit so it's

555
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,240
inside the box but that it's okay

556
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,680
um

557
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,040
i need to refresh my role in order for

558
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,960
it to work for me

559
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,800
it's built in javascript

560
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,559
always causes problems

561
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,720
to get time resources what else do we

562
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,720
have

563
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,400
requirements

564
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,359
yeah what do we generally cut in the

565
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,760
project management world

566
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,760
scope

567
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,559
right

568
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,119
so

569
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,760
what what happens

570
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,079
if you have fixed time fixed resources

571
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,079
fixed scope

572
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,760
what's your experience what happened

573
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,880
sonny

574
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,119
fix time fix resources fixed scope

575
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,200
um

576
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,680
well it depends i mean if the scope is

577
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,319
fixed i'm likely to be able to deliver

578
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,520
that project if they escape free i you

579
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,599
know

580
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,119
i'm moving away from what we

581
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,359
originally agreed and then that's going

582
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,480
to impact my delivery together

583
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,960
if you if you have

584
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,400
complex cognitive work right if you

585
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,880
remember from the last session we talked

586
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,280
about this this building stuff that

587
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,520
doesn't exist yet is complex cognitive

588
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,520
work

589
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,079
what could we cut

590
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,440
in order to deliver on time on budget on

591
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,119
resources

592
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,319
if those things are fixed there's

593
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,440
something else there's actually another

594
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:06,640
metric that we can we can change

595
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,960
as a team

596
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,800
in order to deliver on time on budget on

597
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,160
scope

598
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,240
even if those

599
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,319
that scope is ridiculous even that if

600
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,440
that time is ridiculous even if the

601
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,440
money's next to nothing

602
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,559
sorry i couldn't hear that

603
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,480
i think somebody's mic's not working

604
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,920
very well it's very quiet i don't know

605
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,520
if ever anybody else caught that it

606
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,640
could be my ears

607
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,880
but it's a bit in the middle

608
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,880
is quality

609
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,800
right that's largely hidden

610
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,359
in complex cognitive work till you find

611
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,559
out at the end it's a big steaming pile

612
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,359
of

613
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,800
poop

614
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,240
right that's delivered to the customer

615
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,160
and the customer is like why is this

616
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,680
broken and this doesn't work and when i

617
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,440
click here i get this error and what's

618
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,240
going on why is this not working

619
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,559
right that's your quality

620
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,240
if you put people doing complex

621
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,920
cognitive tasks

622
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,400
under pressure

623
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,079
to deliver scope within a fixed time

624
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,119
fixed resources

625
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,880
they will continuously and increasingly

626
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,280
cut quality

627
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,760
to meet whatever ridiculous time frame

628
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,760
you give them

629
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,319
right have you ever there's a there's a

630
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,640
youtube video

631
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,640
of an artist drawing spider-man

632
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,319
right and it's just a hand pencil

633
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,760
drawing spider-man i i don't have the

634
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,559
youtube video or otherwise i'd play it

635
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,800
for you but it it's awesome if i if i if

636
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,200
you if you had this expert artist that

637
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,200
draws spider-man all the time

638
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,640
and it takes them usually about 10

639
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,200
minutes they can draw a pretty good

640
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,440
spider-man

641
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,480
right if you give them 10 minutes

642
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,040
you're going to get a pretty

643
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,559
nice-looking spider-man aren't you

644
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,559
what happens if you give them one minute

645
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,960
what's going to happen to the quality of

646
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,400
the product the scope is the same

647
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,000
the resources are the same

648
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,160
but we've reduced the time and it's

649
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,400
still fixed

650
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,359
so what can that person change in order

651
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,640
to deliver inside of that minute

652
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,400
quality

653
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,960
you can have a you're you're going to

654
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,880
have a lesser spiderman a lesser

655
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,400
delivery

656
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,040
what what would happen if you gave him

657
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
10 seconds

658
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,960
you're gonna have a little stick figure

659
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,280
spiderman you

660
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,040
right and that that's actually the the

661
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,359
the example they give in the youtube

662
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,160
video is those three scenarios drawing

663
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,559
spider-man 10 minutes one minute one

664
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,800
minute spider-man was

665
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,800
it still looked like spider-man

666
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,280
10 seconds spider-man 10 seconds

667
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,760
spider-man sucks

668
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,040
right and that's the software we're

669
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
often delivering the 10 second

670
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,599
spider-man

671
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,040
so in in scrum

672
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,000
right if i grab a little line

673
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,960
we've got a fixed time because we have

674
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,040
an agreed sprint length

675
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:16,160
right

676
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,160
in scrum we've got a fixed resources

677
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,839
because

678
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,119
we have an agreed team

679
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,640
right maybe

680
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,160
this sprint that you've got a team of

681
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,599
five next sprint you've got a team of

682
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,520
six the sprint after that you've got a

683
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,280
team of five right that could be the

684
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,880
changes between sprints but generally

685
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,119
you want to keep it stable at least

686
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,720
inside of a sprint

687
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,839
right you might have to call on external

688
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,839
experts and that can anything but you

689
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,200
want to keep it reasonably stable

690
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,440
and

691
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,319
so then then our only options for what

692
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,720
we can flex to deliver on time

693
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:49,680
is scope or quality which one do you

694
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,680
want to compromise on

695
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,960
which one do you believe

696
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,359
your cfo

697
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,839
who's looking at the capital expenditure

698
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,359
investment in

699
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,960
software would expect you to compromise

700
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,640
on

701
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,960
is your cfo going to be happy with

702
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,760
shitty quality

703
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,720
no

704
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,000
so

705
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,880
you're not going to be able to sell your

706
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,520
ceo on can we have a hundred grand and

707
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,040
deliver you 10 grand worth of software

708
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,280
right he's not you're not going to be

709
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,640
able to sell him on that so in in the

710
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,440
scrum world

711
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,200
we fix quality

712
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,400
right let me know how we do that in the

713
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,720
scrum team

714
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,319
with the scrum team there's a particular

715
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,319
thing in scrum that we use for that

716
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,319
is that the definition of done it is

717
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:41,200
absolutely the definition of done

718
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,760
right that's our sacrosanct commitment

719
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,400
from the team to deliver a minimum level

720
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,400
of quality

721
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,839
okay

722
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,680
and the level of quality since the team

723
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,119
to deliver on it they have to agree with

724
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,599
it

725
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,280
right but you might have organizational

726
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,440
standards as well like what's the main

727
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,880
level of quality your cfo expects your

728
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,520
products to have

729
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,599
in order because remember

730
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,000
your cfo's gonna put those products on a

731
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,839
balance sheet somewhere

732
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,720
right capital expenditure gets written

733
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:15,040
down he's telling the tax man

734
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,599
i spent 100 grand i got 100 grand worth

735
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,280
of stuff and it burns down at this rate

736
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,000
each year

737
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,359
what else if you like the pax man

738
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,800
regardless of whether you know you're

739
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,200
lying or not

740
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,800
does the tax man care whether you know

741
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,559
no he does not

742
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,520
he does not care

743
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,920
he would call that fraud and you'd be

744
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,200
not in a good place

745
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,520
okay so quality is really important like

746
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,960
it is one of the most important aspects

747
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,760
of this

748
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,319
so the thing that we can flex

749
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,319
actually the least important

750
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,640
piece of what we deliver

751
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,960
is often the scope and i'll hopefully

752
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,839
explain why it's the scope we go

753
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,880
right

754
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:01,119
um we want to achieve goals

755
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,799
not number of items

756
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,880
if we achieve the goal for the

757
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,480
stakeholders and the stakeholders are

758
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,119
happy does it doesn't matter whether we

759
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,880
delivered five things or ten things

760
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,799
if we achieved what they wanted no it

761
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,240
doesn't they don't care they don't care

762
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,839
whether they do five things or tactics

763
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,760
or hopefully they don't we need to train

764
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,760
them too

765
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,240
did that make sense for that iron angle

766
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,240
reference that i had

767
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,440
yeah

768
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,520
ah

769
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,400
we covered the scrum master not ending

770
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:34,880
doesn't have to attend

771
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:36,160
right what what happens um

772
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,799
oh yeah

773
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,960
developers commit to deliver the sprint

774
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,319
backlog at the sprint planning event i

775
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,720
think everybody had a tick in that one

776
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,720
didn't they

777
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:53,280
didn't we just fix scope again

778
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,319
we did we just fixed scope again

779
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,720
right

780
00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:00,880
it's it's very easy for us to trick

781
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:02,880
ourselves back into fixing scope

782
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,359
you're always going to lose with fixed

783
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:07,119
scope you have to have variable scope

784
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,599
because we've got fixed time we've got

785
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,160
fixed resources we want to fix quality

786
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,160
so the only thing we can vary is scope

787
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,319
so that that i

788
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,559
there's nothing wrong with your answers

789
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,520
the reason i ask these questions at the

790
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,599
start

791
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,680
is they are super common

792
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,559
that this is how they get answered

793
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,400
yeah

794
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,559
that's why i'm asking them specifically

795
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,200
because they are they are

796
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,880
pretty common for that

797
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:39,359
so we have there are six of us

798
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,680
seven with manjeet if i can

799
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,880
con him into participating

800
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,520
um

801
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:51,760
so that makes eight with me so i think

802
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,760
i think i'd like to find out

803
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,440
what you already know

804
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,680
about what's required for scrum what do

805
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,400
we have to have

806
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,400
in order to be doing scrum

807
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,559
so there are some things that are are

808
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,040
maybe how did any of you read the scrum

809
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,839
guide i've read the scrum guide i think

810
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,119
manjit has

811
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:18,480
okay no so okay so we're going from

812
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,920
what have we seen teams do

813
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,480
what have we heard

814
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,440
them talk out

815
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,200
okay

816
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,200
does that make sense we've not read the

817
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,640
rule book we're trying to play the we're

818
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,079
trying to play the game

819
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,880
so we can only go by what people are

820
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,079
telling us they're doing

821
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,920
okay

822
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,280
um so what i'd like you to do we're

823
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,000
going to do something called a it's

824
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,280
called a one two four all exercise i

825
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,119
think we did one last time if you were

826
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,079
here at last time

827
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,200
so i'm going to create um

828
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,799
three

829
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,240
wait a minute there's eight of us

830
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,280
because i'm gonna call manjit into this

831
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,119
one

832
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,520
um there's eight of us

833
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,520
so i'm going to create four rooms

834
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,319
and

835
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,319
we're gonna

836
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,720
i'd like you to

837
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,200
we're gonna first do one minute

838
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,240
on your own creating a list of things

839
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,680
that you think are required for scrum

840
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,680
right and that required word is

841
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,079
important what is required

842
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,480
and then we're going to go into breakout

843
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,319
rooms with pairs

844
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,920
okay and we're going to merge our two

845
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,200
lists

846
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,720
we're going to merge them together so we

847
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,160
end up with one list and we'll have two

848
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,599
minutes for that

849
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,440
and then i'm going to merge two of the

850
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,599
breakout rooms so there'll be four of us

851
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,520
in a room okay that's five fingers four

852
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,440
of us in a room

853
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,200
right but two lists

854
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,640
because we already merged them and we're

855
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,319
gonna merge them together again so when

856
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,760
we come back at the end we'll have two

857
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,599
lists here

858
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,160
that we can then merge together does

859
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,240
that make sense

860
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,880
cool so i'm going to put a timer on for

861
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:57,440
one minute

862
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,079
for you to silently and you're on your

863
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,240
own uh create that list and whoever ends

864
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:05,680
up with me it will be lucky because my

865
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,760
list will probably be fairly

866
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,440
well i hope my list is fairly fairly

867
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,680
fairly good

868
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,680
um

869
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,559
sorry maxine can you repeat um

870
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,599
what was required for

871
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,040
just the

872
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,839
yeah so i'd like you to create a list of

873
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,520
uh

874
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,920
things that you know of that are

875
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,880
required for scrum that are needed for

876
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,880
us to be doing scrum

877
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,799
um

878
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,440
how much time have i got left

879
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,280
well time box expired i only got one two

880
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,280
three four five i only got six things on

881
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,040
my list but that's my typing capability

882
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,559
rather than anything else

883
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,920
i'm going to open the breakout rooms we

884
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,119
go into pairs

885
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,119
and get your items down on the mural

886
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:12,640
right if you did it in notepad like the

887
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,119
explanation then you can just paste it

888
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,359
in that's what i'm going to do um if you

889
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,960
wrote it down you can join them together

890
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,559
in your in your group and you'll have

891
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,640
two minutes in pairs and then i'll merge

892
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:25,280
the rooms together okay

893
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:28,000
david omari i'm sorry you draw the short

894
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,559
straw and you are going to end up in a

895
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,559
room with me

896
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,480
i will make sure that everybody gets

01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,680
at story points story points could you

953
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,559
add story points to the mural while i uh

954
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,359
organize all of the participants into

955
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,640
uh

956
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,799
i'll bring him into one

957
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,799
uh so

958
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,119
four

959
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,720
goes into one

960
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,200
four goes into one

961
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,720
uh

962
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,280
[Music]

963
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,839
three goes into two

964
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,920
three goes into two let's assign that

965
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:43,920
there we go move

966
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,839
and the new person coming in so

967
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,960
hopefully

968
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,960
this will all work out

969
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:57,760
so uh so did you add story points

970
01:03:54,079 --> 01:04:00,160
um yes yes yes i was just moving the

971
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,160
rooms

972
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,839
four

973
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,839
yeah

974
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,520
all the way

975
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,480
definitely dip those things that's a

976
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,839
good idea

977
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,839
yeah otherwise

978
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,559
uh i see you've got story points there

979
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,839
i'm gonna bring i'll bring that one down

980
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,200
here

981
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,520
there we go

982
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,680
so we've kind of got people

983
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,359
artifacts and then some events are we

984
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,720
missing some events we've got

985
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:17,920
retrospective sprint panning daily scrum

986
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,920
would you find matches missing

987
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,319
and sprint review

988
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,640
two things we need is a

989
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:38,720
definition of readiness definition ready

990
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,720
for a story and in a dod

991
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,280
you can make

992
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,280
martian happy

993
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,839
yep i can't spell that definition i've

994
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,599
never been able to spell that word

995
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,480
but i did put them on there

996
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:54,160
it's just it's it's a dyslexic thing i i

997
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,599
spell it the way it sounds and that

998
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,920
doesn't work for the spell checker yeah

999
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,920
yeah yeah

1000
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,079
anything else and where

1001
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,400
what about like the stakeholders

1002
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,400
shouldn't they be oh that's a good idea

1003
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,319
yeah

1004
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,119
stakeholders is a good idea would be

1005
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,119
useful yeah

1006
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,960
um

1007
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,559
a release plan

1008
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,319
what else

1009
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,280
what else do we need

1010
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,359
what do you hear your team's talking

1011
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,359
about you need

1012
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,720
gold spring gold

1013
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:19,000
just under all just over a minute left

1014
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,000
what else do we need

1015
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:34,640
maybe that's it maybe that's it yeah

1016
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,160
future timeline no that's not really

1017
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,160
that's the kind of bike product isn't it

1018
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,839
there are definitely certain things in

1019
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,839
scrum that are implicit in other things

1020
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,640
so they're not mentioned

1021
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:52,079
right

1022
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,760
so things like a a a a release plan

1023
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,280
right that might be implicit in

1024
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,280
something else but it's okay to have it

1025
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,280
on the list because then we can figure

1026
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,440
out what it's implicit in

1027
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,119
right it's a thing we have

1028
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,960
so we get story points user stories

1029
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,960
definition of ready definition of done

1030
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,559
beam velocity

1031
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,559
oh team velocity

1032
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,920
burn down

1033
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,920
oh yep burn down

1034
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,839
it's a good one

1035
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,440
oh well i'm going to close the room

1036
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,440
slide

1037
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,880
where is this a spring celebration

1038
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:45,359
i put a magic funded party on there

1039
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,839
yeah yeah yeah

1040
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,839
at the end of the sprint

1041
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:13,040
i think my teams is working now it's

1042
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,679
been a bit slow

1043
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,120
being a bit slow

1044
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,199
okay we've got quite a lot of things on

1045
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,640
these

1046
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:23,839
two lists

1047
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:28,159
um so let's bring across

1048
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:30,319
what the other uh group had

1049
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,839
um

1050
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,799
did maggie make it in or did she

1051
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,719
disappear i think maggie disappeared

1052
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:40,880
he said he has already attended one of

1053
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:43,279
yours before okay uh sunny graham and

1054
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,799
david just looking at your list you get

1055
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,920
team members

1056
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:48,640
um

1057
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,839
which we don't have product owner uh we

1058
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,759
have that on our list developer

1059
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:56,000
is it developer or developers is that

1060
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,360
the same thing

1061
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,760
i think it's the same thing isn't it

1062
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,040
same thing yeah scrum master we have

1063
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,960
that over there

1064
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,360
uh backlog

1065
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,800
objectives i like objectives let's bring

1066
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,760
that one over

1067
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,760
uh

1068
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,800
collaboration with the product owner

1069
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:17,120
that is definitely an activity we need

1070
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:19,040
uh stories in a definition of done uh

1071
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,960
can we separate that out into two things

1072
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,800
we have user stories

1073
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,760
here and definition of done down here is

1074
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:28,640
that okay does that cover both of those

1075
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,360
yeah yep cool so we got team members

1076
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,600
sprint length back clock

1077
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,920
this is a pretty good list i think

1078
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,199
oh let me see if i can make them all the

1079
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,880
same

1080
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,880
size which is this button

1081
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,560
there we go now everything's the same

1082
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,560
size

1083
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,679
i think we're missing some things

1084
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,840
i they're missing some interesting

1085
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,159
things

1086
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,679
do you remember

1087
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,360
on monday

1088
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,679
when we talked about

1089
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,880
agility

1090
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,239
we did an

1091
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,080
exercise

1092
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,800
with the the

1093
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,640
agile manifesto

1094
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,520
where we came up with a list of items

1095
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,640
that

1096
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,480
were valid for great teams

1097
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,719
and they all ended up on the left hand

1098
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,040
side didn't they

1099
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,960
people and interactions the only people

1100
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,560
in interactions here we've got is this

1101
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,560
one collaboration with the product

1102
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,560
owners

1103
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,040
all all of this other stuff seems to be

1104
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,880
about

1105
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,270
rigidity and how we do things that's

1106
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,560
processes and tools isn't it

1107
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:44,159
[Music]

1108
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,239
so so we're missing a lot of that other

1109
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:49,040
stuff

1110
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,040
where does it come in

1111
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,440
there was a responsibility

1112
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,120
probably i would say well we have we

1113
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,880
have the roles but the roles in their

1114
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,360
accountability

1115
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,400
that's that's that's procedure

1116
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,840
right that's uh that's a a practice we

1117
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,880
should have a product owner because the

1118
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,040
scrum guy tells us to

1119
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,800
right isn't that processes and tools

1120
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,960
that's that side isn't it but

1121
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,560
to make a great team

1122
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,360
you want

1123
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,840
the roles that you need

1124
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:23,199
i don't think that the roles are i have

1125
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,880
worked on many great teams

1126
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,199
that don't have anybody called a product

1127
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,199
owner

1128
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,000
maybe don't have anybody

1129
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,000
called a scrum master

1130
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:40,719
does that does a does a soccer team need

1131
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,320
a scrum master or a product toner

1132
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,719
yeah they're the captain

1133
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:48,239
are they on the field with them

1134
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,239
captain is here the captain is

1135
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,880
so we are missing something and what

1136
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,880
we're missing

1137
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,280
is

1138
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,280
a value system

1139
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,960
we're missing values we want to

1140
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,159
help

1141
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,560
shape

1142
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:12,719
people and behaviors

1143
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,679
we want positive outcomes for people and

1144
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:21,840
behaviors we want to get transparency

1145
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:25,840
right and transparency is hard

1146
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:28,880
sunny if i asked you to provide data on

1147
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,199
how many hours per day you worked but

1148
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,800
every day you showed me the number of

1149
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:36,560
hours and i wasn't happy with you

1150
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,960
because the numbers didn't look like i

1151
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:42,159
wanted them to look

1152
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:46,320
and i was your your your direct report

1153
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:50,080
what sorry the other way around

1154
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:52,560
what what would your behavior

1155
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,000
result in what might that metric that

1156
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,800
measure

1157
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,719
you're always i'm american i think you

1158
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,320
must do 40 hours a week you're telling

1159
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,199
me you're doing 37 and a half hours a

1160
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,199
week i'm not happy

1161
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,400
what are you going to tell me

1162
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,159
i would skew the data you would skew the

1163
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,320
data yeah

1164
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,040
yeah

1165
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,360
so funnily enough i i used to work at a

1166
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,960
little company called merrill lynch

1167
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,239
and at merrill lynch being an american

1168
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,239
company in order to get paid

1169
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:26,320
every employee must

1170
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,760
enter 40 hours a week into timesheet

1171
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,000
system

1172
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,800
it didn't matter that nobody in europe

1173
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,199
worked 40 hours a week we had to find a

1174
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,080
project in order to allocate the extra

1175
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,080
two and a half hours

1176
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,840
because we did 37.5 hours

1177
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,600
they didn't care the systems were just

1178
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,080
doing it that way that's the way we do

1179
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,080
things here

1180
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,679
so if you measure people

1181
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,360
in a way

1182
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:02,800
that makes it difficult for them to

1183
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,360
achieve

1184
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,520
or hard or impossible

1185
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,800
they'll fuse the data

1186
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,840
do you think that happens on the big

1187
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,840
scale as well sonny

1188
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:18,640
i would have thought so

1189
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:20,640
our recent one is volkswagen

1190
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,239
volkswagen was caught faking the

1191
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,679
emissions data

1192
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:27,920
why because it was impossible

1193
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:31,199
for diesel cars to meet the emission

1194
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,199
standards that were put on them

1195
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,040
it was not possible to sell a product

1196
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:38,280
that met the emission standard so they

1197
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,280
faked the data

1198
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,040
right it's just how humans work

1199
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,880
so we need to figure out a way how do we

1200
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,159
create a system

1201
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,080
within which people want to do the right

1202
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:56,000
thing they want to be transparent they

1203
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:58,080
don't feel like they're going to be

1204
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,360
victimized is probably too strong a word

1205
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,640
right but um blamed

1206
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,480
for

1207
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,280
data not looking good data is about the

1208
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,360
real world

1209
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,440
so one of those ways is we have

1210
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:14,080
something in scrum called the the scrum

1211
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,080
values

1212
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,400
okay

1213
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,440
and the scrum values are courage

1214
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,800
focus

1215
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,640
respect

1216
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,640
openness and commitment

1217
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,800
but each of those

1218
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:32,800
can't exist in isolation

1219
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,880
if you have courage

1220
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,600
without respect

1221
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,760
you might call your boss an [Â __Â ]

1222
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,199
and that's not going to be conducive to

1223
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:45,840
having continued employment is it

1224
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,280
right so we need the balance of all of

1225
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,640
these things

1226
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,719
so in this

1227
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,840
exercise going to be interesting because

1228
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,760
i have not run it with only eight people

1229
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,920
before so we'll see

1230
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,040
uh uh how this how this uh how much fun

1231
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,719
we have

1232
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,719
um oh there's a little post-it come in

1233
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,120
ah

1234
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,440
somebody's already started adding

1235
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,400
post-its you guys are keen

1236
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:14,840
okay so in the scrum valve circuit

1237
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:18,960
we're gonna break up into into into

1238
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,400
groups i'm thinking it kind of needs to

1239
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,040
be

1240
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,840
groups of two

1241
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,719
well maybe can we do three

1242
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,719
no

1243
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,800
because that would require nine of us

1244
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,760
so it need to be groups of two

1245
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,239
okay

1246
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:35,840
let me create that so we'll do groups of

1247
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,400
two

1248
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,320
and we're going to do this scrum values

1249
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,320
circuit think of it like a circuit you

1250
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,320
would do at the gym do you go to them

1251
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,320
jose

1252
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,560
no

1253
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,199
now okay so this is this is this is

1254
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,760
circuit training we have we have five

1255
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:58,000
stations here

1256
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,880
okay for the circuit training and we

1257
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,960
have three groups

1258
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,440
okay

1259
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:08,719
what we're going to do

1260
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,719
and i am going to

1261
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:14,800
so five and three

1262
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,800
this is hard let's do

1263
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,000
i'm trying to sorry i'm trying to get my

1264
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,840
brain around the numbers because we need

1265
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,440
to move between the stations

1266
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,440
um

1267
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,760
it would be better if there was six

1268
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,640
values wouldn't it because then numbers

1269
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,239
would add up better for me three

1270
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:36,880
any odd number is just difficult uh so i

1271
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:38,960
think yes we'll do we'll do three groups

1272
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,560
and it will be one

1273
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,840
one three and five that's what i'm gonna

1274
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,120
do one and i'm gonna rename this group

1275
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,320
from two

1276
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,560
to three

1277
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,440
and this one from three to five because

1278
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,960
i think that's gonna work better or it's

1279
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,679
gonna work just as bad as i think it's

1280
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,440
going to work so let's see how that goes

1281
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,920
so what we're going to do is when you

1282
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,520
get into the the exercise

1283
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,600
into the breakout room

1284
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,120
i'd like you to look at the top of your

1285
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,159
breakout room and you'll have a room

1286
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,440
number

1287
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,800
i'm going to tell you what it is just

1288
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:10,640
now but the room number will be at the

1289
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,199
top of your your screen

1290
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,880
so david graham and david

1291
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,880
randomly created

1292
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,640
are going to be in room one that stanley

1293
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,920
and manjeet are going to be in room two

1294
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,040
and jose and sunny are going to be in

1295
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:26,480
room five okay

1296
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:29,280
i want you to go to the station

1297
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,520
that matches your room number

1298
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,120
so jose and sunny are going to go to

1299
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,840
station five

1300
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,640
and they're

1301
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:40,159
um value is openness

1302
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,840
and i'd like you to start adding

1303
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:46,960
post-its around openness

1304
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,719
for what effect what behaviors would you

1305
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,840
see in people

1306
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,840
if you have openness

1307
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,600
right what are the behaviors that you

1308
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
would see in teams with that with that

1309
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,840
value being present

1310
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,239
and then when the time box expires which

1311
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,159
you're going to have

1312
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:06,000
i think because of so few people we do

1313
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,520
three minutes at each one we'll do three

1314
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,400
minutes

1315
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,280
for that at the end of the three minutes

1316
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,080
you

1317
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:16,239
are going to move to the next station

1318
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,679
sunny if you're at station 5 and you

1319
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:20,560
have to go to the next station and this

1320
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:23,840
one where do you go

1321
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,760
station one yes see i can read lips too

1322
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,679
station one

1323
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,679
and station one

1324
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,679
will have already been filled out by the

1325
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,760
people in room one

1326
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,239
and you're going to review

1327
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,679
what they've put and added additional

1328
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,480
things you're going to bring your

1329
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,000
openness context to courage does that

1330
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,639
make sense

1331
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,159
and we'll do at five three minute

1332
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,000
intervals

1333
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:50,639
right it really is like the gym sunny

1334
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,440
with a five three minute intervals um so

1335
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:56,080
you'll have seen all of the stations

1336
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,360
does that make sense

1337
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:01,480
cool

1338
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,480
does anybody not understand

1339
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,440
even better

1340
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,960
okay

1341
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,199
so go to the station that matches your

1342
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,639
room you'll start in one three or five

1343
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,760
it will say your room number at the top

1344
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:18,159
of the screen um and i do i have the

1345
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,520
text here i don't i will send you a

1346
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:23,520
message you know where where you're

1347
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:26,000
going next just in case you forget okay

1348
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,440
just in case so three minutes

1349
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,679
in each station so i'm going to open the

1350
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,000
breakout rooms

1351
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,280
and start at the station that matches

1352
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,520
your

1353
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,520
your

1354
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,239
your room number

1355
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:16,239
sorry for those that are uh watching the

1356
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,639
feet

1357
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,800
um or the recording

1358
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,159
i am just

1359
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,159
setting up i'm

1360
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,520
setting up little messages that i'm

1361
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:27,760
going to send

1362
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,040
uh to the team as they go through the

1363
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,600
the rounds

1364
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:33,360
so that they remember

1365
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,639
what we're doing because sometimes you

1366
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,719
forget

1367
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,520
but we can see

1368
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:40,960
courage not afraid to speak up

1369
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,560
um

1370
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,719
being against the

1371
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,480
conceived wisdom i think is going in

1372
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,480
there that's pretty good

1373
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,480
um

1374
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,480
i'm not sure what's happening at three

1375
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,960
with manjeet

1376
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,600
and stanley

1377
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:03,480
uh but you have a minute left can i just

1378
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,480
message that one room

1379
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,659
[Music]

1380
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:14,000
but in openness we've got being able to

1381
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:17,679
provide so sometimes with this exercise

1382
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,840
um one room maybe the folks aren't sure

1383
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,159
what we mean and they end up spending

1384
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,520
too much time just discussing it as soon

1385
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,040
as they move

1386
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,960
to another room

1387
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:30,800
that already has all states they

1388
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,880
suddenly get it so we'll see if uh um it

1389
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,560
works itself out it should do because

1390
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,400
we've got so few people and we've got

1391
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,760
gaps between the rooms that might be two

1392
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,800
rooms before they figure it out but

1393
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,520
that's okay

1394
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:44,960
again it's three minutes each room uh uh

1395
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,639
three five's 15 minutes total um

1396
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,760
it's it's a good exercise so this is an

1397
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,280
exercise i would do with with teams um i

1398
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,000
would have them

1399
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,800
think about how the values um affect

1400
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,400
their team's behaviors this is the most

1401
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,600
important stuff

1402
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,040
in scrum everything else is the

1403
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,040
mechanics that you can get from the

1404
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,719
scrum guide so reading the scrum guide

1405
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:07,440
you get

1406
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,960
probably 50 of the way there for scrum

1407
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,840
just following the rules of scrum is

1408
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,840
some

1409
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,480
let me

1410
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,040
do

1411
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,040
round two

1412
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,560
announce

1413
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,760
round two

1414
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,239
and

1415
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,159
three minutes people have already moved

1416
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:25,920
stations well let me take that post it

1417
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,320
there out because the arrows getting

1418
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:30,560
hidden there we go i'll take that one

1419
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,560
out

1420
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,760
so if you have more people obviously the

1421
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,960
more people you have the more stuff goes

1422
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,040
on but you can see there's quite a lot

1423
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:42,239
of things in station five

1424
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:44,480
um there's actually uh

1425
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:47,199
quite a lot of things in

1426
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,880
station three now

1427
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:50,880
story refinement

1428
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,480
i'm not sure

1429
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:56,960
that

1430
01:25:52,480 --> 01:26:00,280
that group has a an understanding

1431
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,280
of behaviors

1432
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,800
so let me

1433
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,800
um

1434
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,920
i could jump into that room and just

1435
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,320
help them out for a second

1436
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,719
because they've got to collaborate in

1437
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,719
commit

1438
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:21,000
delivery quality

1439
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,600
hey folks

1440
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,320
think

1441
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:33,360
can you can you think about the

1442
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:35,360
behaviors that you would see in people

1443
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,400
okay

1444
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,840
yeah so

1445
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,840
if people have commitment

1446
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,679
what behaviors would you see in a team

1447
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,679
if a team had commitment

1448
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:50,159
what people behaviors would you have

1449
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,600
stanley

1450
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:52,780
they will collaborate

1451
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,080
so

1452
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,159
[Applause]

1453
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,080
working together

1454
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:00,239
right would be the behavior

1455
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:04,679
rather than working separately

1456
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:04,679
what other behaviors might you have

1457
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,600
um

1458
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,840
could you might you have holding each

1459
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:21,600
other accountable

1460
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,159
yeah

1461
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,080
right if i if i'm on a team with you

1462
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:28,800
and i commit

1463
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,800
to helping you with something

1464
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,560
right you would hold me accountable for

1465
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,960
that wouldn't you

1466
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,480
yes yeah yeah

1467
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,159
that's that's that's the

1468
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,280
types of behaviors that we're looking

1469
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,120
for

1470
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,600
all right okay

1471
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,600
um

1472
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:50,159
i'm gonna let you get on with it okay

1473
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,159
okay yep

1474
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:03,679
i'm back okay uh

1475
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,960
so

1476
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,600
i'm

1477
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,280
not a huge fan of these ones

1478
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,880
uh but it's 10 seconds left let me get

1479
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:13,679
the next message going

1480
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,400
round three

1481
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,760
so

1482
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,360
the folks that were at station one

1483
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,840
who've done courage and respect will end

1484
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:21,280
up in focus and they'll not be sure what

1485
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,679
to do with those

1486
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,400
so let me

1487
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:29,400
iron three there we go db's off there

1488
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,400
already

1489
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,800
i just want to let them know that they

1490
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:39,800
are right so let me pop into their room

1491
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,760
i just wanted to make sure

1492
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,600
that you didn't get caught in the red

1493
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,840
herring and think you were doing

1494
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:00,800
something wrong in the previous two

1495
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,800
windows you weren't

1496
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,679
okay just because

1497
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:09,440
station three has things like

1498
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:12,000
story pointing and sprint goal

1499
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,159
that those one those ones are incorrect

1500
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,560
it's definitely it's behaviors you guys

1501
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,760
are correct okay yes yeah i just wanted

1502
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,120
to make sure you didn't get distracted

1503
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,440
by that

1504
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,400
okay all right please we're trying to

1505
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:27,760
keep our focus party yeah

1506
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,760
i'm distracting you sorry about that

1507
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,280
so the value in um these exercises doing

1508
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,800
them

1509
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:45,600
uh like this

1510
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,920
there's no value in me just telling you

1511
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:50,560
about scrum okay

1512
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,159
you can read that in a book you can read

1513
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,239
that in the scrum guide it takes less

1514
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:55,360
than an hour to read it's super

1515
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:58,239
straightforward you can get it in a

1516
01:29:55,360 --> 01:30:00,080
diagram i do have a diagram uh

1517
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:02,080
nobody's following me cool look i have a

1518
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,840
diagram down here a little scrum diagram

1519
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,639
there it is you know you know scrum

1520
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,760
right

1521
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:10,719
the the difficulty in doing scrum

1522
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,639
is how do we connect people

1523
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:15,520
to the things we're trying to achieve

1524
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,520
and how do we

1525
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,440
get them to work together virtuously

1526
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,600
right we want a positive

1527
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,840
spiral of success

1528
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,520
not a negative spiral failure which a

1529
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,360
lot of teams end up in

1530
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,480
especially if you end up in that fixed

1531
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,400
scope

1532
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:34,320
world you can end up in a negative

1533
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,040
spiral of failure every sprint feels

1534
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:40,920
like a failure to the team

1535
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,920
do your team understand

1536
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:44,880
why they're doing the work how do they

1537
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:47,280
connect the work that they're doing just

1538
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,120
now to the outcomes the customer wants

1539
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,639
or the stakeholders want

1540
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,920
can they make that connection do they

1541
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,040
understand enough to make that

1542
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,920
connection

1543
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,760
because if they don't have that

1544
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,000
connection when

1545
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,400
you're an engineer working on a product

1546
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,480
making changes to stuff or you're you're

1547
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:05,040
writing a story right you're writing an

1548
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,880
essay if you don't understand what the

1549
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,639
outcome's supposed to be

1550
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,840
and the context of that outcome and the

1551
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,840
people that are going to read it who

1552
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,520
your audience is

1553
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,679
you're going to make lots of incorrect

1554
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:17,679
decisions about how you put this thing

1555
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,600
together

1556
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:21,600
so how do we create

1557
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,000
that understanding

1558
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,760
so we've got the the scrum values that

1559
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,840
help build

1560
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:31,840
transparency

1561
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,840
let me do round four

1562
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,880
and

1563
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,800
message there it is broadcast

1564
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,000
there we go

1565
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,600
uh

1566
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,600
where was i

1567
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,520
i don't remember

1568
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,239
uh yeah so you you you have the scrum

1569
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,360
values that build trust trust enables

1570
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,280
you to

1571
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:55,600
inspect and adapt right because you can

1572
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:57,600
now see what's really going on

1573
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,679
and you have people working together for

1574
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,400
their success

1575
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:04,080
right so hopefully we get happier people

1576
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:05,440
if we then have and we're going to talk

1577
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,280
about well

1578
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:08,639
how close are we going to i'll talk

1579
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,679
about it here but we're going to talk

1580
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,360
about goals as well and goals are the

1581
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:15,440
way that we connect people to the work

1582
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,440
goals are the way we have flexible scope

1583
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:20,080
we've got a sprint goal

1584
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,800
to give us flexibility flexibility in

1585
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,560
the sprint backlog and we've got oh and

1586
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,719
we've got

1587
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,440
the products all to help us get product

1588
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,239
flexibility at the product level

1589
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,840
so

1590
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:33,840
um having uh

1591
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,239
having those things is really important

1592
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,679
they are the most critical things in in

1593
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:46,239
scrum

1594
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,639
goal-based the goal-based mechanics the

1595
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:50,800
value-based mechanics that everything

1596
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,239
else is just icing on the cake if you

1597
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,360
had

1598
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,800
the the scrum values and you had product

1599
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,800
goals

1600
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,800
you might find that many teams will be

1601
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,480
successful anyway

1602
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:05,360
okay they might not even you may even

1603
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,880
not need to show them the scrum guide

1604
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,960
they're gonna figure out how to solve

1605
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,000
their problems they're going to have

1606
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,600
focus

1607
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,280
with the goals they're going to have the

1608
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,920
courage to say when something doesn't

1609
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:18,080
work and help each other and say no when

1610
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,520
they're getting too much work

1611
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,960
right and that's going to start reducing

1612
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,480
quality because they're taking on too

1613
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,239
much they're going to respect their

1614
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,159
customer by delivering working software

1615
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:28,960
they're going to respect each other

1616
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:31,600
the leadership but it it's a virtuous

1617
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,400
cycle that's what we want

1618
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:36,480
so there's one more we're in round four

1619
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,320
we are indeed in round four so we have

1620
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:40,239
one more round five

1621
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,590
and then i'll ask them

1622
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,880
um

1623
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:44,719
[Music]

1624
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,360
i guess what

1625
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,199
there's no right answers in here right

1626
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,000
so it's an experience that you have to

1627
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:54,159
go through at creating these items and

1628
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,400
it's

1629
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:57,920
what did you realize

1630
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,120
going through this exercise what were

1631
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,639
the things

1632
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,400
uh um

1633
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:03,840
that stood out for you

1634
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,000
but i definitely need to add goals to

1635
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,520
this uh this workshop we only have like

1636
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,199
minutes left so

1637
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:12,639
um

1638
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,639
getting enough stuff

1639
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:19,600
so we took 30 minutes on that

1640
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:21,600
yeah it says 10. put 30 minutes

1641
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,480
um but i thought that was valuable and

1642
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,480
then

1643
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,600
um we've got scrum itself what we need

1644
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:28,080
for scrum

1645
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,960
we got most of the things right i mean i

1646
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,159
almost have really had most of the

1647
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,320
things so

1648
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:34,480
copy them down do that exercise yeah i

1649
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,440
think we're good for time all right so

1650
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:40,239
oh there we go uh let's put uh the last

1651
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,239
time box on

1652
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,440
what oh did i put five in that yes i did

1653
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,119
five last one

1654
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:49,440
last one

1655
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:50,960
and then i close the rooms uh so let me

1656
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,520
copy

1657
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,480
these post-its down to

1658
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,360
here

1659
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:59,440
has mural fixed my ability to grid

1660
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:02,239
everything no they don't connect oh

1661
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:05,199
that's nasty can i put in a roll oh my

1662
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:07,280
goodness me mural have messed up

1663
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:09,679
really nastily

1664
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:12,159
uh so let's put that

1665
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,040
here and let's put that

1666
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:14,480
there

1667
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,159
now those buttons are supposed to grid

1668
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:19,679
it but it's not working

1669
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:22,000
no working i've reported it

1670
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:23,440
they have a bug

1671
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,400
but let's see what we've got let's take

1672
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:27,520
a little uh a gallery gallery walk

1673
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,960
before everybody gets back we've got

1674
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,960
about two minutes

1675
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,840
uh so we've got courage

1676
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,239
um

1677
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:38,239
constructive challenge not afraid to

1678
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:40,560
speak up uh help overcome difficulties

1679
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:42,719
right courage to help each other and

1680
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,400
encourages openness right because that's

1681
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,880
somebody coming in from the other one

1682
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,000
not be afraid to fail seeking help if

1683
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,119
you need it

1684
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,400
that's good

1685
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:54,560
um ability to take risks and innovate

1686
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:57,360
courage to admit shortcomings right

1687
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,360
these are courageous things

1688
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:01,440
if we head into respect

1689
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,440
don't abuse your position

1690
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,320
everyone's opinion is important

1691
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,320
um give equal space to each team member

1692
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,639
appropriate body language right it's

1693
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:13,040
really important uh living up to the

1694
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,360
plan objectives respect other person's

1695
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,960
roles responsibilities negotiating good

1696
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,520
faith right and respect cultural

1697
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,440
differences as well these are good

1698
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,800
and then we're going to focus

1699
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,719
uh

1700
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,320
keep to the purpose right what are you

1701
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,480
trying to achieve here

1702
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:30,560
and it says ceremony but the events in

1703
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:32,560
scrum are they all there for a reason

1704
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,199
uh keep conversations and interactions

1705
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,639
more productive focus on what's needed

1706
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,800
to be done to deliver

1707
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:41,760
improve independent work

1708
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,560
retain focus on the methodology

1709
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,199
okay

1710
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,199
focus and then we go up to commitment

1711
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:50,000
50 seconds

1712
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:53,360
uh keeping to the quality as outlined

1713
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,280
the definition of done um collaboration

1714
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:57,199
working together keeping keeping to

1715
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,719
schedule

1716
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:00,880
i don't like that one

1717
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:03,360
um

1718
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,480
schedules schedules kind of

1719
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,119
ah

1720
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,880
yeah so commitment and schedule we're

1721
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:12,480
into fixed scope

1722
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,480
so let me put a little note on there

1723
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,760
okay do i do this there's a way i can

1724
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:21,159
make it have uh

1725
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,159
do it this way

1726
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:38,320
results in fixed scope i made that

1727
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,320
smaller boop there we go

1728
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,320
so that was the last ones i'm bringing

1729
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,679
everybody back

1730
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,280
uh

1731
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,119
working together

1732
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,639
commitment to maintain values yeah

1733
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,920
greater engagement holding each other

1734
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:57,840
accountable

1735
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,840
attendance okay and then in openness

1736
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,159
creates a mindset uh

1737
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:11,760
okay welcome back

1738
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,560
did that feel like a long time or a

1739
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,560
short amount of time

1740
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:20,000
higher amount of time

1741
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,000
okay

1742
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:24,800
what

1743
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:24,800
what did you observe was that david

1744
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:32,480
yeah what did you observe david

1745
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,480
uh

1746
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:43,920
did you feel that the vow the values are

1747
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,920
valuable

1748
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:50,239
are they gonna help teams do better

1749
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,239
yeah they would yes

1750
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,040
how do you feel

1751
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,280
how well do you feel they're implemented

1752
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,800
in your organization just now

1753
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:01,600
is there a focus on them or is there not

1754
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,600
a focus on them

1755
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:09,600
yeah fairly silly that's good i don't

1756
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:11,040
i don't have a particular opinion yeah

1757
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,840
okay

1758
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:15,440
i did notice one in commitment that i'd

1759
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,679
like to call out there's one that says

1760
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,840
keep to time schedule

1761
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:23,199
and i added a little tag that's going to

1762
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,199
result in fake scope again

1763
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:30,320
right that's delivering things within a

1764
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:32,159
time when the things we're delivering

1765
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,440
have an unknown amount of time to

1766
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:35,119
deliver them

1767
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,880
what are we going to cut

1768
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,920
to take something that we don't know how

1769
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,440
long it's going to take we're going to

1770
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,880
cut quality

1771
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,920
or we're going to cut features that's it

1772
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,920
that's our only choices

1773
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:49,040
right this is a really

1774
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,199
intrinsic learning point

1775
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:53,280
to agility

1776
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:54,719
right and it's not

1777
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,800
that

1778
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,199
waterfall can do it better

1779
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:02,880
right because we know what happens when

1780
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:04,960
we try and just manage to plan things go

1781
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,800
wrong right

1782
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,639
it gets extended because we don't know

1783
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,639
how long things are going to take in

1784
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,480
this complex cognitive world you're

1785
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,480
effectively asking people to solve

1786
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:15,760
puzzles every day

1787
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:18,159
right how long is it going to take you

1788
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,719
to solve that puzzle i don't know

1789
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:22,719
i think it might take me about

1790
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:26,000
a day because i've done a similar puzzle

1791
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,360
before and that took about a day

1792
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,719
but that doesn't mean this one's going

1793
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,080
to take a day because it's different

1794
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,600
from that one otherwise you would just

1795
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,600
use that one you wouldn't build anything

1796
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,600
new

1797
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,760
so scrum values are there to support

1798
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:46,560
the scrum framework because we can't

1799
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,480
have scrum without transparency

1800
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,280
and it is very difficult to have

1801
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:54,000
transparency when you have disrespect a

1802
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:56,880
lack of courage no focus a closed

1803
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,199
mindset and no commitment it's almost

1804
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,199
impossible to get

1805
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:03,119
transparency

1806
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:06,320
and transparency is the thing that we

1807
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,320
build everything else on

1808
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,560
have you heard of the do plan act

1809
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,119
loop

1810
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,119
right

1811
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:19,520
you you if you can't see what's going on

1812
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,880
how do you change your plan

1813
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,239
you need to be able to see what's going

1814
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,760
on you need to be able to see really

1815
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:25,119
what's going on not just what people

1816
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:27,199
tell you is going on because they're

1817
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:30,840
afraid of what you might say or some

1818
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:30,840
other thing in the organization

1819
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,480
so i brought

1820
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:39,840
um

1821
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:41,600
these uh cards for do we need it

1822
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,119
uh for scrum

1823
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,080
down here to the bottom let me actually

1824
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:45,520
make them a little bit bigger because

1825
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:48,159
we've got we've got it we've got a good

1826
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:50,639
set but it's not as many of them

1827
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:51,760
as i sometimes have so let me just grab

1828
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,320
them all

1829
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,159
make them a little i i'm okay with them

1830
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:58,800
encroaching into there go make them a

1831
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,800
little bit bigger

1832
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:02,560
so what i'd like to do something called

1833
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,040
a quick sort

1834
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:08,159
i have i have three columns here three

1835
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,920
boxes really required by scrum right

1836
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:12,719
that's things we

1837
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:16,000
have to have to maintain our ability to

1838
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:17,520
have an empirical process control system

1839
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
right that's what scrum is it's an

1840
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:23,040
empirical system empiricism just means

1841
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,480
inspect and adapt that's your

1842
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:27,040
look at it

1843
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:28,639
inspect an adapt right

1844
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,600
um

1845
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:35,119
what are complementary axes things that

1846
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:36,880
might help us but we don't have to have

1847
01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:38,560
so they're a choice

1848
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,159
right and then there might be things in

1849
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,440
here that have a negative impact i don't

1850
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:44,080
actually don't think we ended up with

1851
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:44,960
many negative things if any i don't want

1852
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,040
to

1853
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:50,960
coach it so i would like to do is just a

1854
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:53,040
free-for-all a quick sort grab a card

1855
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,320
is it required by scrum a complimentary

1856
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:56,000
practice

1857
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:57,840
or something that has a negative impact

1858
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,719
just grab a card and put it in a column

1859
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,719
let's see where we get to

1860
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:06,400
it members yeah it's gonna be hard to

1861
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,400
build stuff without team members isn't

1862
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,040
it i'm going to add

1863
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,600
scroll right

1864
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,440
let's see

1865
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:25,760
if you end up moving something into

1866
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:28,480
the box and then somebody else moves it

1867
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,400
into another box feel free to stick it

1868
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:33,400
in disputed

1869
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,400
um

1870
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:53,320
oh maybe i made the cards too big

1871
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,320
oh

1872
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:05,239
oh

1873
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,480
i i don't know i think manjit funded

1874
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:12,480
parties are necessary

1875
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,800
whoa

1876
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,800
whoa

1877
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,920
okay

1878
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,920
oh this is interesting

1879
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,560
so i am

1880
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,880
that's super interesting

1881
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,880
okay

1882
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:33,440
well that

1883
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,600
i

1884
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:37,679
so that burned down ended up in negative

1885
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:40,159
impact shows how somebody feels about

1886
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,400
burndowns right that's that's how they

1887
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:45,520
feel about it

1888
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:48,880
burndowns are in general a complementary

1889
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:50,880
practice right but i do understand how

1890
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,639
they cannot be valuable

1891
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,840
does that make sense

1892
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,440
right so just because it's a

1893
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,920
complimentary practice doesn't mean it's

1894
01:44:55,440 --> 01:45:00,000
good in all circumstances

1895
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,639
i have definitely seen lots of things

1896
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,400
have have a negative impact uh so let's

1897
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:06,239
look at what we've got in a

1898
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:08,560
complementary practices

1899
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:10,000
collaboration with the product owner

1900
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,840
right

1901
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,320
are you meaning the team's collaboration

1902
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,320
with the product tour

1903
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,920
who created that card or moved it

1904
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:24,560
i i moved it there i i think it's the

1905
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:27,040
team's collaboration yeah team

1906
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:30,320
collaboration with the product owner i i

1907
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:31,600
think that's required by scrum

1908
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:33,440
if we're not collaborating with the

1909
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,119
product owner we're not going to build a

1910
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,320
product that the product owner can take

1911
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:38,880
to their stakeholders not happy

1912
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,880
stakeholders

1913
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,239
yeah

1914
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,600
if we build something that's wrong when

1915
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:46,639
we could have just asked the product

1916
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,639
owner is that what you mean

1917
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:53,719
is that is that what you were referring

1918
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,719
to

1919
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:04,000
it's okay to stay off mute by the way

1920
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:06,560
i'm not i'm not worried about

1921
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,320
uh background noise um so we've got some

1922
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:11,280
things in complementary practice that i

1923
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,560
i agree 100 sit there

1924
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,159
story points

1925
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,480
um

1926
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:18,320
are our complementary practice

1927
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:20,480
um you don't have to have story points

1928
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:22,400
it's not mentioned in in the scrum guide

1929
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,199
burn downs complementary practice not

1930
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:26,560
mentioned team velocity not mentioned in

1931
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:28,880
the scrum guide

1932
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,880
uh scrum values ended up in

1933
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,400
complementary practice

1934
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,760
uh an increment ended up in

1935
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,040
complementary price

1936
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,560
release plans that's definitely

1937
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,760
complementary so i'm going to bring

1938
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,679
these down because they're disputed

1939
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,880
these all these are all things

1940
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,639
oh

1941
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,239
somebody keeps moving objectives over to

1942
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:47,280
negative impact

1943
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:49,440
right are you talking about kpis

1944
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:52,239
or what do you mean by objective when

1945
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,239
you put it over there

1946
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,960
well i put the sticky notes initially

1947
01:46:56,159 --> 01:47:00,960
because the team needs objectives

1948
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:03,920
but i don't know why

1949
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:07,040
it's in the negative impact yeah

1950
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,880
so um sprint goal

1951
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,880
a sprint goal is an objective and that

1952
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,440
ended up being required

1953
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,119
but maybe when when when

1954
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,239
somebody moved it over there they're

1955
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:19,199
thinking

1956
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:21,520
a kpi or some kind of measure that can

1957
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:25,119
have a negative impact on the team

1958
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:27,040
right so i i'm actually okay leaving it

1959
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:29,920
in disputed because objectives are one

1960
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:32,480
of those things that are super dangerous

1961
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,320
right that they can be incredibly bad or

1962
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,159
incredibly awesome

1963
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:38,080
we need to have objectives but we need

1964
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:40,880
to do them in a way that has a positive

1965
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:43,360
impact um so i think we just leave it in

1966
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:45,440
disputed put it kind of in the middle we

1967
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:47,760
don't need a negative impact and but it

1968
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:48,960
can go either way but what i'm more

1969
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,480
interested in

1970
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,719
is how come

1971
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:57,480
scrum values the increment product owner

1972
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:57,480
and refinement ended up in complementary

1973
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,760
would somebody like to talk about

1974
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,760
increment

1975
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,639
what what do we deliver at the end of

1976
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,639
the sprint

1977
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:18,560
we deliver an increment at the end of

1978
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:21,360
the sprint we deliver a working

1979
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,119
increment of our product

1980
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:25,280
so it's definitely not complementary

1981
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:27,679
it's a absolute

1982
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:31,440
imperative

1983
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:34,239
product owners are also imperative

1984
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,239
refinement

1985
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:38,800
refinement is imperative

1986
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,840
and scrum values are imperative so

1987
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,320
there's quite a lot of things on the

1988
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,600
left-hand side here

1989
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,840
right but we've still got lots of

1990
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,239
choices don't

1991
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,880
we still get lots of choices

1992
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:53,520
so the scrum guide

1993
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:56,000
which i do recommend you read

1994
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:57,760
is like any good game

1995
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,040
right i've got a number of board games

1996
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,880
behind me

1997
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:04,639
it has a rulebook

1998
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,639
why does a game have a rulebook cozy

1999
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,679
sorry i just got back

2000
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:15,760
oh okay no that's cool

2001
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:19,760
so a game has a rulebook

2002
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:21,520
so that we are all playing the same game

2003
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,760
what happens when you disagree over the

2004
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,840
rules

2005
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,520
you're sent off well you get sent off

2006
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,520
yeah yeah that might be in a soccer

2007
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:32,560
match yeah you might get sent off

2008
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:36,000
uh you might get a red card

2009
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:38,480
right you disagree over the rules

2010
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:41,520
so we need to have a set of

2011
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:42,880
guiding rules scaffolding

2012
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,320
that makes sure

2013
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:48,639
everybody's going in the same direction

2014
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:50,400
but we don't want to define too many

2015
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:54,080
things

2016
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:55,440
because then we end up in bureaucracy

2017
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:57,760
right we want to give people lots of

2018
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:00,239
choices for how we do things

2019
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,920
uh so let me i'm just gonna

2020
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:04,320
walk through

2021
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,320
at the scrum process for you in the last

2022
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:09,199
uh a few minutes

2023
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:11,360
like i said reading the scrum guide

2024
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:13,280
is the best way

2025
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:15,520
to to to absorb this because there's

2026
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:18,239
lots of nuance in here

2027
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,320
but i'm going to do my best to do you a

2028
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:23,119
scrum in two minutes

2029
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:25,360
uh run through i think is

2030
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:27,360
valuable right

2031
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:30,239
um we've got this

2032
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:32,880
outer box which is our sprint

2033
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:34,880
right it's time boxed usually to two

2034
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,560
weeks these days but no longer than a

2035
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,119
month

2036
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,760
and notice we have an increment inside

2037
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:45,920
of that box

2038
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:47,040
every sprint should result in a working

2039
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:50,239
product

2040
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,000
that meets your definition of done

2041
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:54,560
and your definition of done should

2042
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,480
reflect releasable

2043
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:58,400
right doesn't mean released

2044
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:59,920
just means releasable

2045
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,040
right

2046
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,360
i

2047
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,040
am always going to coach teams that they

2048
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,040
should be released

2049
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,119
at the end of every sprint every sprint

2050
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:11,040
should go to production right continuous

2051
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:12,560
delivery perhaps many times to

2052
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,239
production we have many increments

2053
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,920
during the sprint but scrum doesn't

2054
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:17,520
require that that's a complimentary

2055
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,960
practice

2056
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,360
okay

2057
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:23,920
but in in in scrum we have a product

2058
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:25,760
backlog our product backlog lists all of

2059
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,280
the things that we think we're going to

2060
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:30,400
do in the future

2061
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,840
it should be shaped by the product goal

2062
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,679
have you heard that term product goal

2063
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,639
before

2064
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,840
no

2065
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:40,719
yeah it's new in the scrum guide

2066
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:42,480
but the product goal is our intermediate

2067
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,400
strategic goal

2068
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,960
so that we can help people doing the

2069
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,239
work connect to what it is we're doing

2070
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:50,159
what are we trying to achieve over the

2071
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:52,159
next few sprints

2072
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,760
right that's the product goal

2073
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:56,480
and the things in our product backlog

2074
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,440
are refined by the scrum team

2075
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:00,320
refinement is just all the work that we

2076
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,199
do

2077
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:06,080
that's not on the current sprint

2078
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:08,080
so if we're gathering user research if

2079
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,920
we're breaking down things in the

2080
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,520
product backlog if we're adding new

2081
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,760
things these are all refinement

2082
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,080
activities

2083
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:18,800
we're then going to have an ordered well

2084
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:20,239
ordered backlog from our product owner

2085
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,560
right with the most important

2086
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:24,960
well-refined things near the top we go

2087
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:28,400
into a sprint planning

2088
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:30,400
in sprint planning we are going to craft

2089
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,560
our sprint goal

2090
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:34,880
right why are we doing this sprint what

2091
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,239
is our tactical objective

2092
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,400
this sprint

2093
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:41,760
so we come up with our sprint goal the

2094
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:44,000
team the developers are going to select

2095
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:46,639
they're pulling items from the product

2096
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,800
backlog that help them achieve that goal

2097
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,320
and creating a plan for the first 24

2098
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,159
hours

2099
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,480
that would be an implementation plan

2100
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:56,239
like break down into tasks for the first

2101
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:58,719
24 hours

2102
01:52:56,239 --> 01:53:01,360
and then every day they're going to get

2103
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:03,119
together and review the transparency of

2104
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:05,679
that plan

2105
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:09,119
does that plan still reflect

2106
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,119
transparency of the present

2107
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,040
okay so that's why i don't care about

2108
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:15,760
the three questions although i don't

2109
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:17,760
object to them right you might focus on

2110
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:20,320
value you might focus on tasks you might

2111
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,920
focus on people the purpose of the

2112
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:23,920
dailies

2113
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:27,440
is so that the sprint backlog still

2114
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:29,520
reflects transparency of the future

2115
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,119
right it's a small planning event plan

2116
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,880
the next 24 hours

2117
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,880
and then at the end of the sprint

2118
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,719
when our increment meets the definition

2119
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,800
when our product meets the definition of

2120
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:41,280
done we have an increment

2121
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,639
and the increment of working product is

2122
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:45,840
what we take to the sprint review and

2123
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:45,840
get review from stakeholders

2124
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:51,280
you want to invite as many people as you

2125
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:53,760
can anybody who cares the more people

2126
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:56,159
the better and get feedback on that

2127
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,159
increment

2128
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:04,159
then you go into a retrospective

2129
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:06,560
where we're going to inspect ourselves

2130
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:08,719
how did we do things

2131
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,880
the relationships between people we're

2132
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:12,400
going to focus on the values we're going

2133
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:15,360
to talk about the tools and how

2134
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:15,360
effective they were

2135
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:18,719
what can we do better

2136
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:22,320
and then we may be going to another

2137
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,880
sprint

2138
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:27,440
if at the sprint review our stakeholders

2139
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,119
believe we can get an additional return

2140
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:32,840
on investment by doing another sprint

2141
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:32,840
maybe we do another sprint

2142
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:40,000
does that make sense that was scrum in

2143
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,400
four minutes i did i did it in four

2144
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,199
minutes instead of two but

2145
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,199
that's the whole thing

2146
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:50,199
the mechanics of scrum are not the

2147
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:50,199
problem

2148
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:55,920
it's the values it's the

2149
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:58,000
the goals the objectives connecting

2150
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,679
people to the outcomes that you're

2151
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,080
trying to get to

2152
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:05,719
measuring people well right these are

2153
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,719
the things that are hard

2154
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,000
yeah

2155
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,639
any questions i know i i while i ran

2156
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:14,239
three minutes over i know

2157
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:16,239
a couple people had to drop

2158
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:18,239
there is a recording of this and while

2159
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:20,000
you were doing your exercises and i

2160
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:21,119
wasn't in there i was

2161
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
narrating

2162
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:26,320
um so there's maybe some value in the in

2163
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:30,440
the recording or maybe i was rambling

2164
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:30,440
um but you have any questions

2165
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,440
no thank you so i i really recommend

2166
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:40,320
giving that scrum guide a read like i

2167
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:43,840
said it takes less than an hour

2168
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:47,280
takes less than an hour to read and it's

2169
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:49,040
codifies the rules to play the game

2170
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,880
right we should at least all understand

2171
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:52,880
the rules so we're playing the same game

2172
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:57,760
then there's lots of complimentary

2173
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:57,760
practices to choose from

2174
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:05,599
okay

2175
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:08,639
yeah thank you thanks all for your time

2176
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:12,440
thank you bye thank you very much

2177
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:12,440
hopefully see you next time

2178
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:19,440
why does manji disappear okay

2179
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,320
okay so
