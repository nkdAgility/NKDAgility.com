1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,300
of why is the professional agile

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
leadership Essentials course a Natural

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,679
Evolution for an experienced product

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,980
owner

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,699
it starts to bring in

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,380
um

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,480
again as product owners

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,779
become more advanced in product

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,580
management right as they get more

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,140
skilled within the organization as they

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,140
get more respected within the

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,860
organization as having that that product

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,420
management uh feel for them they'll

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,660
start to be

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,040
um given more accountability right or

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,559
have being able to pick up more

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,020
accountability uh that's enabled for

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,200
them and they start moving into a more

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,739
leadership role as well and quite often

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,379
I I know people who are product owners

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,180
um who are not just product owners they

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,160
are systemic leaders inside of their

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,460
organization

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,979
um my favorite product owner is uh Brian

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,260
Harry who is the product unit manager of

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,900
the Azure devops team at Microsoft of

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,720
the developer division at Microsoft

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
um and he had some of something like 650

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,920
700 people

30
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,659
um that reported to him

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,100
um and he's he's the product owner he's

32
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,400
the budget holder he's the direction

33
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,080
maker the strategy designer right even

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,700
though he's taking lots of input from

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
lots of different people he's the one

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,960
that has the final say so he is the

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,759
product owner but he's also the leader

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,860
he's the people that everybody in that

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,520
engineering department looked to he was

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,520
the one that created

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,220
I'm using the wrong phrase created the

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
culture that everybody worked within but

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,360
that's not really the right phrasing

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,780
because he didn't create it he created a

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,960
system within which uh the culture that

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,180
the desired culture thrived right and

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,979
that's part of leadership right is

48
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,500
creating the systems that we all work

49
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,560
within that's slightly bigger than just

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,280
being a product owner so I think I think

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,700
it is a a logical Evolution it's the

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,260
next step uh from product ownership

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,640
um that allows

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,819
um for a better understanding of that

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,280
holistic organizational View
