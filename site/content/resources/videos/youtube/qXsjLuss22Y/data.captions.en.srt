1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:08,400
so a product goal sits somewhere between

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:10,860
the Sprint goal and the product Vision I

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,960
think of it as an intermediate strategic

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,960
goal right it's not as far away as

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,720
Vision it's closer and it's its purpose

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,039
is to connect the people that are doing

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,859
the work

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,380
with where is it we're going

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,320
if you look at Sprint goals

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,539
and Visions it's usually very difficult

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,300
to connect those two together because

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,680
everybody every single person on your

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,860
team works better if they understand how

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,180
their work that they're doing every day

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,780
contributes to the overall strategic

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,780
goal of the product
