So the question is, is the EPS immersive learning experience the equivalent of having a hands-on Scrum coach? No, but almost. I think is probably the right answer to that. 

Having somebody with your team on a continuous basis is really helpful, right? Somebody to even, even Sprints later, who you're able to get advice from and engage with is really powerful. But we kind of almost do that with our immersive class, right? So what we do is, each session includes a feedback loop, right? The assignment you get at the end of the session to try in your organisation is then debriefed before the next session, so you're closing that feedback loop. 

That includes a little bit of coaching, right? Because you're not just doing it; you're getting the feedback from it and getting coaching from the trainer slash coach who's able to help you with that. But also, it's over 10 weeks, right? Typical Sprint length is two weeks, so you actually get five Sprints' worth of help, and you're only taking one half day per week per Sprint out. 

So that's one day, ten percent of your Sprints, right? In our two-week Sprint, that's ten percent you're losing, right? That's you're losing it as productive time on the team building your product. But hopefully, what you gain back in overall effectiveness of your team over five Sprints, right? Continually coming back, closing those feedback loops, trying something new. 

How many retrospectives do you have in those five Sprints? You have five retrospectives, right? So you can get together as a team and each two weeks, each two sessions, figure out how much the training has helped you and bring that information to the next session so that the trainer can then adapt and augment the training based on the needs of you and your organisation on a continuous basis, right? That's super awesome. 

And in addition, oh, if that wasn't enough, right? The We Always Nickel Agility always offers an hour of additional coaching per person that's in the class, right? So if you're doing a 10-week, 10 weeks with us, with let's say 12 people in the class, the immersive classes are a little bit smaller, right? So you get 12 people in the class, you get an additional 12 hours of coaching and help. 

So maybe that trainer comes back for your next two or three retrospectives. Maybe they sit in on, or even during that time, right? They sit in on our Sprint review and a Sprint retrospective and your some of your dailies, and you can close some of the more of those feedback loops, get more help, get that coaching as part of the scenario. 

That is being delivered. That part is up to you, right? You have to want it because you have to use it, and you have to figure out how to include it in your process. But the APS immersive class is ultimately a 10-week, five Sprints, five Sprint kickstart for your organisation and moving towards Scrum or Kanban or whatever it is you're trying to do.
