# Is the APS immersive learning experience the equivalent of having a hands on scrum coach?

Sometimes, you just need to learn how to do #scrum properly. It isn't so much about learning the mechanics of #scrum, it's instead about how to apply #scrum professionally in your #scrumteam.

It may feel like you need an #agilecoach to help you, but sometimes, all you need is to attend an #APS or #applyingprofessionalscrum course as a team to achieve a great outcome.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how an immersive learning #APS course can simulate #agilecoaching more effectively than having an #agilecoach onboard.
