When it comes to enhancing your team's agility, the question often arises: is the EPS immersive learning experience akin to having a hands-on Scrum coach? My answer? Not quite, but it’s pretty close. Let me explain why I believe this immersive approach can be a game-changer for your organisation.

### The Power of Continuous Support

Having someone embedded within your team on a continuous basis is invaluable. This presence allows for ongoing advice and engagement, which can significantly enhance your team's performance. While the immersive class doesn’t replace a dedicated Scrum coach, it does offer a structured way to receive guidance and feedback throughout the learning process.

### Feedback Loops: The Heart of Learning

One of the standout features of our immersive sessions is the built-in feedback loop. Each session concludes with an assignment designed to be implemented in your organisation. Before the next session, we debrief on these assignments, allowing you to reflect on what worked and what didn’t. This isn’t just about doing; it’s about learning and adapting based on real-world experiences.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Each session builds on the last, creating a cycle of learning that mirrors the iterative nature of Scrum.
- **Coaching Included**: You’re not just participating; you’re receiving coaching from the trainer, who helps you navigate challenges and refine your approach.

### Maximising Your Time Investment

Over the course of ten weeks, you’ll engage in five Sprints. This means you’re only dedicating half a day per week to the immersive class—just ten percent of your Sprint time. While it may seem like a loss of productive time, the potential gains in team effectiveness can far outweigh this investment.

- **Five Retrospectives**: With each Sprint, you have the opportunity to reflect on the training’s impact. This regular check-in allows your team to assess progress and adapt the training to better suit your needs.
- **Tailored Learning**: The trainer can adjust the content based on your feedback, ensuring that the learning experience is relevant and impactful.

### Additional Coaching: A Unique Advantage

As if the immersive class wasn’t beneficial enough, we also offer an hour of additional coaching for each participant. For a class of twelve, that’s an extra twelve hours of coaching spread over the ten weeks. This additional support can take many forms:

- **Follow-Up Sessions**: The trainer can return for your retrospectives or Sprint reviews, providing insights and guidance as you implement what you’ve learned.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: By participating in your daily stand-ups or other ceremonies, the trainer can help you close feedback loops more effectively.

### Your Commitment Matters

Ultimately, the success of the EPS immersive class hinges on your willingness to engage with the process. It’s up to you to integrate the coaching and feedback into your daily practices. This immersive experience is designed to kickstart your journey towards Scrum, Kanban, or whatever agile framework you’re pursuing.

In conclusion, while the EPS immersive learning experience may not fully replace a hands-on Scrum coach, it offers a robust framework for continuous learning and improvement. By committing to this process, you can significantly enhance your team's agility and effectiveness.
