1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,160
so the question is is the EPS immersive

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,280
learning experience the equivalent of

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,660
having a Hands-On scrum coach

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,460
no but almost I think is probably the

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,359
right answer to that

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,760
um so having a a somebody with your team

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,160
on a continuous basis

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,579
um is is is really helpful right

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,399
somebody to to even even 10 Sprints

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,280
later who you're able to get advice from

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,020
and engage with is really powerful but

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,160
we kind of almost do that with our

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,180
immersive class right so what we do is

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,899
um each

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,600
because each session includes a feedback

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,920
loop right the the assignment you get at

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,920
the end of the session to try and your

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,539
organization is then debriefed before

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,780
the next session so you're closing

20
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,760
closing that feedback loop

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,180
that includes a little bit of coaching

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,740
right because you're you're not just

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,360
um and doing it you're getting the

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,700
feedback from it

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,400
um and and getting coaching from the the

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,119
trainer slash cult who's able to to help

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,659
you with that but also it's over 10

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,759
weeks right typical Sprint length

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,640
is two weeks

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,820
so you actually get five Sprints worth

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,020
of help and you're only taking one half

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,640
day

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,540
per week

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,119
per Sprint out so that's one day ten

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,460
percent of your Sprints right in our two

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,020
week Sprint that's ten percent

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,799
um you're losing right that's you're

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,220
losing it as productive time on the team

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,939
building your product but hopefully what

40
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,640
you gain back in overall effectiveness

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,060
of your team

42
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,220
over five Sprints right continually

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,079
coming back closing those feedback loops

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,020
trying something new

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,300
how many retrospectives do you have in

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,580
those five Sprints have five

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,360
retrospectives right so you can get

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,660
together as a team and each two weeks

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,780
each two sessions figure out how much

50
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,660
the training has helped you and bring

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,000
that information to the next session so

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,160
that the trainer can then adapt and

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,920
augment the training based on the needs

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,480
of you and your organization on a

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,379
continuous basis right that's super

56
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,140
awesome

57
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:40,920
and in addition oh if that wasn't enough

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:43,200
right the the the we always nickel

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,300
agility always offers an hour of

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,080
additional coaching per person that's in

61
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:53,160
the class right so if you're doing a 10

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,319
week uh uh uh 10 weeks with us uh with

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,459
let's say 12 people in the class the

64
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,140
immersive classes are a little bit

65
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,760
smaller right so you get you get 12

66
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,239
people in the class you get an

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,120
additional 12 hours of of coaching and

68
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,560
help so maybe maybe that trainer comes

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,780
back for your next two or three

70
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,900
retrospectives maybe they sit in on uh

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,400
or even during that time right they sit

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,680
in on our Sprint review in a Sprint

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,900
retrospective and you're some of your

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,819
dailies and you can close some of the

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,599
more of those feedback Clips get more

76
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,760
help get that that that coaching is part

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,920
of the scenario

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,560
um that is being delivered that part is

79
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,239
up to you right you have to want it

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,819
because you have to use it and you have

81
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,180
to figure out a how to include it in in

82
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:42,420
your process but the aps immersive class

83
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:47,159
is ultimately a a 10 week five prints

84
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,799
five Sprint uh uh Kickstart for for your

85
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,480
organization and moving towards scrum or

86
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,720
kanban or whatever it is you're trying

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,720
