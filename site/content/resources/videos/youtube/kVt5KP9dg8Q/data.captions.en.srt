1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,040
the final question for asking leadership

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,200
within the organization is going to be a

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,799
stickler um I see this in organization

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,960
after organization being a difficult

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:18,560
problem uh to discuss and that is is the

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,400
full equal system of your project agile

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:27,400
agile programming teams followed by

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,400
linear bureaucratic deployment is a

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,079
failure how many of of you out there

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,800
listening to this are working within

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,239
organizations where you're able to

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,879
continuously deliver to

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:49,120
production where there is no um human

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,520
intervention required between the

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,320
developer submitting the pool request

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,359
being approved and getting all the way

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,600
to production how many of you work in

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,160
that sort of environment where there are

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,960
no

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,400
bureaucratic uh uh things in between you

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,600
and production there may be tests

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,400
between you and production it may take

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
time for your product to roll out

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,439
because it has to go through a set of

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,000
automated standardized checks uh perhaps

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,680
does compliance things I do work with a

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
team that makes firmware for

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,840
pacemakers um and you better believe

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,479
they have a lot of compliance they have

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,680
to meet uh their software after they

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,560
create their usable working uh uh item

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,439
to ship needs to run a gauntlet of

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,439
external tests and validations but they

34
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,360
expect all of them to pass because

35
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,399
they've done all the things to ensure

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,960
that it does so it's unusual for

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,880
anything in that um um uh story to to to

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,560
be a failure that they have to have

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,680
manual processes right that little bit

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,079
of bureaucracy in their way but only to

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,520
protect people's lives it's the absolute

42
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:13,120
minimum needed to ensure that we protect

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,080
people's lives however for most systems

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,160
that we work with we want to be

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,519
delivering high enough quality to our

46
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,040
business that we're able to remove a lot

47
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,519
of those traditional bureaucratic uh

48
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,959
points in that story for example user

49
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,800
acceptance testing user acceptance

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,319
testing um if you have user acceptance

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,280
testing in your business it's because

52
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,680
it's a Value Center if your customer

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,360
insists on doing user acceptance testing

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,280
when you give them product it's because

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
it's a Value Center for them you give

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,120
them product and they find problems

57
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,120
therefore uat has added value for

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,599
them why are they finding those

59
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,319
problems they're finding those problems

60
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,400
because the quality of the the product

61
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,720
that you're giving them is not a high

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,760
high enough to pass the bar that they're

63
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,799
expecting and that they're paying you

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,799
for if it was high

65
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,680
enough then their uat wouldn't find

66
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,120
anything and would become a cost

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,440
center and then that's a conversation

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,440
about eliminating cost if it's never

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,599
finding an issue with your product it's

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
of no value to them to do it because

71
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,000
your product is high enough quality

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,720
you should all be striving to have a

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,799
high enough quality product that you

74
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,920
don't need additional checks and

75
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,680
validations if you need to have

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,480
something that somebody else wants to

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,760
see as part of your process bake it into

78
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,760
your definition of done bake it into the

79
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,400
way you build software so quality is so

80
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,040
high you don't even have to worry about

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,079
it you can continuously ship to

82
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,879
production if your answer to any one of

83
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,360
these questions or the answer of your

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,239
business to any one of these questions

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,360
is no we're not doing that then you

86
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,879
would probably I probably wouldn't

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,120
consider that you're already in the

88
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,560
agile space right you're not already

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,079
agile you might be working towards it

90
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,160
and you might have put in loads of

91
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:28,440
effort but unless you can Mark every

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:32,039
single one of these six questions as yes

93
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,240
we do this this is how things work here

94
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:38,120
then we're still lacking we're still

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,400
trying we're still working towards being

96
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:45,639
agile now this is just a litmus test

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,440
dreamed up uh by uh the US Department of

98
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:52,280
Defense but they are probably the least

99
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,639
likely place for you to expect something

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,919
um with this High a bar to have come

101
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,120
from and I'm not going to um go into a

102
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,600
team uh and work with a team or a

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,080
company and if they're not doing these

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,720
things then I'm going to say well you

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,880
guys suck you're not agile because

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,840
you're not doing this that's that's not

107
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:16,360
how we work towards success uh but I

108
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,479
think it's hugely valuable from the

109
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,360
perspective of

110
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,000
self-reflection for you all to think

111
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,199
about the processes and practices in

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,319
your organization and are you a how many

113
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,280
of these six questions are you able to

114
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,759
achieve

115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,039
and what could you do to make it a

116
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,840
little bit easier for the teams for the

117
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:46,800
people doing the work to work

118
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,800
towards this idea of not being agile BS
