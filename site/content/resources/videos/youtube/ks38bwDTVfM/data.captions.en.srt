1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,839
number one have a definition of done

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,640
that would be great right know the

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:09,599
amount of work you need to do in order

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,880
to get to done that's part of the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,960
purpose of the definition of done how do

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,320
you know how does every member of your

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,160
team know when they're thinking about

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,279
how much work they can take on in a

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
Sprint what they actually need to do to

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,720
get there right that's your your your

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,640
definition of done helps enable

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,960
that

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,320
so also the second thing is probably uh

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,280
stop taking on too much work that's

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,200
always a good one um most teams will

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,200
take on um the amount of work that they

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,440
feel will fit in a Sprint and that's

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,199
wrong right you shouldn't take on the

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,359
amount of work that should fit in a

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:56,680
Sprint you need to think first about how

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,480
much time you need to reserve for other

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,280
things okay so there are a number of

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,360
other things you need to reserve time

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,200
for in the Sprint one is uh how much

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,640
time do you have to spend paying back

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,720
technical debt that's one uh perhaps

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,640
you've got some some refactors or re

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,799
architectures to do there's work around

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,560
that uh perhaps there's been some

30
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:21,840
production issues and you want to go

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,759
figure out and rework some of the way

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,280
you've done things in order to make

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,479
those production issues less likely

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,360
there's a bunch of work perhaps there's

35
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,079
just some bugs you need to go fix

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,240
there's things that that customers have

37
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,360
asked for or feedback uh that are small

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
things you'd never have a whole Sprint

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,280
just on those things but you've got a

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:49,119
bunch of bunch of stuff there um and

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:54,040
then you need to think about um how

42
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,240
much work do you think is left in order

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,840
to fulfill your Sprint backlog this is

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,640
your net new work uh that goes to

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,960
towards your your Sprint goal uh that

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,840
you're going to do the Sprint so this is

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,720
the high complexity work usually fixing

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,440
above can be really simple or it can be

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,440
really hard right you don't you don't

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,400
know but all of net new functionality is

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,560
generally really complex and very

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,840
unknown so you need to have enough space

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,800
to take on a piece of work that might

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,840
expand to fill that space right and

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
there's one thing which is the third

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,840
thing that I've not talked about and

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,239
that's ref refinement how much time do

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,519
you need to think about refinement that

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,040
needs reserved cuz the third thing

60
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:44,040
refinement you need to understand the

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,720
future to some degree right a lot of

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,280
folks talk about oh we're doing agile we

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,800
don't need to do planning anymore that's

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,480
crap you need to do more planning and

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,319
more often and one of those things that

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,879
we do we call refinement which is any

67
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:03,760
work that you do as a team that is

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,280
looking at the product backlog not

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,440
adding capability to your increment

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,000
right so if you're looking out into the

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,239
future and you're saying uh what are the

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,360
things that are coming up in the backlog

73
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,720
are they the right size maybe we need to

74
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
break them down um do they have

75
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,440
dependencies that we need to plan for

76
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,640
right if you get into Sprint planning

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,040
and you realize that you need a firewall

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,840
change uh that has a 6 week lead time

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,720
you're already screwed right that's not

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,400
happening this Sprint even though that's

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,840
when it needs to happen because we've

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,439
got this firewall change whereas if

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,280
we're looking out 6 weeks into the

84
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,959
future in our product backlog and

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,519
anticipating trying to anticipate as

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,959
best we can you're never going to be

87
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,840
perfect but as best you can what's

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,439
coming up that we need to deal with

89
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,599
those dependencies those different

90
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,840
activities that we need to request stuff

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,680
or do stuff you know could be servers

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,720
could be environments could be all sort

93
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,519
sorts of things uh that could get in the

94
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,959
way what do you need to know now you can

95
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:11,239
mitigate a lot of that by your scrum

96
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,760
Masters should be thinking about well

97
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,680
why do we have to look out 6 weeks for

98
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,639
firewall changes well it's because this

99
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
team over here takes six weeks to action

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,040
a firewall change perhaps that's

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
something you want to go fix so you

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,639
don't have to look out so far on your

103
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,479
product back clug and you can bring that

104
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,280
range in right because you want how far

105
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,800
out you look should be minimal but

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,759
sufficient right you got that goldilock

107
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,240
zone of how far do we need to look out

108
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
and you want it to be as short as

109
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,840
possible so any other activities you can

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,000
do to make that shorter so those are the

111
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,520
three things uh that a team who

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,560
struggling to get work completing the

113
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Sprint Sprint need to think about you

114
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,039
need to think about doing good

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,360
refinement if you understand things a

116
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,800
little bit more you'd be surprised how

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,600
much more easily they fit in a Sprint

118
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,120
you need to not plan the whole Sprint

119
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,639
just plan the

120
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,960
bit that that that you believe you can

121
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,680
do and take into account those other

122
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,960
activities that you need to do every

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,840
Sprint don't fill the whole thing that's

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,199
mental um and the other one was having a

125
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,080
definition of done so that you

126
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,720
understand the amount of work that is

127
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,880
required to complete each thing thanks
