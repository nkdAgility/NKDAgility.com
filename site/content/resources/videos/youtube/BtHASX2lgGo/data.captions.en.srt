1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,279
a common thing that agile teams do is

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,599
they use burnd Downs to figure out uh

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,559
how things are going throughout the

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,160
Sprint I've got to say burnd Downs are

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,119
agile

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,160
banditry the whole idea of burnd Downs

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,039
in order for a burndown to move from top

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,000
left to bottom right in a reasonable

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,960
linear fashion you have to have planned

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
the whole Sprint up

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440
front right in order to have a project

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,760
burned down or a product burn down

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,760
moving from top left to bottom right you

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,520
have to have planned the whole product

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,559
or project up

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,960
front hopefully we can all be on the

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,160
same page that if we're doing if we're

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,239
building products that don't exist yet

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,559
right we're developing products that

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,480
don't exist then there's too much

21
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,920
variance too many surprises too much

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,440
complexity in what it is we're doing to

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,680
to really plan the next 6 months worth

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,840
of work it's always going to change more

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,159
than we would like and if we look at

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,479
data from like the Standish group uh

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,479
that do the chaos report for example

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,479
you'll find that that

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,040
65% of uh things that we build change

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,759
over the life of the product and in fact

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,759
even worse than that only 30% of the

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,799
features that we do build are actually

33
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,119
used by our custom customers the rest

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,280
are used little if ever right so that

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,880
bring those two things together we have

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,360
a massive amount of unknowns in what

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,079
we're doing it's usually always more

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,040
than 50% so we know less than half of

39
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,360
what we're going to have to figure out

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,880
along the way and that means that being

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,840
able to plan up front even the next

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,560
10day Sprint is just a ridiculous

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,880
exercise in making stuff up ridiculous

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,720
exercise in telling a fictional story

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,920
the reality is you should walk out of

46
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Sprint planning with no more than is

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,640
needed to get started that's how big

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,080
your plan should be getting started in

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,160
the Sprint how big should your plan be

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,760
for your product enough to get

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,200
started right or enough to convince

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,959
somebody to give you the money that's

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,280
also you know you might need more for

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
that but that ability to get started is

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,319
all you need so you maybe walk out of

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,760
Sprint planning with 24 hours worth of

57
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,400
work we've plan the next 24 hours cuz

58
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,239
we're going to get together every 24

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,840
hours and plan the next 24 hours after

60
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,800
that so we don't really need more than

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,920
the first 24 hours to get started if

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,599
we're going to build a product we don't

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,440
really need that much more than the

64
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,920
first Sprint to get started what of the

65
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
backlog items we're going to do maybe

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,400
during that Sprint we can come up with

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,760
you know how far out into the future we

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
do want to look but you want it to be

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,040
minimal but sufficient you want to have

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,400
less stuff to manage less stuff in these

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,360
things that's why H burnd Downs are one

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,319
of the

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,080
reasons that you can't tell what's going

74
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:27,400
on this is the banditry part of H um it

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,400
being for Bandits it's that um if I if I

76
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,000
plan the whole Sprint right

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
um and I've get let's say I've got five

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,920
developers working on my product and

79
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,239
I've got five stories coming into the

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,680
backlog and each of those five stories

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,400
has 10 tasks that I'm going to write

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,799
down as part of my plan how many per

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,959
person right how many tasks do I have at

84
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:56,280
the end I have lots of lots and lots and

85
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,040
lots of tasks what happens on day two of

86
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,680
the Sprint when you figure out that your

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,959
plan wasn't that great and 50% of it

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,000
needs to change because you figured out

89
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,640
something

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,079
new it gets out of date and the reason

91
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,200
it gets out of date is because none of

92
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,799
your developers they they want to focus

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,799
on delivering the stuff because we're

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
under pressure to deliver the product

95
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,400
deliver the value and yet they need to

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,199
go and edit or manage these hundred

97
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,919
things that are in the in in the Sprint

98
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,840
backlog right don't have them there you

99
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,479
don't need them all you need is a just

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,840
in time just enough plan either for the

101
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:40,320
Sprint or adjus in time just enough plan

102
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,639
for your product in order to start get

103
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,320
started and get developing uh your

104
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,639
product so don't get stuck uh in that

105
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,720
rut of too much planning up front which

106
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:57,840
is what a burndown forces you to do stop

107
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,120
being a bunch of agile Bandits and focus

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,960
instead on continuous flow of value

109
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,960
through your system if you are being

110
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,360
ambushed by agile bandits in your

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,320
organization then my team at naked

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,240
agility can help or we can help you find

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,639
a consultant or expert who can you can

114
