1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,980
the question is why is the professional

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,080
agile leadership Essentials class a kind

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,179
of core Evolution

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,920
um for a scrum master and and I think

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,980
again there's two there's two great

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,260
reasons the first one is that

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,160
um it enables

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,220
a scrum Master to hear

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,220
the questions that leaders have that

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,260
leaders and managers have about scrum

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,880
about the contacts that we're talking

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,980
about right

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,620
um they get to hear some of the other

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,440
ways that it's important to them or that

15
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,440
we can solve problems for them

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,300
um but also it enables

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,960
I I I think of the scrum Master as being

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,340
the first rung on the leadership track

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,379
right the the this idea that

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,780
um I call them kind of gold shirts right

21
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,339
like the Star Trek idea you you get

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,840
people that are on the leadership track

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,979
and you get people that aren't really

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,299
interested in the leadership track

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,860
there's loads of people out there who

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,520
are quite happy being software Engineers

27
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,260
right they're quite happy uh uh um you

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,640
know being being Scotty running these

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,040
engineering department they don't want

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,600
to be in charge of the ship at all

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,520
so

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,740
um we need to be able to cater for both

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,979
of those groups and the scrum Master is

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,960
a natural uh uh uh position of of

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,220
leadership they're a leader who serves

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,680
the team

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,600
and then the next level up is the leader

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,180
who serves a bunch of teams and the next

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,280
level up is the leader who serves a part

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,960
of the organization or the leader who

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,220
sells or serves the actual organization

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,520
right

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,159
um so that gives you that kind of

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,700
um leadership track of the organization

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,479
and for the scrum Master learning the

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,060
language the Lexicon the problems

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,340
um the the leaders see it those levels

48
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,299
will help them better serve people at

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,460
those different levels in the

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,439
organization
