The material is deep but exclusively focused on management theory, project management history, command-and-control structures, and general agile evolution. The target audience (project managers, agile practitioners) modestly overlaps with the SLE category but, since no SLE content is present, neither the intent nor the bulk of the information aligns with the required topic. All signal in the content is dedicated to Taylorism, not SLE; thus, scores for mentions, alignment, depth, and intent are zero. Minor nonzero scores for 'audience' and 'signal' reflect partial overlap in readership and general agile relevance, but these are not sufficient for classification under 'Service Level Expectation.' Penalties were not applied, as the content is not outdated or critical—it's simply off-topic for this specific category.",
