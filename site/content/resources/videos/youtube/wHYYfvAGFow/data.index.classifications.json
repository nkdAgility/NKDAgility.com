Audience targeting is relatively higher because Agile practitioners are one of the groups addressed, but most content is not tuned for those seeking to understand DoD.

    "reasoning": "The content is a detailed review of Taylorism and its legacy in project management, outlining command-and-control methods and their adaptation to modern processes such as Agile. While it briefly references the need for evolved, people-centric frameworks (as in Agile), it does not explicitly or deeply address the maximisation of agency for humans or AI, systemic observability, ethical AI, or agentic engineering practices. There is no direct or explicit mention of 'Agentic Engineering,' nor is the conceptual alignment or depth sufficient. The main focus is retrospective historical analysis rather than prospective agentic practice, though the intended audience (agile practitioners and transformation leads) partly overlaps.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content mainly analyzes Taylorism and traditional project management. While it acknowledges Agile as a people-centric evolution, it lacks direct discussion of maximizing agency, feedback-driven environments, or integrating AI â€” making its fit with Agentic Engineering minimal.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on Taylorism, command-and-control management, and the evolution of traditional project management. There are zero explicit or implicit references to agentic principles, autonomous AI agents, human-AI integration, or any of the key topics associated with Agentic Software Delivery. The only adjacent topic is a brief positive mention of Agile practices, but this is neither tied to agentic concepts nor framed around AI or proactivity. There is no discussion of software delivery as it relates to AI agency, contextual intelligence, governance of agentic systems, or outcome-focused model evolution toward agentic approaches. All scoring is very low as the content is unrelated except for a slender thematic link via project management and the notion of evolution in delivery models.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about Taylorism and traditional project managementâ€”not Agentic Software Delivery. No AI, agency, or agentic integration is discussed. At best, itâ€™s tangential via its mention of evolving delivery models, so the categorical fit is extremely low.",
