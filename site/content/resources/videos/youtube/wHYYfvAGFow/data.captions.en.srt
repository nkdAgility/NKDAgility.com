1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:14,219
the question was what is Terrorism and

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,420
how did it influence project management

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,160
and I think that's an interesting

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,320
question because

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,039
um taylorism let's let's quantify that

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:25,019
first uh taylorism is it's the name of a

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
gentleman called Frederick Winslow

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,260
Taylor

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,460
who back in the 1880s 1890s he was kind

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,880
of like the thought leader the

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,579
Management Consultant of the time and he

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,300
uh worked with all of these big Factory

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,399
owners he did a Time In Motion study

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,800
um about the work trying to figure out

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,739
how do we get better at delivering more

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,140
stuff because in those days the outcomes

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,219
were guaranteed right because you had a

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,079
factory that made uh um clocks and you

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,000
know you're gonna get clocks out the

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,559
other end of the factory we just want

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,380
more clocks supply and demand but in

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,360
that in that world

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,720
um during the Industrial Revolution the

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,640
demand was much higher than the supply

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,280
so we had very very uh um sparse markets

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,200
not so much competition

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,119
um we didn't have that globalization so

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,920
if you were making clocks in in in in

29
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,299
Europe you were selling in if you made

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,340
clocks in the UK you were probably

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,020
selling in the UK if you made clocks in

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,040
China you were probably selling in China

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,320
right they didn't have that

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,320
globalization so competition

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,560
um was very low and customers didn't

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,960
really know much about the products that

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,479
they were buying so they just bought

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,880
what they were provided right they

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,920
weren't asking for different things they

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,360
weren't trying to get

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,920
different stuff

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,600
so you had this very low uh Dynamic low

43
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,180
Dynamic

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,799
um low competition Marketplace and a

45
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,619
whole bunch of tools and practices were

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,479
developed around this space

47
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,399
um so Frederick Winslow Taylor is what

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,020
we call it taylorism uh developed a

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,580
bunch of these techniques started

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,040
developing them and one of the

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,879
fundamental basis basis that they worked

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
with

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,400
was because

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,459
um people doing doing monotonous factory

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,840
work because they disconnect from the

56
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,300
work

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,920
you find that they try everything they

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,680
can not to work

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,640
so there's this famous quote uh from

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,599
Taylor

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,180
Let's uh let me think uh not a competent

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,060
worker can be now a competent worker can

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,940
be found that does not devote a

64
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,060
considerable amount of time to studying

65
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,280
just how slowly they can work and still

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,580
convince their employer they're going at

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,580
a good pace and I'm sure

68
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,500
listening to this you're all thinking of

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,860
those companies that you've worked for

70
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,140
and with that have that ethos at their

71
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,480
heart that employees are inherently

72
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,040
untrustworthy they're inherently not

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,300
going to do their job unless we're much

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,099
watching them

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,879
treating people like Factory workers

76
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,040
right and and we need to keep an eye on

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,120
them we need a foreman to keep an eye on

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,739
the people and then maybe we need

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,120
managers to keep an eye on the foreman

80
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,780
and managers to keep an eye on those

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,879
managers depending on how big we get and

82
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,159
hierarchy is born right you get

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,540
hierarchies and then because we're going

84
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,099
to put the thinkers at the top of the

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,959
organization and the doors at the bottom

86
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,340
of the organization because the doers

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,620
don't need to think right they're just

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,080
making more stuff we know what we're

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,299
going to create we're creating clocks uh

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,540
then we can we can create these

91
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,180
hierarchical steering uh based

92
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,360
organizations where budget comes from

93
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,819
the top decisions are made at the top uh

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,340
Direction comes from the top

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,580
and then that that kind of progressed

96
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,239
through into uh through through the

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:07,400
Gantt chart in 1906 from from uh

98
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:11,040
um Henry Gantt uh through into the 1950s

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,260
where the US industrial military complex

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,079
took a hold of many of these ideas and

101
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,180
started uh incorporating them into the

102
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,820
work the way they work so you want to

103
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,620
divide people into ability-based groups

104
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,540
um you want to standardize the processes

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,000
that they do train that group only in

106
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,220
those processes and hey ho we ended up

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,020
with uh departments across our

108
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,960
organizations with the sales department

109
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,479
and the marketing department and the

110
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,040
um coding department and the testing

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,780
department and the operations Department

112
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,780
right let's keep them separate train

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,440
them only in those ability-based groups

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,600
so out of those ideas was born those

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,500
traditional project management methods

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,540
now a lot of work has been done recently

117
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,540
to try and

118
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,360
curtail or morph many of those uh

119
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,919
traditional uh uh outlooks to a more

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,960
people focus because it was a staff

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
focused Outlook

122
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,199
um and that's but that stuff focused

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,500
Outlook is still at the heart of a lot

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,680
of those uh those techniques yes I do

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,000
know fantastic fantastic project

126
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,680
managers

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,060
um that don't focus on the stuff they

128
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,759
focus on the people and they get great

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,460
results but in my experience those those

130
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,919
folks are super rare they're booking a

131
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,919
trend uh they're not the mass produced

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,080
uh project manager that you find

133
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,039
um out in The Ether and what what's

134
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,020
happening is that project that plan

135
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,600
becomes the gold standard rather than

136
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,280
planning becoming the gold standard

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,419
and so

138
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,360
taylorism is really the source of if you

139
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,180
if you if you read about taylorism uh

140
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,740
you read about the the the the the

141
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,919
Scientific Management method you'll see

142
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,199
that influence going through all of the

143
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
um stuff up until the the modern era

144
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,340
even through the lean Toyota production

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,620
system right which was an adaption of

146
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,100
those techniques for the more modern

147
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,960
world of the 1950s when uh at markets

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,759
were getting more crowded right so they

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,500
needed new techniques to be able to move

150
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,880
even faster

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,340
um and that was a lean Toyota production

152
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,500
system but as we move into the the the

153
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,139
modern world

154
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,960
um and even even

155
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:27,600
May 50 60 70 years ago and there weren't

156
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
really any of these these markets that

157
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,479
were

158
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
um low competition left right

159
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,660
everything's High competition high

160
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
demand High uh variability in all the

161
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,500
things that we do people starting to

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,720
want demand custom capabilities from

163
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,060
their organizations which is why car

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,020
manufacturers are increasingly adopting

165
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,120
agile practices so that they can

166
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,639
start delivering these custom

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,280
capabilities dynamically and quickly to

168
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,220
their customers incorporating the design

169
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,020
of the products into the actual delivery

170
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,819
of the products rather than keeping them

171
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,979
a separate things right design it and

172
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,900
then deliver it they need to constantly

173
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,039
be adapting and changing

174
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:15,000
um so taylorism created Created was the

175
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,180
source of those uh um traditional

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,360
project management practices but there

177
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,620
are many practices Tools in traditional

178
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,479
project management that are still just

179
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,139
as valid today throughout the baby with

180
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,840
the bath water but try and figure out

181
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,660
how to increase your adaptability reduce

182
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,940
your bureaucracy

183
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,520
um reduce the plan

184
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,520
increase planning and deliver more value
