1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:15,560
the next harbinger of the agile

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:20,600
apocalypse is war and War manifests in

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,279
organizations um as a distrust it

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,439
manifests as politics it manifests as

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:29,599
disagreement and effectively results in

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,200
conflict and there are multip multiple

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,559
levels of conflict that happen within

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,399
your organization uh you might start

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,480
with just a simple dispute right we're

10
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,280
not sure how to do something we're

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,840
having a conversation those those things

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,760
are kind of kind of easy uh easier to

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,359
work through and as you move up you get

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,559
to um

15
00:00:51,359 --> 00:01:01,079
more more conflict more things happening

16
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:04,320
more disagreement like I it becomes not

17
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,000
about what we can do to move

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,439
forward but it becomes what I can do to

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,479
make you

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,400
lose right that's when you transition

21
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,400
from a collaborative environment where

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,560
you do you do want constructive

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,079
disagreement right you want constructive

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,720
arguments because I I I I firmly believe

25
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:29,360
that arguments and discussion and debate

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,560
is like the the the the Flint on steel

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,560
generated the Sparks of ideas that start

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,600
the fires in your organization that

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,360
enact change that enact uh new products

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,040
enact new ideas right you need some

31
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,040
level of conflict within your

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,840
organization but as soon as it moves to

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,360
the point where I win and you lose right

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,840
where where that that that my job

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,719
becomes not winning but making sure you

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,960
lose cuz I don't like what you're doing

37
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,680
that's when it escalates into allout war

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,599
and it becomes not about collaboratively

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,680
moving forward it becomes about winning

40
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:16,440
and winning isn't always the right

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,360
answer don't let your your organization

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,120
degenerate into

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,040
