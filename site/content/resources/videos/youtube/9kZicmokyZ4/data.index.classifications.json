Though 'Product Delivery' is never directly named, the discussion covers several practices that underpin product delivery in Agile (iterative improvement, KPI tracking, transparency, feedback loops). Coverage is thorough but somewhat generalized—tooling, deployment, and explicit DevOps/CI/CD practices are mentioned only indirectly via metrics. Audience targeting is strong (Agile practitioners), and focus remains high on relevant themes. Small deductions for not mentioning deployment or release strategies explicitly. No outmoded practices or negative framing detected.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Strong conceptual fit: EBM in Agile closely relates to product delivery through its focus on metrics, feedback loops, and decision-making. Does not explicitly name 'product delivery' or cover deployment details, but overall intent and theme align well.",
