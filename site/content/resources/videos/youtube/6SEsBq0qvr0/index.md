 🧾 Definition of Done vs. Acceptance Criteria — Know the Difference
🎥 Episode 9 of 10 — Just Released

📍 One defines quality. The other defines scope.

Confusing the two? That’s a recipe for:
⚠️ Missed expectations
⚠️ Hidden risks
⚠️ Broken trust

Let’s break it down:
🟦 Acceptance Criteria = Per item.
→ “Did we meet this specific need?”
🟩 Definition of Done = Org-wide standard.
→ “Is this increment ready for production?”

DoD applies to everything.
✅ Security
✅ Testing
✅ Telemetry
✅ Deployment readiness
✅ Compliance
Not optional. Not negotiable. Not story-specific.

At NKD Agility, we help teams clear up this confusion—so they can move fast without cutting corners, and customers get reliable, consistent outcomes.
