1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,920
if you want to

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,000
build teams and an

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,599
organization that can deliver the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,960
highest possible value for the

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,640
investment that you're taking maximize

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,680
that return on investment for your

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,359
business then naked agility can help

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,960
you in

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,400
advising and coaching at any level in

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,160
your organization be it team members who

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,160
are actually doing doing the work in the

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,399
engineering practices that they're doing

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,840
all the way up through to you as a CTO

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:49,280
or CEO trying to understand hypothesis

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,960
driven practices trying to understand

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,680
which features should we bring in which

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,520
features should we not how do we budget

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,120
across our engineering practices

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,879
organization so that we maximize a

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,040
return investment and

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,240
maximize the care within which the

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,040
people doing the work take of their time

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,479
and the spend that they are making which

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,159
is hugely important understanding that

25
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,759
context enabling the highest quality of

26
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,759
work right we want if we're building

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,079
software

28
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,640
products regardless of whether we're

29
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,400
that's our main business or whether it's

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,479
a side hustle for our business right is

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,640
an enable

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,960
for our

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,119
business we want to build products of

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,439
the highest possible quality every

35
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,040
product that we build every line of code

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,439
that is written by the people in our

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,320
teams is an organizational asset right

38
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,520
these are things that provide it's like

39
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,799
buying a building it's infrastructure

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,880
right it's stuff that you've built that

41
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,680
you've invested in that you get return

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,000
investment on that you get a continuous

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,600
return on are they of the highest

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,320
quality if you bought a bill

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
as a as as as as a leadership in an

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,799
organization you're going to do a lot of

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,239
due diligence and the due diligence for

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,440
that is well known when it's software

49
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,560
there's a lot of opacity there's the

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
stuff the magic Wizards do that build

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
the software and we don't often

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,280
understand all of the ramifications of

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,239
that so we need to have some technical

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,440
expertise on hand whether it be in-

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,400
house or bringing somebody in

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,319
that helps us understand some of those

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,440
relationships and some of those the

58
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,280
things that connect to each other in

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,519
order to maximize the value that our

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,519
business is able to bring to Market
