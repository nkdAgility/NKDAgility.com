**Worst agile advice you've ever heard?**

The Worst Scrum Master's Advice -  Ever! 🚫

In my articles, I don't often talk about negative aspects of Agile and Scrum, but today I want to talk about one of the worst pieces of Agile advice I've ever heard, which was, "Everyone MUST stand up during the daily stand-up, or you're not doing Scrum." 😱

I recall working with a Seattle team where a Scrum Master adopted an overly dogmatic and totalitarian approach. This Scrum Master insisted that everyone stand up during the daily Scrum, ignoring that a team member was bound to a wheelchair. In a spirit of inclusivity, the team chose to sit down so they weren't towering over their colleague. 👏

I have to point out that this isn't just bad advice from a Scrum Master. This is a complete misunderstanding of the core Agile principle of flexibility and the Scrum value of respect. 🙌

The very last thing that Agile is about is rigid, one-size-fits-all rules. Quite the opposite, Agile is about adapting processes to meet different teams' unique needs and contexts. That's Agile's very essence and power – every team can (and should) do things differently to achieve the best results. ✅

So, remember, rules and routines in Agile and Scrum are essential, but they are secondary to the human-centric nature of these methodologies.

Don't let dogmatic or totalitarian approaches cloud the true embodiment of Agile. Check out my Agile and Scrum courses to learn more about this holistic approach to team management. 📈💡
