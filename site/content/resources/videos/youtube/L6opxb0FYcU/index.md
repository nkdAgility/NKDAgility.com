# Worst agile advice heard?

#shorts #agile values and principles set the scene for environments where we value and respect people a great deal, and where we seek to discover new and better ways of doing things over repeating the same things over and again in the hope that we achieve a positive outcome.

That said, #agiledogma still exists and there are people who focus on the mechanics of #agile or #scrum rather than the principles and values that underpin #agile, which sometimes leads to disasters.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood provides an example of one of the worst applications of #agiledogma that he has heard of.
