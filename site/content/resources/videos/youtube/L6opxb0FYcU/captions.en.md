So one of the worst things I ever heard about in agile was actually when I was working in the US as a consultant in Seattle and I came in to help a team in an organization and they just fired their scrum master.

What their scrum master had done was be very dogmatic and totalitarian and had decided that the daily stand-up, not daily scrum, but daily stand-up, everybody had to be standing up in it or they weren't doing scrum.

And it just so happened that this team had a disabled person on the team in a wheelchair and the team had decided collectively to all sit down so they weren't towering over the person that was in a wheelchair.

For me that is absolutely the very purpose and power of agile that every team can do something differently and that scrum master sure deserved to be fired.
