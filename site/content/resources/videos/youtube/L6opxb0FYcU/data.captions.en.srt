1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
so one of the worst things I ever heard

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,980
about in agile was actually when I was

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,260
working in in the US

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,080
um as a consultant in Seattle and I came

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,540
in to help a team in an organization and

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,720
they just fired their scrum master

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,320
and what their scrum Master had done it

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,720
was be very dogmatic and totalitarian

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,760
and had decided that the daily stand-up

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,680
not daily scrum but daily stand-up

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,539
everybody had to be standing up in it or

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,759
they weren't doing scrum

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,219
and it just so happened that this team

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,860
had a disabled person on the team in a

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,860
wheelchair and the team had decided

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,420
collectively to all sit down so they

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,500
weren't towering over the person that

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,140
was in a in a wheelchair for me that is

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,360
absolutely the very purpose and power of

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,940
agile that every team can do something

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,199
differently and that scrum Master sure

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,199
deserved to be fired
