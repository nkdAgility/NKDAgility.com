While the depth of discussion on a philosophical or systemic level is limited and more practical in orientation, there is clear attention to agency and decentralisation in the DevOps context, especially in topics like ownership, team-driven deployment, and decision-making authority. The focus is primarily on practical DevOps adoption rather than a thorough exploration of agentic engineering as an integrative concept involving AI, ethical autonomy, or explicit decision frameworks, so alignment and depth scores are modestly above average.
