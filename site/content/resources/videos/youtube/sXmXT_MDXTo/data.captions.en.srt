1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,760
we've been doing

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:11,519
devops for quite some time um

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,400
the it's really difficult to

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,240
provide an overview of our devop

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,600
services

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,680
because our devop services tend to be

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,920
bespoke for every single customer that

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,119
uses them there's there's not there's

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,920
some patterns but there's not that many

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,040
formulas that work everywhere every

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,000
company is different every group of

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,399
people is different every outcome that

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,239
they're trying to achieve with uh uh the

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,480
the philosophy that is devops right

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,840
every outcome that they're trying to

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,320
achieve is different so but there are

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,359
some patterns that do kind of make

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,879
sense um one of those is um one of the

19
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,079
patterns we use quite often is a state

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,519
of devops report um so the idea is the

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,320
you want to understand as an

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:09,479
organization like where based on Modern

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,880
engineering and devops

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,600
practices where are we where are we

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,320
where do we sit because it's difficult

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,240
to understand where you want to go

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,520
unless you know where you are right now

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,479
that's the first thing you do when you

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,840
have a map and you're trying to figure

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,240
out how to get somewhere you have to

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,520
find out where you are so you can then

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,159
figure out what the direction to go um

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,360
so that kind of state of devops state of

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,360
agile state of devops where are we right

35
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,600
now um in in our our understanding of or

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,640
our application of what of devops

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,399
practices so um we might talk about

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:55,119
things like H how how are products being

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:58,399
released um we might talk about things

40
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:03,280
um like wow wow how are how are products

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,479
been released um what sort of um tools

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,679
are being used within that context of of

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,800
releasing products um I worked with an

44
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,640
organization that had 13 different

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,879
Source control systems in use for one

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,879
product right so there's there's a lot

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,360
of waste there that can be identified um

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,040
what what are we actually doing how do

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,080
we how do we take the ideas that we've

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,480
created in our product and and how how

51
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,519
do they actually get into production and

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,560
not just what leadership thinks is

53
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,239
happening but what's actually happening

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,239
on the ground um so we tend to interview

55
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,200
a bunch of people in the organization

56
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,680
usually try and do solo interviews

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
because people are more willing to speak

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,200
when there's not somebody else and this

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,879
kind of anonymous uh uh

60
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,519
information and we find out all sorts of

61
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,480
things like I worked with an

62
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,840
organization that was their team

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,720
understood their team of 30 engineers

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,519
understood branching but they didn't

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,360
understand automatic merging so they

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,280
were manually copying code with a a text

67
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,720
diffing to between branches in order to

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,360
merge code which is just mental um I

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,280
worked with an organization that had

70
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,159
built a custom tool because the business

71
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,720
had asked for a capability they built a

72
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,560
custom tool that allowed product

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,959
managers to pick

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,200
features and create a build of the

75
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,680
product that only had those features

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,599
merged together into the product um

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,000
which might sound like a good idea if

78
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,080
you're on the business side but from an

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,360
engineering standpoint and creating a a

80
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,640
cohesive valid high quality usable high

81
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,840
value product that's that's totally

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,480
insane um there's all sorts of

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,840
things

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,720
that are non dysfunctional behaviors I

85
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,079
tend to call them opportunities for

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,920
improvement right because it's a little

87
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,799
bit more positive but the reality is

88
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,000
they're dysfunctional behaviors that are

89
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,439
really common in the industry and have

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,720
been for many years because people are

91
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,600
pushed towards solving a problem and

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,560
they don't necessarily know that there

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,840
are known logical ways to solve that

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
problem already and even if they do know

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,600
about those non-logical ways to solve

96
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,199
that problem somebody in the business

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,240
has an objection to to it uh a great one

98
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,880
is automatic deployments right uh and

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,080
the the the the objection might be that

100
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,680
oh are we're under socks audit you know

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,440
we we're we're sarban Oxley compliant

102
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,360
therefore um we we need a separation of

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,800
developers from uh the people who do

104
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,000
develop the code the people who do

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,560
releasing the code

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
and that means that we can't have

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,080
developers with access to

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,160
production that's actually not true with

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,039
SARS B Oxley not true at all but because

110
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,680
somebody believes it is you then end up

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,720
with these ideas where development and

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,520
operations is a separate

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,479
thing one of the

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,039
biggest values that we bring biggest

115
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,840
benefit that we bring to

116
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,919
organizations when we're talking about

117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,039
the devops philosophy bringing the

118
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,960
practices that help fulfill that Pro

119
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:42,720
that philosophy into

120
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,840
organizations is that ability for um

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,080
higher quality more frequent

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:54,720
delivery less friction in your ability

123
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,560
to get software out the door and that

124
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,319
idea

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
that it's really it's some of it's about

126
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,919
just about ownership that idea of

127
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,840
ownership if if if it's you you have an

128
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,360
idea you're going to build that idea

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,720
you're going to deploy that idea you're

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,960
going to monitor that idea and you're

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,400
responsible for the upkeep of that idea

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,759
the support and and and continued uh um

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,840
value ad of that idea and that should

134
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,120
all be within the control of a of the

135
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,400
group the team right um so

136
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,919
so IDE all the way through to deployment

137
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,360
and closing those feedback loops um

138
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,759
should be part of that story and that's

139
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,919
very difficult to do within a lot of

140
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,080
organizations so what are the steps that

141
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,680
you can do to get towards that what are

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,080
the tools that you can use to ensure

143
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,960
that you meet the compliance that you

144
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,800
need to meet right in order to continue

145
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,360
to meet your compliance but do these new

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,000
uh things and how do you maintain

147
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,560
quality right how do you maintain the

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,080
level of quality um if for example

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,160
you're not doing uat because uat is a

150
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,840
cost center not a Value Center for for

151
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,120
software engineering if if your uat is a

152
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,720
a Value Center because it finds stuff

153
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,280
and protects your business then we've

154
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,000
not got high enough quality delivery of

155
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
our product um but if we we create that

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,720
high enough quality and uat becomes a

157
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,479
cost center we want to get rid of those

158
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,080
cost centers what how do we

159
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,599
ensure um that we don't end up up with

160
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,960
um in the same situation as crowd strike

161
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,240
right um there's a great example of an

162
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,000
organization recently in the news that

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,599
caused massive disruption I think

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,240
they're going to be sued by Delta for

165
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,319
for 500 million dollars that Delta has

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
lost over the week that they had a

167
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,319
problem which which part of that is

168
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,720
their own problem with devops um but

169
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,000
what what could crowd strike have done

170
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,400
differently well they didn't one of the

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,720
things they didn't do was control the

172
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,280
blast radius right you don't just deploy

173
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,879
to production you don't just deploy to

174
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,599
100 I I'm not sure exactly how many

175
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,639
machines run at crowd strike but you

176
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,759
don't deploy to all of them at the same

177
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:20,400
time that's

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,840
Insanity uh even Windows who have very

179
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,560
high quality in the in the product that

180
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,319
they ship um they deploy to a small

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:32,000
number of people first right they

182
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:36,760
control the last radius what are are

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,360
what are our lowest impact customers or

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,560
customers that would be impacted the

185
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,000
least by an outage and deploy to them

186
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
first perhaps deploy to our own systems

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,160
first and run it for a few days see if

188
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,800
there's are any problems monitoring

189
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,680
right monitoring that that feature and

190
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,880
that capability that's being deployed

191
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,839
not deploying on a Friday the best time

192
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
to deploy is Monday morning when

193
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,399
everybody comes in because you get a

194
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,200
whole week to fix any problems deploying

195
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,640
on Friday is probably not the best idea

196
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,040
um there's all kinds of things that make

197
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:18,240
logical sense and are within the context

198
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:21,920
of this devop story that we can help um

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,079
educate uh coach and engage with your

200
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,680
team your engineers as well as with your

201
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:31,000
business and your leadership to

202
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,079
understand what these things are what

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,040
value you get from them and how you

204
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,800
maintain your ability to control risk

205
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,600
within this new world of continuous

206
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,600
delivery to production
