1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:11,760
so the question is what's the one thing

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,139
that a pspo course focuses uh forces you

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,880
to focus on

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:21,779
um and that is 100 value it forces you

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,220
to think about what is value for your

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,519
organization

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,439
what different types of things or value

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,300
because lots of people think of value as

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,220
just money in my pocket right which

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,920
isn't necessarily the only forms of

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,840
value that there is and that very much

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,020
doesn't resonate with with public

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,399
companies or or not for profits and so

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,879
what are the different types of value

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,300
that are that are that are there and

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,920
then what does value mean to us and the

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,840
interesting thing is that's that's also

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,320
not something that I can go answer for

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,820
them right this is this is product owner

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,399
being

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,020
um demonstrating leadership in their

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,879
organization is how does your

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,680
organization decide what value is and

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,600
for most organizations they have no idea

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,479
whatsoever what what value is it's

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,920
whatever that boss feels like today is

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,520
what value is

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,700
so as a product owner how do you

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,860
um Define and decide what value is help

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,220
Express that inside of the organization

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,159
help communicate that and really become

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,080
a a product manager right you're

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,860
managing that product

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:35,220
um with a huge focus on on value

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,280
um and that value is the most important

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,380
focus of the product owner class
