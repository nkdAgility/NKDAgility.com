So the question is what's the one thing that a PSPO course focuses, uh, forces you to focus on? 

And that is 100% value. It forces you to think about what is value for your organisation. 

What different types of things or value? Because lots of people think of value as just money in my pocket, right? Which isn't necessarily the only forms of value that there is. And that very much doesn't resonate with public companies or not-for-profits. 

So what are the different types of value that are there? And then what does value mean to us? 

And the interesting thing is that's also not something that I can go answer for them, right? This is product owner being, um, demonstrating leadership in their organisation. 

How does your organisation decide what value is? And for most organisations, they have no idea whatsoever what value is. It's whatever that boss feels like today is what value is. 

So as a product owner, how do you, um, define and decide what value is? Help express that inside of the organisation, help communicate that, and really become a product manager, right? You're managing that product, um, with a huge focus on value. 

And that value is the most important focus of the product owner class.
