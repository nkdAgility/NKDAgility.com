# What is the one thing a PSPO course forces you to focus on?

The #PSPO or #professionalscrumproductowner course is designed to provide you with the knowledge, skills, and capabilities you need to be a #productowner within a #scrum environment.

The #productowner acts like a CEO of the product and their intense focus on value, quality, and customer satisfaction ensures that the #scrumteam is uber focused on delivering value.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what the PSPO course focuses on most intensely.
