In my journey through the world of Agile, I've often encountered a troubling phenomenon that I like to call one of the seven signs of the Agile apocalypse: judgment. This isn't just a passing concern; it's a pervasive issue that can undermine the very principles of agility we strive to uphold. 

### The Many Faces of Judgment

Judgment can manifest in various forms, often cloaked in the guise of rules and metrics that teams feel compelled to follow. Here are some common examples:

- **Velocity Metrics**: Teams are often judged based on their velocity, which can lead to unhealthy competition and stress. If your velocity doesn't meet someone else's expectations, it can create a sense of failure.
  
- **Bug Counts**: The number of bugs in your code can become a point of contention. Teams may feel judged for having too many bugs, which can stifle innovation and risk-taking.

- **Code Volume**: Whether you’re writing too many or too few lines of code, there’s often someone ready to pass judgment. This can lead to a focus on quantity over quality, which is counterproductive.

These judgments can have a profound impact on team dynamics, fostering an environment of fear rather than one of collaboration and growth.

### The Importance of Goals and Metrics

To navigate this landscape, it’s crucial to set clear goals and create metrics that genuinely reflect progress towards those goals. However, we must remain vigilant. If the metrics we establish lead to negative behaviours—such as fear of failure or a lack of innovation—it's time to reassess and adapt them. 

Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Focus on Outcomes, Not Outputs**: Shift your attention from merely counting lines of code or bugs to understanding the value delivered to the customer. This can help align the team’s efforts with the broader goals of the organisation.

- **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Create a culture where team members feel safe discussing challenges and setbacks without fear of judgment. This openness can lead to more effective problem-solving and innovation.

- **Iterate on Metrics**: Just as we iterate on our products, we should also iterate on our metrics. Regularly review and adjust them to ensure they support a positive and productive team environment.

### Moving Forward

As we continue to embrace Agile methodologies, let’s be mindful of the judgments we impose—both on ourselves and on our teams. By fostering a culture of support and understanding, we can mitigate the negative impacts of judgment and create an environment where agility can truly thrive.
