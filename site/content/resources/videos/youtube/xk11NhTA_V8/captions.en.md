One of the seven signs of the agile apocalypse is judgment. Judgment manifests in many forms. Usually, it manifests as rules that you need to follow, and you are judged for not following them. You're judged for not having the velocity that somebody else wants. You're judged for having too many bugs. You're judged for writing too many lines of code than they would like or not enough lines of code. These are all judgments, and those judgments have an impact on the team. 

You need to set goals and create metrics that help you monitor progress towards those goals. When those metrics create negative behaviours in people, you need to adapt the metrics to make sure you're making progress towards those goals.
