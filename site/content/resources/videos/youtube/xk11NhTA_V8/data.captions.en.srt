00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,480
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:09,320
apocalypse is Judgment judgment

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,240
manifests in many forms usually it

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,799
manifests as rules that you need to

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,119
follow and you are judged for not

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,320
following them you're judged for not

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,199
having the velocity that somebody else

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,880
wants you're judged uh for having too

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,760
many bugs you're judged for writing too

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,359
many lines of code than they would like

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,559
or not enough lines of code these are

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,399
all judgments and those judgments have

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:41,160
an impact on the team you need to set

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,320
goals and create metrics that help you

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,079
monitor progress towards those goals and

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,719
when those metrics create negative

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,280
behaviors in people you need to adapt

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,120
the metrics to make sure you're making

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,079
