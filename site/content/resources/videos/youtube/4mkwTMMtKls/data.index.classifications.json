    "reasoning": "The content addresses authentic Agile adoption, customization, and the risks of copying popular models. It emphasizes autonomy, positive culture, and customer focus but does not mention or discuss autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or any agentic delivery principles. The closest match is a general encouragement of team autonomy but without technological, architectural, or agent-driven framing. No modern agentic software delivery topics (CI/CD, observability, agent interaction, governance) are present. Audience is Agile practitioners, which partially overlaps but not specifically with agentic delivery stakeholders.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content does not address Agentic Software Delivery: no AI agents, context-aware automation, or agentic systems discussed. Focus is solely on authentic, tailored Agile practices and values without reference to technological agency.",
    "level": "Ignored"
