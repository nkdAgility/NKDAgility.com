1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,280
one of the seven deadly sins of agile is

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:19,640
envy and for me I think

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,840
Envy in agile looks like um just copying

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,680
other people's stuff right that's one of

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,359
the the the ways it

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,000
manifests that um we we we believe we

7
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,520
maybe believe that if somebody else is

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,160
getting success with something then of

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,559
course we will get success with

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,160
something and the difficulty is that

11
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,920
that's not necessarily true at all um

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,800
and it I'm going to rephrase that it

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,360
might be it might be it might be

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,239
possible on the small scale right so

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,000
you're you're you're working with a with

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,199
a team um one of your colleagues another

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,440
scrum master or another product owner is

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,680
using a practice that they're like oh

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,840
this is great we do this and this and we

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,839
have this value stream and we're able to

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,439
to to get good good stuff from that and

22
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,799
you're like okay I'd like to try that

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,040
right that's that's not really what I

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:19,280
consider Envy that's just trying

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,720
stuff Envy would be um looking at a

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,400
great example of NB Spotify

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,159
model Spotify model is a fantastic

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,840
example of Envy there is no such thing

29
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,640
as the spotif model there is no such

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,600
thing uh so there was a

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,640
presentation uh and a paper uh that a

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,960
couple of folks that were were leaders

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,439
in at Spotify did at a conference uh so

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,119
I think they did a couple of conferences

35
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,159
talking

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,799
about what Spotify was

37
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,799
doing what their Journey was and where

38
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,960
they currently were on their

39
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,079
Journey right that was their their

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,000
they're telling an example of how they

41
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,959
did things and everybody went ooh the

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,920
Spotify model let's let's do that and

43
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,239
they absorb that into their you know I I

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,840
want this uh uh um this capability and

45
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,040
they go try and bring it into the

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,959
organization but what folks don't

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,239
realize is 6 weeks later Spotify were

48
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,400
doing it differently they weren't doing

49
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:32,160
what was defined in the Spotify Model A

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,920
year later they got rid of the idea of

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,519
of tribes and uh guilds and whatever

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,360
else they were doing because it it

53
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,159
didn't it didn't work for them right

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,560
they tried something and it didn't work

55
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,400
for them and that that Envy of oh

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,200
they're doing this awesome thing so we

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
need to be doing that awesome thing I

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,319
think it results in a lot of it results

59
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,640
in a lot of fomo if you've heard that

60
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,480
expression fear of missing out I think

61
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,840
that's kind of part of of envy other

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,799
people are getting stuff and you want

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,640
the same

64
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,280
stuff and that's where at many levels

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,239
organizations fail so they fail at the

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:20,360
the the the process level right because

67
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,799
you you look at um a a a Spotify model

68
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,440
or you look at safe or you look at any

69
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,159
of those big uh uh uh models and say I I

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,720
want that I want to install that in my

71
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,080
organization and then you pay lots of

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,560
money to get it installed and then

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
wonder why you know you're not getting

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,599
the benefit uh there's the the

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,200
application Level um I talked about this

76
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,920
recently on a on a podcast um that the

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,200
installing an application that enshrines

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,799
somebody else's business processes into

79
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,200
your organization is not necessarily

80
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,840
going to be successful for you right so

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,879
the example I used before was um sap

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,360
right sap is a a massive application

83
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:07,159
tool very common in our industry but if

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,159
you if you adopt a sap tool right sap

85
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,879
comes with a bunch of different

86
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,000
capabilities so let's say it's let's say

87
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,840
it's invoice processing let's say it's

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,959
invoice processing right sap has a

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,400
workflow for invoice processing that

90
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,840
comes out of the box it has certain ways

91
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,199
that it does things and you're giving up

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,000
the way your organization does things in

93
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,320
order to adopt the way sap does things

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,320
does that kind of make sense that like

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,759
there are some things that you can adapt

96
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,560
in sap but only within the bounds of

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,320
what the developers that created it

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,360
allow which means that when you see some

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,800
of your

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,919
competitors um perhaps installing sap

101
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,919
and building their whole procurement

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,560
processes in sap you think oh we need to

103
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,280
do that if they're doing that we need to

104
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,240
do that or if our competitors are adding

105
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,479
these features to our product we need to

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,560
add those features to our product and

107
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,639
that that's that's that's following

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,800
that's Envy right that's following not

109
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,240
building your own path uh Simon syak

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,080
does a great video uh that is on this

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,960
topic and he talks about the the the the

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,960
why you know start with why and he talks

113
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,479
about going to two uh conferences one's

114
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,800
a Microsoft conference under Balmer uh

115
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,840
and one's a Apple conference and at the

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Microsoft conference everybody wanted to

117
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,080
know what their competitors were doing

118
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,440
what are their competitors doing what

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,759
are their competitors saying uh uh what

120
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
are they what are they launching what

121
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,800
features do they have at the Apple

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
conference they didn't give a crap about

123
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
what the competitors were doing they're

124
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,080
like this is the way we're going we're

125
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,680
doing this CU it fits within our belief

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,120
model generos yes generosity Comfort

127
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:02,199
confidence contentedness friendliness

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,199
Goodwill kindness benevolence friendship

129
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,440
those are the the Opposites of of of

130
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,400
envy and I think that that if you can

131
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,400
put

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:17,080
aside what everybody else is doing and

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:20,759
focus on what do you need to do and what

134
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,000
do your customers need um you'll have a

135
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,160
lot better time both in the process

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,479
space in the in the tool space and in

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,120
your organizational structure space
