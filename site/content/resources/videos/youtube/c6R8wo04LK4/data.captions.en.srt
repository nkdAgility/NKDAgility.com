1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,540
the hardest part of adopting scrum is

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,320
the inherent belief in magic in

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,840
organizations the magic that things will

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,660
just work out without any practice or

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,480
effort or change that doing the same

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,900
thing over and over again won't result

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,840
in the same outcome that belief in Magic

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,660
belief that we can have a person working

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,439
on five different projects at once and

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,660
still be successful it's just ridiculous

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,739
stuff like that that is the hardest part

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,739
of scrum
