1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
until I hit the button it's continued

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,150
are you sure you understand or anyway

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:12,719

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,529
don't believe that they can hear us oh

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:22,590
yeah well because the bit that's live

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,039
with the red box is what they can see in

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,039
here

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,210
that is the that is that is your day

10
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:33,980
yeah

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:37,670
and they can hear us but they can only

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,640
see the screen they can't hear us we can

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,150
positive hear us and I'm gonna make a

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,930
start

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,760
well you mean you make your face fake

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,730

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,440

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,550
Wow well um welcome everyone that was

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120
Martin and I doing a little bit of gonna

22
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:04,339
figure out exactly what was going on so

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,230
thanks for joining us this evening in

24
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:12,200
the last of our mates closing eight what

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:14,659
has been an excellent month over June in

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,460
really cool and actually this evening as

27
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,830
you have noticed for doing a little

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,730
experiment and we are trying something

29
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,100
slightly different

30
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,440
just because Martin likes teams and he

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,400
prefers it to zoom but here I have this

32
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,190
to be all the time so yeah warm welcome

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,140
T if this is your first time thanks for

34
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,390
joining us hope you'll have a great

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,830
evening we do to probably use him as a

36
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,840
say but we're trying something different

37
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,540
tonight this is a live event easy teams

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,520
so I'm kind of forgetting my way around

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,580
the UI as well so Martin and I have been

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,680
on fun with this evening as you know for

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,290
those you've joined us before we do over

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,630
call the conduct in short we ask that

43
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,700
you are respectful to one another you

44
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,190
want everybody to have a harassment the

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,100
experience we will do the usual

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:04,480
community show types at the end in terms

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,040
of the Q&A we have a slightly different

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,860
facility to zoom but there is a nice

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,670
little option in the top layer which is

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,610
the show Q&A which is your facility to

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,030
put questions to our speaker tonight so

52
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,670
please do use that to get your questions

53
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,190
and then I will relay them back to to

54
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,379
Martin as I've already know keep them

55
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,900
coming in maybe we can pause a couple of

56
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:33,769
points and ask the questions but it'll

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,249
be great and yet so welcome to Martin

58
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:39,170
Martin is well-known to many of us I

59
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:42,560
have known it for some years he's

60
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,410
very experienced and established scrum

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,800
the org trainer amongst other things is

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:52,010
also consultant is all stuff an agile on

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,260
DevOps space and he's also makes MVP

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,910
I've trained with him twice and had a

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,190
totally good experience on both

66
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:02,239
occasions I've also seen him speak on a

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,190
few occasions and yeah we all really

68
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,610
good debate some videos are job related

69
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:10,580
topics this evening he is going to share

70
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,610
with us his amazing talk on telling me a

71
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,830
little and I Joe be spotting out your BS

72
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,470
which I need seen the floor show it's an

73
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,360
awesome talk and I'm sure you will enjoy

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,049
it Martin welcome back to see thank you

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,970
very much

76
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:30,470
it's a foul I just sum up for for for

77
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,799
staff a little bit of gistic s--

78
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,560
logistics I can't even speak and this is

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,560
not our normal teams meeting is this is

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,510
something called a team's live event I

81
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,370
think it used to be called Skype

82
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,600
broadcast and it's been rolled into

83
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:51,440
teams and we have kind of a weird

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:54,170
producer set up here going on where we

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,350
control what you can see which is

86
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,690
different from zooms or just a normal

87
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,390
team's meeting where whoever's talking

88
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,630
is the one that gets center stage in

89
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,160
this tool we get to control it so if

90
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,560
they were you're not looking at the

91
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,260
right thing then it's either my fault or

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,049
Satpal probably mine because I'm kind of

93
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,169
the one in control and we're just trying

94
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:21,169
trying this out I took this opportunity

95
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:26,300
to try and it looks like a lot of fun so

96
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:29,330
sat knows and if you look at the Q&A I

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,880
can Thank You Craig Craig's just said

98
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,090
that I'm a little bit jumpy I'm hoping

99
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,260
that we'll iron out a little bit as we

100
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,780
go my views not jumpy but I can see that

101
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:47,180
the live view is getting a little bit

102
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:51,500
and jumpy let me those there's a stats

103
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,139
but I can see maybe our megabits thing I

104
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,489
don't know let's let's see how it

105
00:04:53,139 --> 00:05:00,559
and we will look at the Sapphire if you

106
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,789
look at the QA you'll see that there's

107
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:04,549
new comments

108
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:08,209
there's published comments and there's

109
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:10,849
dismissed comments so jargon just said

110
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:13,159
good evening nobody else can see that

111
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:15,549
Jurgen said good evening until it is

112
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,049
published I just hit the publish button

113
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,789
and now everybody else can see it and we

114
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:22,389
can reply to the questions does that

115
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,389
make sense at

116
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,770
oh you're on mute sir you can't speak

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,950
when you're on mute telly - yeah I think

118
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,490
I think I got you you - I'll figure it

119
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,440
out

120
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,810
it's the school with I'm pretty

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,470
comfortable we're awesome

122
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:43,400
so let me do this which should send the

123
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:47,000
slides to you and then if I do this and

124
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,550
this and this then you should see both

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,190
me and the slides there we go

126
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:56,270
this should be an option somewhere for

127
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:58,130
folks dialing in to add subtitles as

128
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,450
well I don't know how that works

129
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:08,750
but I think I set it up with Dutch Welsh

130
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:12,650
and Spanish subtitles I think but you

131
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,960
guys can let me know whether that is

132
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:20,420
what you what you expect or is even

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,850
working so um thanks for the awesome

134
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,910
introduction Seth and as he said my name

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,430
is Martin hi - whit I obviously I'm

136
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,260
Scottish although maybe not those that

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,120
are Scottish on the call will think I am

138
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,550
not Scottish because I sound a little

139
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,260
bit American I lived in Seattle for

140
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,110
three years as a consultant so that's

141
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,420
why I sound a little bit weird but for

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,860
those that are not Scottish there will

143
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,050
be no doubt in your mind that I am

144
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,490
Scottish it's one of those weird things

145
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,650
when you're from a place people think

146
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,270
your accents weird my grandmother has

147
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,190
lived in Scotland all her life and

148
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,250
nobody in Scotland would think her

149
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,900
anything but English however she goes

150
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,920
down to England and people think she's

151
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,230
Scottish that's the fun of accents but I

152
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,150
want to talk about - really it's two

153
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,490
things but I think they're related and I

154
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,980
kind of try and tie them together one is

155
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:15,530
the tyranny of Taylorism I know there's

156
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:18,080
a lot of an agile folks that come in at

157
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,240
to this event so you'll know what I'm

158
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,000
talking about by Taylorism but I will

159
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,950
explain it for everybody else and then

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,040
talk a little bit about how to detach

161
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,920
detect when people are telling lies

162
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,470
there was a recent paper published by a

163
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,599
very large organization it was published

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:41,610
in 2018 that talks about

165
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:43,860
the things that have to be true the

166
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,490
minimum things that have to be true in

167
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,139
order for an organization a group a team

168
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,080
to say that they're agile

169
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,689
I like this list not everybody will

170
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,029
agree with it but I think it's I think

171
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,639
it's an awesome list so I wanted to

172
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:04,650
share it with you and there's a link in

173
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,439
the slides for you to access the the lie

174
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:13,169
the the actual document but you can

175
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:19,379
google for it and find it as well so let

176
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:22,439
me the first thing and that I just want

177
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,900
to caveat the situation the reason that

178
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,240
this document exists and it's from a

179
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,939
very unlikely source I'm deliberately

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,000
being obscure with that but that's that

181
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,060
80 81 percent of all development shops

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,599
worldwide say that they're agile this is

183
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:43,139
from Forrester Research so even back in

184
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:45,899
2017 eighty-one percent say that I do I

185
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:48,810
would like to assert that almost eighty

186
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,510
one percent of them are lying that's

187
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,880
what I would like to accept I think

188
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,990
they're trying to serve us a nice little

189
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,959
turd pie for our consumption and they're

190
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,990
just making it up and the reason that I

191
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,880
think apart from long experience working

192
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:10,940
with companies I'm sure a lot of you are

193
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:14,279
the same one of the reasons is that only

194
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,519
22% of those eighty-one percent that

195
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,029
were surveyed are doing short iterations

196
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,170
and by short means shorter than four

197
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:27,329
weeks four weeks are shorter so

198
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,069
obviously from our perspective or

199
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,709
depending on your your thoughts on this

200
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:34,680
that doesn't sound very very agile it

201
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:38,910
sounds a little bit long what about the

202
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:44,910
only 16% of them have an ordered backlog

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:47,760
that does not sound like I like

204
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,779
something that that that we want for our

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:56,350
agile teams or even

206
00:09:51,779 --> 00:10:00,850
at only 13 only sick I went the wrong

207
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,399
way only 13% do retrospectives if you're

208
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,430
not doing retrospectives I think

209
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,220
retrospectives are a fundamental part of

210
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,930
agility you can't really be doing say

211
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,630
that you're agile unless you're doing

212
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,190
some form of inspect and adapt unless

213
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:20,410
you have some sort of feedback loops

214
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,470
this is the source data of that you can

215
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,319
go find it online I just highlighted the

216
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:30,670
bits that I thought were important and

217
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:33,459
actually while researching for this this

218
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,220
late date the first time I was

219
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:40,690
presenting it

220
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:46,569
the-the-the I happened upon this post I

221
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:50,889
have no idea who Brian wine is but he

222
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:55,170
had a very astute thing to say and it's

223
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:57,670
really just the reality most

224
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,620
organizations while even if they look

225
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,260
awesome from the outside or not a lot of

226
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,990
fun on the insight I worked for

227
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,940
intelligent finance back in the day if

228
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:09,190
enemy remembers intelligent finance out

229
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:15,459
in Livingston yes staff pal is doing a

230
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:17,319
face I I worked for them for three that

231
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:21,250
was it five weeks I think it was five

232
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:24,670
weeks I quit after four weeks and and I

233
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:29,130
was the shortest employee ever and it

234
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,389
was just appalling the the the level of

235
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,060
just what was going on inside I just

236
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,500
could just beggar belief and that was

237
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,130
early in my career when I didn't

238
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,290
actually know better so we we've seen

239
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,980
that it's hard to change that it's

240
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,560
difficult for organizations to make make

241
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,889
this difference but I think it's worth

242
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,759
investigating a little bit on why a lot

243
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:57,250
of people attribute it to waterfall but

244
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,990
unfortunately that's only the tip of the

245
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,450
iceberg

246
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,180
Waterfall is just the start

247
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,730
of our problems it's not the source or

248
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:11,950
it's just a bit we can see at the top

249
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:14,230
and and we all have seen something that

250
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,750
looks like this requirement Center

251
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,210
design and implementation verification

252
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,400
and maintenance and this is not just

253
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:24,400
something that's applied to software

254
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,250
it's something that's applied in many

255
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,500
other different system many traditional

256
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,830
manufacturing processes traditional

257
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,720
organizational processes having

258
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,060
departments where you hand things off

259
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,770
between those departments the analogy I

260
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,960
use for the non software world is is

261
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,410
contracts signing the contract that then

262
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,870
results in work you have a salesperson

263
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,060
who convinces the customer that this is

264
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:55,390
what they want to buy and then they're

265
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,570
done they hand off that information to

266
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,490
the contracts team who then negotiate

267
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,890
the contract and they're completely

268
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,210
separate they're measured completely

269
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,790
differently and don't care about the

270
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,230
sales box they also don't care about the

271
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,110
other people don't align their only

272
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,080
concern is protecting using a contract

273
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,940
and then they hand that off to the next

274
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,160
group of people that may be involved in

275
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,110
in that process so that but at still

276
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,140
departments it's still pushing things

277
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,300
along so it's worth asking ourselves why

278
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,240
do we work that way where did this way

279
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,690
come from what we kind of need to go

280
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,010
back in time we need to go back in time

281
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:39,100
about a hundred and thirty years to the

282
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:41,950
1880s so that's got a little time travel

283
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,670
there we're now in the 1880s and just

284
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,980
before the 1880s the the world was a

285
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,860
very different place especially for

286
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,980
building products we weren't building

287
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,670
products at scale for sure so there was

288
00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:00,790
definitely that difference but also we

289
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,900
tended to build our products and work

290
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:08,350
very close to where we lived and and if

291
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,660
we had a problem we were the only ones

292
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,060
there to solve it or we got somebody in

293
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,020
to solve it and for example if you were

294
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:20,810
the cobbler making shoes

295
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:23,780
you had a mastery of what you were

296
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,900
working on so you not only were building

297
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:30,620
the whole shoe but you understood the

298
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,800
purpose of that shoe and not just of a

299
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,840
shoe because I'm sure we can all a

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,780
certain purpose of a shoe but what about

301
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,570
the specific individual for which you're

302
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:44,690
buying that I'm Pike building making

303
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,570
that shoe if you're making a shoe for a

304
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,260
farmer or making a shoe for the local

305
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,210
police officer or you're making a shoe

306
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,700
for a storekeeper there's going to be a

307
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,520
different set of requirements and if you

308
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,770
as the cobbler nor that person you have

309
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:05,060
a much bigger greater degree of a

310
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,730
connection and affinity to those things

311
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,100
so you can build a better shoe because

312
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,470
you care you care about the person you

313
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,450
understand their needs you understand

314
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,630
how their needs differ from others which

315
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:21,020
is very powerful but then the Industrial

316
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,900
Revolution came along and and a lot of

317
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,580
money was made that's you know a lot of

318
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,160
people get jobs a lot of money was made

319
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,710
people's living standards changed for

320
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,160
many people that meant increasing their

321
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:37,430
living standards and albeit that my

322
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,570
great grandmother started work in a

323
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:44,240
cotton mill at the age of 8 however

324
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:46,700
living standards did go up even if some

325
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,200
of the principles did not but if you

326
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,870
look at these pictures and ask yourself

327
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:58,820
what what does the person at each

328
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:01,940
individual station understand about the

329
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:06,050
product what it is how it's going to be

330
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,590
used who's using it do they even need

331
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:12,770
that understanding the system here in a

332
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:16,010
factory floor is set up in such a way

333
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:19,100
that you do not need that level of

334
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,370
understanding in order to to build your

335
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,960
product you're effectively Charlie from

336
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,630
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is dad

337
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,000
you're screwing the top on toothpaste

338
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,240
bottles

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,939
for a living and that that's it there's

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,209
no more there's no less than that and so

341
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:39,660
the the difference between these two is

342
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:42,279
very stark on the Left we have our

343
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,920
craftsmen taking pride in their work who

344
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,959
understands their customer works with

345
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,170
them constantly it's probably not the

346
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,819
first issue the first of that same

347
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,250
product they've built for the same

348
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:56,889
customer therefore they have a greater

349
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,689
degree of understanding and whereas the

350
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,490
the people on the right just they they

351
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,990
don't care they have no connection to

352
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,439
the customer they've got no connection

353
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:08,980
to the work apart from I get paid at the

354
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,409
end of the day and because of that only

355
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,380
connection being I get paid at the end

356
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:18,069
of the day there's a disconnect that

357
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,409
happens we disengage from the process

358
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,600
just don't care anymore that's a human

359
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:27,909
thing if we don't understand why and we

360
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,059
don't understand the context we don't

361
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:33,370
really care about the work so much so

362
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,919
this mechanization of the workplace

363
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,980
because we didn't have the technology to

364
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,780
have robots back then this mechanization

365
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,090
of the workplace we have to use people

366
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,240
instead of robots resulted in something

367
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,490
called soldiering which is a different

368
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,760
use of a word that were maybe more

369
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,820
familiar with but it really just means

370
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,960
to work more slowly than one's capacity

371
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,429
and or to loaf or malinger I don't know

372
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,260
how to translate I don't know that the

373
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:06,039
words for that in Dutch or German is

374
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,809
basically people not one thing tip to do

375
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:12,039
the work you just don't care I'm gonna

376
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:15,309
figure out how to work less so I've got

377
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:19,870
a little exercise for everybody

378
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:23,919
luckily there's a lovely URL which I

379
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:26,409
will see if I can just copy if I can

380
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,360
figure out how to get to my slide deck

381
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:33,549
while I'm looking at this is the other

382
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,110
screen and I will copy the URL I'm sure

383
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:37,030
some of you will be able to type it

384
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,630
quicker than I can copy it but we will

385
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,820
put it in the chat let's make an

386
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,670
announcement

387
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,810
you are out far

388
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:48,000
[Applause]

389
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,000
[Music]

390
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:58,200
there we go I just pasted a link into

391
00:18:53,789 --> 00:19:02,340
the Q&A if you use that link it will

392
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:05,429
open in a browser and in that browser

393
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,350
you will have this thing called mural

394
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,379
you may or may not have used it before

395
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:13,830
your up there's a few people in already

396
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:15,659
I can see folks coming in and you just

397
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,090
fine - clicking go in and anima Slee

398
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:22,529
you'll see viewers and other people's

399
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:24,960
nice Mouse mousies mice floating around

400
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:28,559
all over the place and you can zoom in

401
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,090
and zoom out uh and try not move

402
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,460
everything around let me let me just

403
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:36,539
quickly lock that I must have left it

404
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:39,929
unlocked ah look there we go that we

405
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:42,090
can't drag about the thing now and I'm

406
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:47,070
gonna give you a little exercise we're

407
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:50,249
going to and pretend that we are have

408
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:53,489
been hired by a paper mill owner to

409
00:19:50,249 --> 00:19:55,679
improve product productivity and it lost

410
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:57,720
due to people disengaging from the work

411
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,600
with the soldiery to work more slowly

412
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,090
than one's capacity I'm going to put two

413
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,570
minutes on the clock and I'm going to

414
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:09,720
ask you to create post-its for as many

415
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,369
ideas as you can now if you're wondering

416
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,769
how you create a post-it you just

417
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:16,679
double-click anywhere on the screen and

418
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:23,519
it will create a lovely post-it that you

419
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:24,239
can type in my first idea what idea

420
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,009
there we go

421
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:29,460
well part of my can't spell but that's a

422
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:31,230
separate problem what I like to do I'm

423
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,499
going to put two minutes on the clock

424
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,499
Oh

425
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,850
being two minutes are on their way and

426
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:48,080
and I'd like you to create as many ideas

427
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:50,200
as you can on that em posters for how

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,750
you could you as a management consultant

429
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,039
defeat soldiering and remember this is

430
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:00,860
this is the 1800s right there we don't

431
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:02,870
have politically correct we don't have

432
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,940
be nice to our employees because that's

433
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,059
a good thing or you'll get you'll get em

434
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,059
out heed on Twitter and we have do

435
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:15,200
whatever you want in order to facilitate

436
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:19,730
you getting the results that you need so

437
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,679
I'm hoping for as many ingenious ideas

438
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,679
as possible are you adding some soft pal

439
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,610
rushing from my own you know I I am busy

440
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,310
facilitating this event

441
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,400
doing otherwise I will not partake in

442
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,550
your exercise oh that's sad

443
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,680
I will leave our lovely attendees to do

444
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,960
that and then yeah share that amazing

445
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:47,640
ideas with you

446
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:50,070
there is about a minute left I'm going

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:58,560
to open another browser window but the

448
00:21:50,070 --> 00:22:02,850
minutes will stop counting down and oh I

449
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,580
like this so we've got gamification no

450
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,820
toilet breaks yeah that's uh that's uh

451
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:12,600
that's a good one uh or just just record

452
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:15,240
toilet breaks you have to record the

453
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,130
toilet breaks and then have some sort of

454
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,080
punishment for people that take too many

455
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:24,570
that toilet breaks paper unit by time

456
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,800
far the slowest ten percent it's

457
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,800
definitely something that can be done

458
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:35,670
bonus for hitting targets no recreation

459
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:38,250
area yeah people will tend to find the

460
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,370
recreation area if you don't if you

461
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:43,890
don't provide one but yeah shout at them

462
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:47,250
to work harder these are all fantastic

463
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,040
ideas is about five seconds left and

464
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:53,730
then I'll pull that pull that up over

465
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:58,650
here cool let me pull that up over here

466
00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:01,830
there we go so we got a lot of crazy

467
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:07,200
ideas here but really are they that

468
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:09,990
crazy I somebody I know used to work in

469
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,130
a call center and this is five or six

470
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:17,160
years ago and they had their toilet

471
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,930
breaks monitored and they got called in

472
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,350
for a meeting if they spent too much

473
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,230
time on toilet breaks it's a pretty

474
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:28,710
common in the call center industry to do

475
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:31,530
that what have we got pay by product

476
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,750
bonus for hitting targets breaking down

477
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,429
work into a series of steps that sounds

478
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,720
pretty good we need to plan all the the

479
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,270
steps

480
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,549
give them a beating if they're

481
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,740
malingering I think that's that's

482
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:46,770
definitely a good idea sack them and

483
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,890
hire new ones yeah I mean are all of our

484
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,840
workers our cogs in a machine yeah

485
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,940
they're they're not high skilled labor

486
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,070
we can train anybody to do this work so

487
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,900
if somebody's not doing the work well

488
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,740
there's 100 people waiting at the door

489
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,140
for for a job these are all really good

490
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,250
ideas

491
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:11,790
ah yes from I like that one Seth promote

492
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,760
bastards to be supervisors that is

493
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:18,090
definitely something that you would you

494
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,700
would see and in fact some of these

495
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,240
ideas that you've come up with are are

496
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,420
are fairly and fairly hit on the nose

497
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,790
let me let me jump into something here

498
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,450
there's a gentleman called Frederick

499
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:37,890
Winston Taylor he was the thought leader

500
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:43,050
at the time he was our and Craig

501
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:45,750
Cockburn of the time and he said his his

502
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:48,150
hypothesis was that hardly a competent

503
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,280
worker can be found who does not devote

504
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:53,340
a considerable amount of time to

505
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,800
studying just how slowly they can work

506
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,440
and still convinced their employer that

507
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:02,220
they're going in a good pace that I

508
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,800
think if you think about it that is the

509
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,080
fundamental basis for traditional

510
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,750
management practices your workers are

511
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,840
being nefarious they are not intent and

512
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,670
working and we need to figure out a

513
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,630
carrot and the stick how do we make them

514
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:22,370
work so he came up with this thing

515
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:26,670
called the scientific management method

516
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,560
and all of the ideas that you wrote down

517
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,870
were kinda part of his thinking he

518
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,820
developed standard methods for each job

519
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,190
break it down into a set of steps plan

520
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,760
all the work divide workers into

521
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,720
appropriate ability based groups is

522
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,250
collecting all the marketing people

523
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,020
together all the contracts people

524
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,830
together all the legal people together

525
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,360
and they're just going to do that work

526
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,310
train everybody in just the standard

527
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,000
method so we're gonna plan everything

528
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,610
that they do

529
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,920
remove thinking cuz we don't want people

530
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,260
coming up with new ideas managers are

531
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,600
smarter we're gonna tell you how to do

532
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,810
your work and then have wage incentives

533
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,620
for increased output and if that wasn't

534
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:11,860
bad enough he had a disciple called

535
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:15,820
Henry Gantt yes that Gantt

536
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,240
who came along and he created the task

537
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:22,330
and bonus system so we're still talking

538
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,790
1800s tasks and bonus system basic wage

539
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:28,240
based on expected low performance and

540
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:31,450
bonuses for exceeding excess expected

541
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,470
proficiency and give bonuses to managers

542
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,900
for motivating their staff to exceed

543
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,660
proficiency promoting bastards that's

544
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,970
exactly the outcome that's going to

545
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,770
happen there and I work for an

546
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,340
organization in Glasgow called a Greco

547
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,990
they're over in the East End of Glasgow

548
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,960
they are actually if they're a very good

549
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:56,530
company but they did have golden

550
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:03,660
handcuffs they have a 40% bonus system

551
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:07,480
they pay about 15% below the average for

552
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,690
that job in the industry and then they

553
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,390
payout up to a 40 percent bonus system

554
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,910
at the end of the year so you want to

555
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:19,990
hang around for for that bonus and you

556
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:24,790
want things to do well and something

557
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,770
else that drew my attention is that we

558
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:30,460
have this thing called the modern school

559
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:33,010
system and don't be confused by the word

560
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,990
modern I'm using modern school system as

561
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,230
an own even though I kind of forgot to

562
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:42,250
capitalize it the toward modern here but

563
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:44,470
it's unknown it's this idea that rewards

564
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,510
for fulfilled tasks everybody sits in

565
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,580
rows everybody does the same thing at

566
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,070
the same time and incentive based

567
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,340
learning and I would ask what's the

568
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,980
difference between these two pictures

569
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,940
and how you motivate people the modern

570
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:04,929
school system that most of us on the

571
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:07,960
call today and my parents the school

572
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:10,900
system that we grew up in was designed

573
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:15,700
to Train factory workers to train people

574
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:21,000
to work in factories okay these systems

575
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:28,700
were optimized for output not outcome

576
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:31,409
but it didn't stop there in 1908 Harvard

577
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,250
started why I guess it was before 1908

578
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:37,950
but 1908 was the first graduation class

579
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,110
of MBAs and you can see there's a

580
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,900
definitely a lot of white males there

581
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:45,750
but that's the MBA graduating class of

582
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,809
the time and they were taught these

583
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,030
practices taught these are the the

584
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:53,070
fundamentals from which you need to

585
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,590
build your business you need to build

586
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:58,440
your employee structure and manage

587
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:04,220
people so we ended up with hierarchical

588
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:07,200
organizations in the 1950s they started

589
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:10,110
really heavily into this idea of

590
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,539
analysis design implementation testing

591
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:18,090
and maintenance and you can see on the

592
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:20,250
right that those has new ways of saying

593
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,640
the same thing that was said in the

594
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:28,020
1800s but this is in the 1950s and then

595
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,230
the largest purchaser in the world took

596
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,270
on this concept which is the u.s. the US

597
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,929
military the US military industrial

598
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:39,360
complex is enormous you would not

599
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,500
believe how big it is I have some stats

600
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,710
in a little bit and it's just enormous

601
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,620
they took on this new way of working

602
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:52,950
they enshrined it in the way they do

603
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,620
things and it just became part of their

604
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,570
procurement processes just became part

605
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,440
of their procurement processes and it

606
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,789
became part of many other organizations

607
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,140
procurement processes at the time you

608
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:07,830
can see the folks they are building

609
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,260
clocks once it was enshrined and part of

610
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:14,700
the procurement processes it's just the

611
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:17,450
way we do things then we kind of tried

612
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,960
to apply it to software development and

613
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:25,440
things did not go very well we were

614
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,990
trying to apply management practices

615
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,940
that were designed for the predictive

616
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:34,740
world to this new empirical world where

617
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,200
the only way we figure out if

618
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,470
something can be done is by doing it we

619
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,450
can't plan everybody's work upfront so

620
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,940
hopefully most of you are already

621
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,980
familiar with these ideas moving from

622
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,650
predictive management practices over to

623
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,050
empirical management practices I don't

624
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:55,320
want to go into them all but that idea

625
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:59,160
of autonomy mastery and purpose once you

626
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,770
take money off the table for people at

627
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,290
carrot in the stick no longer works and

628
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,100
in fact has a negative impact so if you

629
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:11,250
as an individual have your extrinsic

630
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,110
motivations or your your your you have a

631
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,770
roof over your head you have food you

632
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:19,110
have a roof over your head and you have

633
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,700
those things sorted then you're not so

634
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,710
worried and you're not worried about

635
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,500
money like where's my next meal going to

636
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,080
come from then carrot and the stick

637
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,130
no longer has a positive impact if you

638
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,500
read Dan Pink's book Drive or just watch

639
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,900
the 15 minute YouTube video if you're

640
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,830
not a reader is that is that you serve

641
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,990
your reader he's nodding cool he's a

642
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,570
reader read the book it has all of the

643
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:48,660
background if you just don't care watch

644
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,460
the video and just assume that

645
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,370
everything is true but if you want the

646
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:58,020
detail you can go read the book

647
00:31:52,370 --> 00:32:01,140
so obviously this has put everybody in

648
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,580
that position of these hierarchical

649
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:08,870
organizations which we're all familiar

650
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:11,850
with departments silos and and

651
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,220
procurement practices that force us

652
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,309
towards that world and having big

653
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,850
budgets up front and these big projects

654
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:24,720
so who would be the least likely person

655
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:27,660
to understand how messed up the world

656
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,270
has become because of these things I'm

657
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,400
going to give you a hint they have a

658
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:37,410
seven hundred and thirty eight billion

659
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:39,990
dollar budget and 2.8 million employees

660
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:42,630
that's direct employees that doesn't

661
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,330
count consultants contractors and all

662
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,060
those third party people it is in fact

663
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:51,060
the US Department of Defense

664
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,670
who didn't start this mess but they

665
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,700
definitely enshrined it in all the ways

666
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,480
that we worked we made it much more

667
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,780
popular than maybe it needed to be but

668
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:07,020
they are trying to clear up their mess

669
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:10,980
what they found was that as they moved

670
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:13,740
towards agile practices they realised

671
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,820
that agile just becomes a buzzword of

672
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,920
software development and therefore all

673
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:23,460
software projects suddenly declared

674
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:27,270
themselves to be agile so they released

675
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,570
this guide called the div guide

676
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,450
detecting agile BS it was shipped out in

677
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:37,440
2018 to all of their procurement

678
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,880
officers anybody in the the US military

679
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,770
the Department of Defense who was

680
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,380
responsible for who had purchasing power

681
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:50,040
in order for them to understand what it

682
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:55,830
looks like to be agile so that they have

683
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:59,340
our litmus test to negate doing the

684
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:02,330
contract with somebody so I have one two

685
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,510
three four five six I have six questions

686
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:08,130
okay

687
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:11,130
and I usually ask folks to stand up if

688
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:14,640
I'm doing this as a big room event but

689
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:22,470
obviously you can you can't do that so

690
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:25,650
and what we are going to do is I am

691
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:28,050
going to just ask those questions what

692
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:30,390
I'd like you to do is imagine you're

693
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:34,500
standing up in your mind and I want you

694
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:37,020
to sit down in your mind friend and I

695
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,790
see something that is not true for your

696
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,020
team I'm hoping there'll be a lot more

697
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:44,910
folks standing up at the end of this

698
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,180
session that I would normally get and I

699
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:51,740
software development conference or in a

700
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:55,950
private organization okay so the first

701
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:59,100
question I have is are your teams

702
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:01,420
delivering working software to at least

703
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:05,109
some subset of real

704
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,410
users every iteration including the

705
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,420
first and gathering feedback so I'm

706
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,059
gonna caveat that a little bit I'm gonna

707
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,849
define what they mean by real users cuz

708
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:18,790
it's defined in the document real users

709
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:21,250
is production real users are people who

710
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:25,119
will be using your product and using it

711
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:27,670
in anger yeah you eighty does not count

712
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,329
as real use real users pre-production

713
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:33,250
does not count as real users some subset

714
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,070
of your users have to be used again in

715
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,940
production for this to be true

716
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:43,090
I wonder how many people sat down in

717
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:49,680
their head because if you don't have

718
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:52,930
this then it's not agile it's agile bs

719
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,290
back in question is there a product

720
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:58,960
charter that lays out the strategic

721
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,420
goals do all members of the team

722
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,150
understand and are they able to see how

723
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,030
their work contributes to that overall

724
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:12,970
success

725
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:15,610
because if not it's not agile people who

726
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:18,550
are doing the work need to understand

727
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:22,300
the whole context so that they can make

728
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:24,730
better decisions okay

729
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,370
our team is empowered to change their

730
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:29,620
processes based on what they learn I'm

731
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,660
hoping everybody who's attending here

732
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,440
would be able to say yes to that one but

733
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:39,910
if it's no it's agile bs it's not

734
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,210
agility is feedback from users turned

735
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:46,860
into concrete work items for sprint team

736
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:53,000
teams on timeline shorter than one month

737
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:55,940
if not it's not agile

738
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,240
and our teams empowered to change their

739
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,360
requirements based on feedback you've

740
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,380
got to get those that feedback

741
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,850
integrated into your system otherwise

742
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:09,020
you're still not going to build the

743
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:11,400
right thing so if not unfortunately it's

744
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:14,910
not agile

745
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,849
and then the one that I find even if I

746
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:21,059
have folks still standing up at this

747
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:23,250
point in a conference is the full

748
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:26,240
ecosystem of your project agile agile

749
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:29,400
programming teams followed by linear

750
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,799
bureaucratic deployments is a failure

751
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:39,299
it's not agile you need to have an

752
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:42,750
end-to-end process in order to see that

753
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:46,400
you're you're doing agility now while

754
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,990
this is from the Department of Defense I

755
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,690
would stand behind all of those

756
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:54,660
statements and say if you are a team

757
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,420
working in the agile space and the

758
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:03,210
answer to all of those questions is not

759
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:06,349
an absolute yes a resounding yes then

760
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:09,569
your unfortunately kidding yourself

761
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:14,190
kidding yourself on and it's not as

762
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:17,940
agile as you would like it to be this is

763
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:20,579
the diagram that is in the document you

764
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,500
can go download the detecting agile BS

765
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:26,970
if you just google detecting agile BS

766
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,020
you will get that information I think

767
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:34,430
it's awesome

768
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,430
ah so funnily enough

769
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:42,319
I used to get people coming up to me and

770
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:45,079
saying our jewels only for small

771
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:47,209
projects it doesn't work for big

772
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,199
projects that's what I used to get

773
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:52,819
probably five ten years ago now I get

774
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:54,559
people coming up and saying exactly the

775
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:57,009
opposite I'll add jewels only for large

776
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,019
projects it's not for small projects

777
00:38:57,009 --> 00:39:02,390
this data here is from the Standish

778
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:05,690
group in Boston who analyzed about

779
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,819
70,000 projects worldwide as they do a

780
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:10,609
chaos' report every year and something

781
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:13,999
they found it was the agile practices on

782
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:17,420
small projects are 32% more likely to

783
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:19,219
succeed I'm gonna define small for you

784
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,930
because their definition of small is not

785
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:25,069
the same as mine their definition of

786
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:27,890
small is 50 people or less so for me

787
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:30,920
that that that tends to be big but that

788
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:34,400
you know 50 people or less is small but

789
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,819
large projects get 600 percent more

790
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,880
likely to be successful and that's due

791
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:46,369
to the extra levels of complexity as you

792
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:53,289
add more people over 50 so if you're

793
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:57,979
moving towards your journey of agility

794
00:39:53,289 --> 00:40:00,499
is it a good idea to go look at what

795
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:02,839
everybody else is doing to get ideas on

796
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:05,599
how you might make changes and the next

797
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,430
thing you might do absolutely you should

798
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,079
be doing that you should be looking at

799
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,029
all the different practices and

800
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,089
experiences that everybody's having your

801
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:20,329
colleagues come to two sessions at the

802
00:40:14,089 --> 00:40:22,190
future of work Scotland and learn ideas

803
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:26,449
and then try them and see if they work

804
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:29,359
for you however you can't use somebody

805
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:33,949
else's process you can only be inspired

806
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:38,660
by it if you are just taking somebody

807
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:41,089
else's process and I know newer versions

808
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,119
of safe are a little bit more flexible

809
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:47,900
than they have been at the past but safe

810
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,039
was designed and built by demophoon well

811
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,829
in one

812
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:55,630
company and then used as a blueprint in

813
00:40:51,829 --> 00:41:00,289
other companies that is inherently not

814
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,269
agility it was for the first company but

815
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:04,669
then for each subsequent company after

816
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:07,160
that it's not many companies come to me

817
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:09,109
see how we're doing the Spotify model

818
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,949
and I'm kind of like what's the Spotify

819
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:15,160
model there is no such thing as the

820
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:18,529
Spotify model there was a white paper

821
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,380
written by the folks from Spotify that

822
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:24,650
talked about their point in time on

823
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:27,559
their journey towards agility their

824
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:29,599
agile evolution their continuing

825
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:30,309
evolution here's a what we're doing

826
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,829
right now

827
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:37,579
Spotify are not doing anything like

828
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:40,699
what's in their white paper anymore and

829
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,439
haven't done for a very long time it's

830
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,669
just a point in time they are on their

831
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:46,489
journey and they were just trying to

832
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:50,449
give people ideas so if you're just

833
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:53,630
installing somebody else's process you

834
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:55,369
are not being agile and and I find I

835
00:41:53,630 --> 00:42:01,249
found something really interesting

836
00:41:55,369 --> 00:42:02,809
online I found this memo this is this is

837
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:05,029
the result of the memos like a

838
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:06,349
clarifying slide but it talks about I

839
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:08,359
actually have a copy of the memo but

840
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:10,909
it's not really that interesting this

841
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:15,589
has the interesting stuff in it this is

842
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:17,929
from the the chief of a current chief of

843
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:21,890
software operations or the person who

844
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:24,999
runs IT for the US Air Force and and he

845
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:27,849
said they highly discourage discourage

846
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:31,099
their folks from using rigid

847
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:34,489
prescriptive frameworks such as safe

848
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:37,489
they point out that safe might be

849
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:39,189
potentially useful for teams who don't

850
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:43,699
have DevOps

851
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:46,579
but it will inhibit teams using DevOps

852
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:48,949
they will inhibit their ability to move

853
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:52,959
towards high degrees of agility and they

854
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:55,459
point out that safe isn't used by any

855
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:58,159
successful software commercial

856
00:42:55,459 --> 00:43:01,819
organizations if you can think of one

857
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,840
please let me know I would like to make

858
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:04,340
sure I Kathy

859
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,320
this with the correct thing we go let's

860
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,290
and smart people here at future of work

861
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,980
Scotland that have lots of experience I

862
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,380
have never seen a large successful

863
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:18,200
software commercial organization using

864
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,450
safe nor the Spotify framework well

865
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,760
apart from Spotify obviously by doing

866
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:27,190
something different now I think that's a

867
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,190
very telling piece of information

868
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:36,860
DevOps an agile are not magic magic

869
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,440
bullets they're not the thing that is

870
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:42,890
going to save the day for you

871
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,780
I thought I just put the windows flag on

872
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:48,530
the cat just for you because I know

873
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:51,880
you're always commenting on my comments

874
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,880
on on Microsoft II stuff

875
00:43:52,270 --> 00:44:00,860
we can use some of these capabilities

876
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:03,200
that we find in agility to help improve

877
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,960
our processes and practices and make

878
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,550
things a little bit better but something

879
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,460
is really important and my good friend

880
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:13,250
Russell Miller mentioned it why buy a

881
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:16,340
counterfeit when you can afford the

882
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,920
genuine article why would you go install

883
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,530
somebody else's framework that was built

884
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,630
for their culture for their

885
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,410
organizational context for their

886
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:30,470
business processes build your own every

887
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:33,200
large successful organization that has

888
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:37,010
moved towards agility has done so by

889
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:43,340
creating their own process based on

890
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:45,190
their their individual needs and how do

891
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,950
you get there one step at a time

892
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:56,960
just find the first step you can take

893
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:57,740
and take that step to get there so thank

894
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,680
you very much

895
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:03,290
I actually forgot to update that link at

896
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,350
SAC sorry about that but you will get

897
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,420
the presentation from that link if you

898
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:13,300
want to copy the slides are there any

899
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:15,210
questions that hey that do come through

900
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:20,369
Lauren I'm just

901
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:22,950
oh I okay so if it's what percent of all

902
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:25,140
team doing DSR Jared it's about energy

903
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:28,230
have the US military limited the

904
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:35,569
engagement to nineteen percent but that

905
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:38,130
is a really good question yeah so I

906
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:40,109
didn't say the US military we're doing

907
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:43,579
it well mmm

908
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:46,260
this was their they're trying to educate

909
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,640
folks inside of the organization so they

910
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,990
can see when they're making good

911
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,059
decisions and when they're making bad

912
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,770
decisions I'm sure there are

913
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:54,329
circumstances where they're between a

914
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,760
rock and a hard place and I can either

915
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,410
choose that doesn't meet the agile

916
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,970
requirements or that doesn't meet the

917
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:05,000
agile requirements and I have to pick

918
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:09,180
one so they are working closely with

919
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,369
their vendors with their their providers

920
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:18,960
to help improve agility with them but

921
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:21,290
those practices are currently required

922
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,349
by the Department of Defense's

923
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:30,329
procurement rules so technically if a

924
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:32,970
vendor is not agile not doing continuous

925
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,579
delivery is not providing them with a

926
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,670
usable increment even of a missile

927
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,770
system on a regular cadence on timeline

928
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,490
shorter than one month then they are

929
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:47,069
breaking the contract that they signed

930
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:49,200
so maybe they're not a limiting their

931
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:52,140
engagement but they can certainly sue

932
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,170
the crap out of them for not not meeting

933
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:59,970
the the requirements so that's an

934
00:46:55,170 --> 00:47:02,430
interesting one yes yes I usually did

935
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:05,579
wanna make spark a little bit of thought

936
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:08,369
I'm sure within the loop for yourself so

937
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:10,829
each new system of working solves the

938
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:14,220
problems that went before and what are

939
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:16,559
the problems are agile cancel so we can

940
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:19,349
see what might come next other than

941
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,630
maybe just doing our job properly I like

942
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:25,309
that thanks Chris I do

943
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:28,800
I like that Craig Craig always has very

944
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:31,350
very good insight and I think that it's

945
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,170
is a valid it's a valid statement to me

946
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:36,120
I I don't know if we can answer that

947
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:43,140
question because we don't know what we

948
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:46,320
don't know I guess um but I I maybe I'm

949
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,880
wrong and I'm perfectly happy for for a

950
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:52,940
creek to correct me maybe I'm wrong but

951
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:57,690
my my understanding of agility is it's

952
00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:02,040
moving from a model where things are

953
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:04,890
rigid because we have a defined world

954
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:08,430
yeah our manufacturing production line

955
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:11,280
or our building 300 houses or making

956
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:14,750
clocks on our on our factory floor and

957
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,160
we're moving from that world towards a

958
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,990
world where we need an empirical process

959
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:25,770
control system we need to be able to

960
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:28,290
adapt our reality our reality our way of

961
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:30,540
doing things to the realities that are

962
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:34,620
happening for us as a business as an

963
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:37,830
organization an agility for me just

964
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,030
means moving towards that model so that

965
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:43,320
we can accept change

966
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:47,160
so isn't agility the vehicle through

967
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,410
which we can adapt and come up with new

968
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,490
ideas for whatever's coming down in the

969
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:55,380
pipeline so I'm not I'm not sure that we

970
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,960
maybe need anything else maybe doing

971
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,630
agility properly is something we should

972
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,400
be doing but again I disagree with the

973
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:05,100
word properly I don't know about anybody

974
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,510
else but I don't think there's one way I

975
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:11,610
think saying doing agility properly is

976
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,230
kind of like what we all do say for we

977
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:15,530
all do this one thing I think it's

978
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:18,390
different for every organizational

979
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:21,630
context and everybody has to make up

980
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:25,500
their own way which means incrementally

981
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:28,350
and iteratively moving towards the

982
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:31,620
outcome that you want I think it's like

983
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:33,750
lips release its point say yeah yeah

984
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,000
justjust just well you're kind of

985
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,340
covering that bill so let's have a

986
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,390
question well then get your question of

987
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,640
sorts and the problem isn't the

988
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:42,630
Dreamworks a lot of a speaking of ugly

989
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,160
with Arnold

990
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,920
safety sebastian right and you and i

991
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,660
want that conversation many times but

992
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,150
it's the Mackenzies and the b CGS and

993
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,609
the being spitting the work the work the

994
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,230
the frameworks in because that's what

995
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:56,549
the management wants to buy right so

996
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,369
it's it's these things

997
00:49:56,549 --> 00:50:00,930
positioned and sold and nothing nuts

998
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:06,960
I've been part of that right I

999
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:09,900
I totally agree and and it it's there's

1000
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,130
not really a light at the end of there's

1001
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,990
not a light at the end of that tunnel

1002
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:18,059
they're not going to magically get it

1003
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:23,269
as as long as executive in or executives

1004
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:26,430
in organizations don't care enough to

1005
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:29,759
understand the problem they will always

1006
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:33,319
just want to buy either way into a

1007
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:36,539
solution and that's just the reality I

1008
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:41,039
firmly believe that those companies will

1009
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:45,410
not go anywhere yeah III think of it as

1010
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:48,720
it's like Darwin Darwinism animals grow

1011
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:52,380
into the niches that are available that

1012
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,680
they can optimize for and companies do

1013
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:58,829
the same companies fill a niche and if

1014
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,170
that niche changes enough then the

1015
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:04,529
company has to change if the company

1016
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:08,539
can't change they go out of business so

1017
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:12,839
those organizations that adopt change

1018
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:15,180
adopt models that allow them to adapt to

1019
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:17,849
those changing circumstances will

1020
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,710
survive and I think the world today

1021
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:24,200
changes much more quickly than it ever

1022
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:25,920
did before so they need to change true

1023
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:29,519
one step at a time

1024
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:34,079
yeah I've got one for you here which

1025
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:36,839
might clean nicely to your your your

1026
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,730
scrum and Kanban training for sure can

1027
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:41,339
you can you share what you qualify as

1028
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:44,579
the for splint so I want to get an

1029
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:45,960
astronaut discussion but what what could

1030
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:48,839
you allow you to take place before

1031
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,809
Sprint one eg new team deciding wellness

1032
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,970
research experiments understanding the

1033
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:55,619
customer flaw new offering team coming

1034
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,130
together to understand the problem and

1035
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,880
look

1036
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,560
dito eagle in the floor is yours that's

1037
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,410
a really good one I like that one so I

1038
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:11,550
don't know what what I would normally

1039
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:13,860
say it if you're at the point where you

1040
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,530
have a team because you're contemplating

1041
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,140
sprint one I'm going to make a little

1042
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:22,590
bit a bit a bit of an assumption and I'm

1043
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:25,230
going to say you've had to create you've

1044
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:28,110
had to do enough to convince somebody to

1045
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:31,890
give you some money okay

1046
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:34,590
so you have an idea about what niche

1047
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:37,650
you're trying to fill with this new

1048
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:42,900
product this new thing that you want to

1049
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:44,790
do and I would suggest just get the team

1050
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:47,280
if you have the team together with the

1051
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:50,580
product owner and decide what's the

1052
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,890
first thing that you could do what's the

1053
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,920
first thing that you could test what's

1054
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:58,560
your hypothesis if we make this product

1055
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,770
this is the behavior change that we

1056
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,510
would see this is the the measure that

1057
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:05,490
we're going to use whether we're

1058
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,890
successful what's the smallest thing

1059
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:09,510
that we can create that will meet that

1060
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,980
measure and you're trying to find

1061
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:13,830
something that's small enough that you

1062
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,660
can do it in two weeks there uh if

1063
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:18,150
you've got a team of five or six people

1064
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:22,800
there are very few things you can't have

1065
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:24,210
some basic concept of in two weeks yes

1066
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
you're gonna spend a lot of time in

1067
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:29,940
infrastructure building architecture

1068
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,280
building servers but if you're using I I

1069
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,680
work when I eat one of the classes that

1070
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:37,620
I teach is the professional scrum

1071
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,720
foundations class in the professional

1072
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,390
scrum foundations class I break

1073
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:46,530
everybody up into teams and I give them

1074
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:48,360
a backlog for it's an animal website

1075
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:52,560
right so they have to build an animal

1076
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:55,650
website so they have stories like have

1077
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,480
you been through this one Seth no so

1078
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:59,460
they have we have stories like you know

1079
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,590
it has to be generally attractive it has

1080
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,240
to have a home page it has to have these

1081
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,920
types of information and have stuff

1082
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,830
pictures and an image gallery and all

1083
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,060
these kind of things so a backlog of

1084
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,840
information and we just give the team's

1085
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,120
the backlog and we

1086
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:15,300
don't give them any instructions about

1087
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:18,840
how to go turn that into a working

1088
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:21,360
product we give them 30 minutes prints

1089
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,840
so 30 minutes of Engineering inside of

1090
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,570
the sprint and I have almost never had a

1091
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:29,070
team not be able to create something by

1092
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,620
the end of the Sprint and that's a

1093
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:34,650
30-minute sprint and I'm gonna caveat

1094
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,900
now I had one team which I was loved to

1095
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:39,630
work on this team I had one team of five

1096
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:42,120
people that by the end of the 30 minute

1097
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:44,880
the first 30-minute sprint sprint having

1098
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:47,490
never seen the requirements before and

1099
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:52,770
just picked their animal mascot for the

1100
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:54,870
team okay they managed to create using

1101
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,940
they were using visual studio they

1102
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,520
created their website in visual studio

1103
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:02,100
they had it stored in a git repository

1104
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,380
they had an automated build system

1105
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,260
created to pick up those pcs from the

1106
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:08,640
Builder from the from the git repository

1107
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,010
build it into a cohesive product and

1108
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,610
deploy it to production in Azure in 30

1109
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:14,340
minutes

1110
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:18,570
team of five people what could that

1111
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:21,300
group of people do in two weeks I think

1112
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:24,180
I think its last about what can we

1113
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,970
create but what can we create in two

1114
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,100
weeks give them the first thing and let

1115
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,270
them let them play for two weeks do you

1116
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,700
know what that gives the product owner

1117
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,350
it gives the product owner two weeks to

1118
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:38,040
go come up with the next most important

1119
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:39,860
thing just get started I think is my

1120
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:43,110
suggestion

1121
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:46,020
absolutely a really good one for you I

1122
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:49,440
love this o if you are stuck in on Jovie

1123
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:52,410
is what steps might you start take the

1124
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:57,090
model to get out of it and enjoy SBS one

1125
00:55:52,410 --> 00:56:03,180
love it depends which of the BS is your

1126
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:06,390
in I guess but so so the thing I see is

1127
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,190
the the biggest BSE is an agile apart

1128
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:10,580
from and I'm talking about a team

1129
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:14,240
there's a whole bunch of product owner

1130
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:16,080
product value be a sees that that

1131
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,890
organizations seem incapable of

1132
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:22,820
understanding value but I'm meticulous

1133
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:27,550
and if we're inside of a team

1134
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:31,100
if that team is not able to create a

1135
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:34,790
usable increment so what what the

1136
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:37,070
minimum bar for scrum is transparency we

1137
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,840
need transparency that's part of our to

1138
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,570
have an empirical process control system

1139
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,490
we need transparency the increment at

1140
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:46,040
the end of the Sprint are usable

1141
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:47,210
increment that is production-ready might

1142
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,960
not be defied production but it's

1143
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,480
production ready is the minimum bar for

1144
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,430
doing scrum if you don't have that

1145
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:58,370
you're not doing scrum yet you don't

1146
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:59,840
have transparency you've got the the

1147
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:02,360
product backlog which gives you

1148
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,150
transparency of the future you get the

1149
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,830
the the Sprint backlog which gives you

1150
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:08,330
transparency of the present and you've

1151
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:10,880
got the increment which gives you

1152
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:12,740
transparency of the past that is the

1153
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,390
whole purpose of scrum we have those

1154
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:18,050
transparency so we can see what's going

1155
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:21,380
on so I think the first one I would

1156
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:25,070
focus on is getting understanding what

1157
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:29,210
our definition of done should be versus

1158
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:31,570
what it is and every single sprint every

1159
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:34,400
single retrospective look at that death

1160
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:36,200
here's where we should be in order to

1161
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,690
create a potentially releasable

1162
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,930
shippable product here's what we can do

1163
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:45,140
hey what's the next thing we can do to

1164
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:47,270
close that cause that gap that's that's

1165
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,930
what I that's what I would start that's

1166
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:49,820
where I would start

1167
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:54,530
but then my background is engineering so

1168
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:57,140
I would start there yeah so in your

1169
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:59,300
experience for aspects of senior

1170
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,150
leadership stroke management or for

1171
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:05,510
tuned to these efforts I don't know

1172
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:09,370
really again and which are supporting

1173
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,370
them so I think that last bit screams

1174
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:17,620
the ignorant ones are thwarting us and

1175
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:20,300
the enlightened ones are enabling us

1176
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:22,250
it's really that simple there are there

1177
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:27,980
are a bunch of folks and organizations

1178
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:31,250
that don't don't understand why Fredrik

1179
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:33,200
Winston Taylor's thinking thinking's are

1180
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:35,150
a bad idea they don't understand that

1181
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,320
because that's all they've ever known

1182
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:39,410
so there

1183
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,660
looking at what you're suggesting to

1184
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:43,400
them from a position of ignorance and

1185
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:46,460
they're looking at that and they're

1186
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,350
thinking I can't operate in this world

1187
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,720
because I don't understand it

1188
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:52,610
therefore I will lose my job therefore I

1189
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,340
need to get in your way that that's

1190
00:58:52,610 --> 00:59:00,200
that's really what's happening and the

1191
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:03,770
thing that the changes that is education

1192
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:06,460
same as sorting ignorant anywhere

1193
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:11,180
whether it's government ignorant or

1194
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:15,410
people ignorant you need education that

1195
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:21,140
that's so sad pal that was definitely a

1196
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:23,930
lead-in I have a mmm professional agile

1197
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:27,170
leadership class you do I do

1198
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:28,700
just coming up on the oh well actually I

1199
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,730
think that dates wrong it's on my

1200
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:33,320
website I think I think is it the 29th

1201
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:35,960
it was good to see you hope that day

1202
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,320
strong right because that's London yeah

1203
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,630
it's not that one haha it's after that I

1204
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,820
moved it I moved it that's what it was

1205
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,740
so it's not that date it's the week

1206
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,960
after maybe I think it's the week after

1207
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,880
anyway it's on my website so you will

1208
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,230
see it there so just naked agility if

1209
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,820
you google makes agility you'll not find

1210
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:55,580
anybody else although you find some

1211
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,620
scooters there's naked scooters I don't

1212
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,530
get it but there we go and but if you

1213
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:03,340
find that class we're doing it over for

1214
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:06,440
days 8:00 a.m. till 11:30 so that

1215
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:09,590
managers can attend so that those people

1216
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,740
in leadership positions who won't turn

1217
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,510
up to a two-day class can actually turn

1218
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,360
up because you know they're finished by

1219
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:20,390
11:30 every day and I have two people

1220
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,250
signed up from Singapore so I'm with

1221
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,660
forward I'm looking forward to that

1222
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:26,120
class I just thought I'd throw that in

1223
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,400
that wasn't that's just a that's the

1224
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:30,260
sales part animal it's it's all good you

1225
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,330
were happy to do that also happy to

1226
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,660
shoot in the link to your well you

1227
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:38,360
revamped your website right not still no

1228
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:42,370
you did it for me but I did it because

1229
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:46,550
of the new normal I want a couple things

1230
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:49,370
yeah what we're doing virtual training

1231
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:53,260
now so instead of focusing

1232
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:56,660
on location we're focusing on time zone

1233
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:59,810
yeah so if I less

1234
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:02,180
i I did the first thing I thought of

1235
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:05,210
when the folks from Singapore signed up

1236
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:09,140
was our is that inside of their time

1237
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:14,140
zone and it's a two to thirty till 5:00

1238
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:19,070
p.m. for them so it makes perfect sense

1239
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:22,270
so so definitely take take regardless of

1240
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:24,710
what do you want to take it with me I

1241
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:29,030
the professional agile leadership is a

1242
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:32,270
great class not just for leadership but

1243
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:35,000
for us to help understand what

1244
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:36,710
leadership should be doing if we have to

1245
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,930
go explain to them what they should be

1246
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:42,230
doing so we talked a lot about

1247
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:45,580
delegation with which which class did

1248
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:55,840
you go through a pal sir

1249
01:01:45,580 --> 01:02:00,380
no no yeah you did our PSK come on yeah

1250
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,790
so so yeah it I I have a lot of fun

1251
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,060
teaching classes but we're doing all of

1252
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:08,660
them virtual at the moment obviously and

1253
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:11,060
I'm feeling like I like the virtual way

1254
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:15,080
of delivering a scrum that arc has found

1255
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:17,210
that there's a six percent higher pass

1256
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,940
rate for the assessments with folks

1257
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:24,890
taking the virtual classes we're not

1258
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:27,440
sure yet why that's the case but I would

1259
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:29,330
assert if you've seen my LinkedIn posts

1260
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,000
I've been posting some of the awesome

1261
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:36,050
murals that my groups have been creating

1262
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,150
in the scrum classes and oh the ability

1263
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:41,270
to create all of those things having

1264
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:44,360
those big wall exercises without having

1265
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:48,380
to fight to get access and see the wall

1266
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:50,060
is is unbelievably powerful and we PDF

1267
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:53,240
them at the end of the class everybody

1268
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:55,520
gets a copy I think that's why there's a

1269
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,250
greater degree of learning in the

1270
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,230
virtual classes even though you've got

1271
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,850
kids running about in the background and

1272
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,930
all kinds of things going on that's it's

1273
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:05,470
it's it's

1274
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:09,559
it's all good it's all part of the fun

1275
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:11,599
and I think that it's the new normal I

1276
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:12,980
think we're going to be doing virtual

1277
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,180
deliveries and working from home a lot

1278
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:20,540
more than we ever did before

1279
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:28,579
so so I had to change my website come on

1280
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:31,900
give it up second before lockdown I was

1281
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:35,420
doing a hundred and forty flights a year

1282
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:38,660
300 days a year and doing about 16

1283
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,920
different countries a year 34 countries

1284
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,710
in the last ten years

1285
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:53,510
hmm so I would prefer not to travel so

1286
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:56,119
much so a couple of and then yeah so can

1287
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:59,660
you talk a little bit about agile for

1288
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:02,300
calling each other's work yes right and

1289
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,740
perhaps the small steps are invisible to

1290
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,140
people looking obviously from the apes

1291
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:08,140
they didn't and people really say the

1292
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:11,299
ORAC you've obviously what's most the

1293
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:13,069
freezin butts off and relate to that to

1294
01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:14,480
shift your give move things forward a

1295
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:15,950
little bit closer to where they want to

1296
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,359
get right but there is a lot of that

1297
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:25,549
what's your perspective on what I think

1298
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:27,349
I think it's I we do a lot of work to

1299
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:29,569
slowly move organizations I've been

1300
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:33,920
working with a company called slumber J

1301
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:37,940
and I worked with them for four years to

1302
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:41,799
organize one team it was 600 people but

1303
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:44,270
one one product into some semblance of

1304
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:46,040
having the same source control system

1305
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:48,740
having the same work item tracking

1306
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:50,240
system just having some standards across

1307
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:54,260
their organization it took them four

1308
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:56,660
years to get there that that sometimes

1309
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:02,030
things just take a long time cultural

1310
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:04,250
change is hard but I think what is it

1311
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:06,190
it's the Cotter model that says the the

1312
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:09,829
biggest danger is declaring victory

1313
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:13,339
early if we call what we're doing agile

1314
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:17,770
and it's not we're declaring victory

1315
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:17,770
early while we've not finished the fight

1316
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,540
people get complacent and stop trying

1317
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:29,330
because all we've won so we don't have

1318
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:33,130
to do any more work I think we need to

1319
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:36,890
stop talking about transformation and

1320
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:40,400
start talking about evolution where are

1321
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:43,250
we on our agile evolution we might not

1322
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:46,280
be it we are there are are not agility

1323
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:48,700
yet or what what up what's some the this

1324
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:51,380
list that I have is just one

1325
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:54,320
organizations definition of what agility

1326
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,000
is don't don't take it and look at your

1327
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:59,570
own stuff and go while I'm not agile

1328
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,330
then you need to decide where you are on

1329
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:05,690
your journey towards agility your

1330
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:09,260
evolution and it's a continuous path

1331
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:12,680
that never ends so there will always be

1332
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:16,340
changes always be improvements I just

1333
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:21,320
like I personally like this litmus test

1334
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:23,210
of can this organization see that

1335
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:26,180
they're agile or not am I looking at

1336
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:29,000
that on their declaring victory no it's

1337
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:31,700
not true I'm gonna buy us off I'm gonna

1338
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,010
give you a bunch of money to build me a

1339
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:38,900
product and you're telling me you're

1340
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:41,270
agile how can I tell if you're lying

1341
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,099
why should I have to know why should I

1342
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:44,960
have to expect that you would be lying

1343
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:48,650
but that's what happening for

1344
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,690
organizations how many how many am I

1345
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:54,970
what's the the term consulting

1346
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:54,970
organizations like the Accenture 's the

1347
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:03,140
sultan's so those sorts of organizations

1348
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:05,869
how many of them would you consider to

1349
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:08,140
actually be agile or just effectively

1350
01:07:05,869 --> 01:07:11,180
taking the piss from their customers and

1351
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,890
saying whatever they need their cost

1352
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,770
their customer needs to hear in order to

1353
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,240
win that contract I mean that that's

1354
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:19,279
really where this focus is if you're

1355
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,410
working inside of an organization and

1356
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:24,319
you have a team and you're providing

1357
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:26,150
services this is not your litmus test

1358
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,559
this is a litmus test for an

1359
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:32,990
organization spending eight hundred more

1360
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,319
than eight hundred billion dollars on

1361
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:39,890
buying stuff yeah they need to make sure

1362
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,819
that they're they're spending the money

1363
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:45,289
effectively and their folks don't know

1364
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:46,760
whether those organizations are telling

1365
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:49,579
them the truth that's why this litmus

1366
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:52,460
test exists so don't don't definitely

1367
01:07:49,579 --> 01:07:54,650
don't use the same measure as as safe

1368
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:57,710
for the Spotify model don't don't just

1369
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:01,599
take this as route and make your own

1370
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:03,289
assessment this is just one example I

1371
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,529
don't know if that answered the question

1372
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:07,869
I tried my best

1373
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:11,029
yeah

1374
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:12,440
I could just say I'm not pooping all

1375
01:08:11,029 --> 01:08:15,950
over your attempts to make your

1376
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,259
organization more agile I'm just maybe

1377
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:23,480
pooping over saying it's agile if it's

1378
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:25,580
not that's maybe what I'm saying did you

1379
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,449
consider the space p6

1380
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:33,650
as an agile company they would feel the

1381
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:36,350
the sex question test quite like that so

1382
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:38,179
yeah yeah yeah I do programming teams

1383
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:40,130
followed by linear bureaucratic

1384
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:43,900
deployments as a failure because their

1385
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:43,900
their deploy so

1386
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:57,650
yeah I'm not I'm not gonna hold them to

1387
01:08:48,750 --> 01:09:01,920
the same if you are working within on an

1388
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:05,990
organizational context which SpaceX is

1389
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:12,120
one such an organizational context where

1390
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:13,850
it's not a possibility to to be you know

1391
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:18,480
you you don't have your rocket in space

1392
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:22,020
every 30 days but maybe they'll get

1393
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:25,080
there isn't that isn't that their plan

1394
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:26,970
like a continuous delivery of they're

1395
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,410
going to be launching on a regular

1396
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:34,170
cadence they're increasing that cadence

1397
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:39,150
I don't know maybe you could say they're

1398
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:43,410
they're still on their evolution they're

1399
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:45,840
not at this measure of agility but

1400
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:48,870
they're doing super super well at

1401
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,000
everything else so I wouldn't poop all

1402
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:53,400
over them for not booting one of these

1403
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,500
requirements if they are doing so

1404
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,450
awesome anyway if that makes sense you

1405
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:00,560
you have to look at the value deliver

1406
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:06,200
delivery in your organization it's it's

1407
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,200
agility is not the goal

1408
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:13,720
I think that's something that that folks

1409
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:16,600
often miss or misinterpret but the goal

1410
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:18,820
is not to be agile the book all this

1411
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:23,560
time an awesome business that does well

1412
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:25,950
and your customers customers needs meet

1413
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,900
your customers needs yeah I meet them

1414
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:31,240
well you want delighted customers I

1415
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:33,430
don't know the SpaceX have delighted

1416
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:35,230
customers if they do they're doing

1417
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,490
awesome I don't care what measure you

1418
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:38,560
use against them they're doing awesome

1419
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,180
if they don't have delighted customers

1420
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,840
then maybe they're doing something wrong

1421
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:49,330
I don't think it's as easy as that no no

1422
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,780
so okay we'll take a couple more than

1423
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:55,180
all other good ones coming so if you

1424
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:58,120
were to give one piece of advice to the

1425
01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:00,220
individual whose company execs is not

1426
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,740
they are agile but everywhere in the

1427
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:06,100
globe news that's not the case oh gee

1428
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:09,310
say to them I would say email that

1429
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:13,310
executive the detecting agile BS

1430
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:15,020
document just email to

1431
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:19,010
print it out leave it next to the

1432
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:24,310
executive bathrooms I don't know that

1433
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:27,440
that person that executive needs

1434
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:31,190
educated yeah they're there they have

1435
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:34,780
they're ignorant on that topic and I

1436
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:39,920
think this document makes people think

1437
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:42,340
it's its title is deliberately you know

1438
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,890
pushing that and that's why I used it in

1439
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:49,920
hey I want to make people think don't

1440
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:54,590
just assume you're agile think about it

1441
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:58,110
and I think that one piece of advice is

1442
01:11:54,590 --> 01:12:02,130
send them a link to this presentation if

1443
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:07,370
it's too if it's too long maybe I could

1444
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:09,870
do a shorter one for you yeah but

1445
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:11,040
sending them a link to the document has

1446
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:14,280
a lot more in it

1447
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:16,680
honestly I'd really recommend perusing

1448
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:18,720
this document it has lots of useful

1449
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,910
things in it it talks about DevOps it

1450
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,380
talks about continuous delivery it talks

1451
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:26,940
about feature flags it talks about

1452
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:29,070
controlled exposure to production it

1453
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:31,440
talks about a lot of things that are

1454
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:34,080
part of our new modern software

1455
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:39,050
engineering practices that we really

1456
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:44,100
should be encouraging moving towards

1457
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:46,290
blah blah blah so yeah I would

1458
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:48,270
definitely print off a copy leave it in

1459
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:51,210
the executive bathrooms that's that's

1460
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:55,260
that's definitely my recommendation and

1461
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:58,980
subtle yeah sometimes it's not subtle

1462
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:02,300
but put it on his desk when he's not

1463
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,620
there he comes back what's this thing Oh

1464
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:08,100
detecting ID you'll be a so maybe that

1465
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:10,170
oh oh [Â __Â ] well that that is I was okay

1466
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,390
well maybe maybe I need to make some

1467
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:14,670
changes maybe I need to do stuff it a

1468
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,710
lot of the time it's cuz shareholders

1469
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:18,660
are measuring organizations based on

1470
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:21,840
some of these ideas as well cuz

1471
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:24,720
shareholders don't understand they just

1472
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,010
want their money so well we know we'll

1473
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,990
get more money if this an agile

1474
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,850
organization so you should be agile so

1475
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:33,650
the CEO goes okay we're agile now that's

1476
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:33,650
the declaring declaring it

1477
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:40,920
I don't know answer but it was an answer

1478
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:44,010
this one of this one approach

1479
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,600
and I like a John's comment thank you

1480
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,260
most of my time has been adding

1481
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,540
transparency that's that's what we're

1482
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:53,570
always doing in organizations that's

1483
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,130
really the only thing that matters

1484
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:58,670
creating transparency if things are

1485
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:00,929
transparent if problems are transparent

1486
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:05,460
people will do something about them I

1487
01:14:00,929 --> 01:14:08,640
like to think of em sometimes my job is

1488
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:11,130
just to shine a torch in the dark the

1489
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,050
thing that we need to go fix and keep

1490
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,580
shining it even when people think it's

1491
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:20,730
fixed already or don't want to deal with

1492
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:22,590
it that's shine a light in the dark I'm

1493
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:25,650
gonna make this the last one I don't are

1494
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:30,510
you familiar with is it true like who

1495
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:33,420
likes loss of leadership I am NOT I know

1496
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:33,810
but know that somebody has mentioned

1497
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,350
them

1498
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:39,750
I will go google it so this is my this

1499
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:41,730
is this is my favorite thing about these

1500
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:45,989
events every week I learn something you

1501
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:47,969
how good is that so cruel acts laws of

1502
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:49,980
leadership I genuinely never I've never

1503
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:52,949
heard of them I just put it on the

1504
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:54,750
screen true like slow ship states that

1505
01:14:52,949 --> 01:14:57,300
the future of an organization is in the

1506
01:14:54,750 --> 01:15:01,020
hands of the privates in the field not

1507
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:03,929
the generals back home are quickly

1508
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,910
developing world supporting or River

1509
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:09,449
tails your leaders need to nurture yeah

1510
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:11,790
I I totally agree so I didn't know what

1511
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:13,890
it was but I totally agree with it and

1512
01:15:11,790 --> 01:15:16,469
as laws would you follow so that are

1513
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:18,590
obviously a number of them so yeah that

1514
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:22,620
definitely requires a little bit more

1515
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:25,620
digging I agree with what I just read

1516
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:27,900
that way you're nuts

1517
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:31,410
open this up to something year's evening

1518
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:33,030
so you can go research and read and

1519
01:15:31,410 --> 01:15:37,489
maybe it maybe I'll incorporate it into

1520
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:39,750
my agile leadership class yeah yeah

1521
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:43,380
States yeah okay we're gonna change

1522
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:46,020
minutes okay you feel that many

1523
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:47,699
questions even as you always do and it's

1524
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,310
been excellent and and and we learnt

1525
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:52,949
something new so that's really cool so

1526
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:54,280
just to say thanks it's great to have

1527
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:57,130
you along again

1528
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:59,590
always great talk I've seen it before

1529
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:01,030
and it's like different twist on it so

1530
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:09,489
that was pretty awesome I felt was

1531
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:10,420
slightly shorter so did you know there

1532
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:13,389
was more slice

1533
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:15,309
I don't like slides anymore how was that

1534
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:18,820
one days I'm trying to do less slides

1535
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:21,610
and more discussions and content and

1536
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:25,360
stuff I've been teaching I've always

1537
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:29,550
been a slight monkey for teaching my

1538
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:31,389
strong classes and I just taught

1539
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:34,360
professionals from foundations class

1540
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:37,030
this week with no slides at all I think

1541
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:40,449
I did cheat I copied some slides into a

1542
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:42,699
mural and but maybe only six or seven

1543
01:16:40,449 --> 01:16:44,739
things I copied I copied across I have

1544
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:46,869
the slide deck has something like three

1545
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:49,630
hundred slides in it but I did

1546
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:53,949
everything as interactive exercises from

1547
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:57,280
end to end and discussion so yeah that's

1548
01:16:53,949 --> 01:17:07,119
a lot of fun okay well Toby along thanks

1549
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:08,710
for being with us because I can't see

1550
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:10,869
anybody else I'll give me a little round

1551
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:13,030
of applause it's just very different

1552
01:17:10,869 --> 01:17:17,530
you guys did what were used to which is

1553
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:22,139
cool but ya know I would be interested

1554
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:26,530
in folks at feedback on the excuse me

1555
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:28,770
because this looks like a great tool it

1556
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:32,280
actually it actually supports up to

1557
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:34,780
20,000 participants 20,000 attendees

1558
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,090
which is a little bit more than zoom but

1559
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:39,340
maybe it's not as interactive because we

1560
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:41,650
don't have the ability for other people

1561
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,789
to mute yeah but then maybe it's better

1562
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:44,170
because you get to pick and choose the

1563
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:46,630
questions I don't know I would be

1564
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:49,210
interested in feedback pros and cons of

1565
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:51,579
it see bruising come exactly exactly

1566
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:55,150
