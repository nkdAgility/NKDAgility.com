    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses agile culture vs. superficial agile practice, critiquing Taylorism and focusing on concepts like transparency, feedback loops, and value orientation. There is no explicit or implicit discussion about autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent collaboration, or agentic delivery frameworks. No reference is made to AI, systems of work, modern engineering automation, or agent-driven feedback mechanisms, which are central to the category. The closest overlap is a general advocacy for feedback, outcome-focus, and teamwork, but these are not grounded in agentic principles. Audience is somewhat aligned (software/organizational improvement practitioners), but relevance is peripheral.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on differentiating genuine vs. superficial agile practice and critiques management philosophy, not agentic software delivery. It lacks reference to autonomous AI agents, integration, or agentic systems, so fit to the category is very low.",
    "level": "Ignored"
