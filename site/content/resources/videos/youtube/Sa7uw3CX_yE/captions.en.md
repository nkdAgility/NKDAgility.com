until I hit the button it's continued are you sure you understand or anyway yes oh cool I just started its life that's awesome I usually - right now I don't believe that they can hear us oh yeah well because the bit that's live with the red box is what they can see in here that is the that is that is your day yeah and they can hear us but they can only see the screen they can't hear us we can positive hear us and I'm gonna make a start well you mean you make your face fake yeah I don't know what you mean by big but yes and then I will hand over to you all right oh that's good oh that's me that looks like me Wow well um welcome everyone that was Martin and I doing a little bit of gonna figure out exactly what was going on so thanks for joining us this evening in the last of our mates closing eight what has been an excellent month over June in really cool and actually this evening as you have noticed for doing a little experiment and we are trying something slightly different just because Martin likes teams and he prefers it to zoom but here I have this to be all the time so yeah warm welcome T if this is your first time thanks for joining us hope you'll have a great evening we do to probably use him as a say but we're trying something different tonight this is a live event easy teams so I'm kind of forgetting my way around the UI as well so Martin and I have been on fun with this evening as you know for those you've joined us before we do over call the conduct in short we ask that you are respectful to one another you want everybody to have a harassment the experience we will do the usual community show types at the end in terms of the Q&A we have a slightly different facility to zoom but there is a nice little option in the top layer which is the show Q&A which is your facility to put questions to our speaker tonight so please do use that to get your questions and then I will relay them back to to Martin as I've already know keep them coming in maybe we can pause a couple of points and ask the questions but it'll be great and yet so welcome to Martin Martin is well-known to many of us I have known it for some years he's very experienced and established scrum the org trainer amongst other things is also consultant is all stuff an agile on DevOps space and he's also makes MVP I've trained with him twice and had a totally good experience on both occasions I've also seen him speak on a few occasions and yeah we all really good debate some videos are job related topics this evening he is going to share with us his amazing talk on telling me a little and I Joe be spotting out your BS which I need seen the floor show it's an awesome talk and I'm sure you will enjoy it Martin welcome back to see thank you very much it's a foul I just sum up for for for staff a little bit of gistic s-- logistics I can't even speak and this is not our normal teams meeting is this is something called a team's live event I think it used to be called Skype broadcast and it's been rolled into teams and we have kind of a weird producer set up here going on where we control what you can see which is different from zooms or just a normal team's meeting where whoever's talking is the one that gets center stage in this tool we get to control it so if they were you're not looking at the right thing then it's either my fault or Satpal probably mine because I'm kind of the one in control and we're just trying trying this out I took this opportunity to try and it looks like a lot of fun so sat knows and if you look at the Q&A I can Thank You Craig Craig's just said that I'm a little bit jumpy I'm hoping that we'll iron out a little bit as we go my views not jumpy but I can see that the live view is getting a little bit and jumpy let me those there's a stats but I can see maybe our megabits thing I don't know let's let's see how it and we will look at the Sapphire if you look at the QA you'll see that there's new comments there's published comments and there's dismissed comments so jargon just said good evening nobody else can see that Jurgen said good evening until it is published I just hit the publish button and now everybody else can see it and we can reply to the questions does that make sense at oh you're on mute sir you can't speak when you're on mute telly - yeah I think I got you you - I'll figure it out it's the school with I'm pretty comfortable we're awesome so let me do this which should send the slides to you and then if I do this and this and this then you should see both me and the slides there we go this should be an option somewhere for folks dialing in to add subtitles as well I don't know how that works but I think I set it up with Dutch Welsh and Spanish subtitles I think but you guys can let me know whether that is what you what you expect or is even working so um thanks for the awesome introduction Seth and as he said my name is Martin hi - whit I obviously I'm Scottish although maybe not those that are Scottish on the call will think I am not Scottish because I sound a little bit American I lived in Seattle for three years as a consultant so that's why I sound a little bit weird but for those that are not Scottish there will be no doubt in your mind that I am Scottish it's one of those weird things when you're from a place people think your accents weird my grandmother has lived in Scotland all her life and nobody in Scotland would think her anything but English however she goes down to England and people think she's Scottish that's the fun of accents but I want to talk about - really it's two things but I think they're related and I kind of try and tie them together one is the tyranny of Taylorism I know there's a lot of an agile folks that come in at to this event so you'll know what I'm talking about by Taylorism but I will explain it for everybody else and then talk a little bit about how to detach detect when people are telling lies there was a recent paper published by a very large organization it was published in 2018 that talks about the things that have to be true the minimum things that have to be true in order for an organization a group a team to say that they're agile I like this list not everybody will agree with it but I think it's I think it's an awesome list so I wanted to share it with you and there's a link in the slides for you to access the the lie the the actual document but you can google for it and find it as well so let me the first thing and that I just want to caveat the situation the reason that this document exists and it's from a very unlikely source I'm deliberately being obscure with that but that's that 80 81 percent of all development shops worldwide say that they're agile this is from Forrester Research so even back in 2017 eighty-one percent say that I do I would like to assert that almost eighty one percent of them are lying that's what I would like to accept I think they're trying to serve us a nice little turd pie for our consumption and they're just making it up and the reason that I think apart from long experience working with companies I'm sure a lot of you are the same one of the reasons is that only 22% of those eighty-one percent that were surveyed are doing short iterations and by short means shorter than four weeks four weeks are shorter so obviously from our perspective or depending on your your thoughts on this that doesn't sound very very agile it sounds a little bit long what about the only 16% of them have an ordered backlog that does not sound like I like something that that that we want for our agile teams or even at only 13 only sick I went the wrong way only 13% do retrospectives if you're not doing retrospectives I think retrospectives are a fundamental part of agility you can't really be doing say that you're agile unless you're doing some form of inspect and adapt unless you have some sort of feedback loops this is the source data of that you can go find it online I just highlighted the bits that I thought were important and actually while researching for this this late date the first time I was presenting it the-the-the I happened upon this post I have no idea who Brian wine is but he had a very astute thing to say and it's really just the reality most organizations while even if they look awesome from the outside or not a lot of fun on the insight I worked for intelligent finance back in the day if enemy remembers intelligent finance out in Livingston yes staff pal is doing a face I I worked for them for three that was it five weeks I think it was five weeks I quit after four weeks and and I was the shortest employee ever and it was just appalling the the the level of just what was going on inside I just could just beggar belief and that was early in my career when I didn't actually know better so we we've seen that it's hard to change that it's difficult for organizations to make make this difference but I think it's worth investigating a little bit on why a lot of people attribute it to waterfall but unfortunately that's only the tip of the iceberg Waterfall is just the start of our problems it's not the source or it's just a bit we can see at the top and and we all have seen something that looks like this requirement Center design and implementation verification and maintenance and this is not just something that's applied to software it's something that's applied in many other different system many traditional manufacturing processes traditional organizational processes having departments where you hand things off between those departments the analogy I use for the non software world is is contracts signing the contract that then results in work you have a salesperson who convinces the customer that this is what they want to buy and then they're done they hand off that information to the contracts team who then negotiate the contract and they're completely separate they're measured completely differently and don't care about the sales box they also don't care about the other people don't align their only concern is protecting using a contract and then they hand that off to the next group of people that may be involved in in that process so that but at still departments it's still pushing things along so it's worth asking ourselves why do we work that way where did this way come from what we kind of need to go back in time we need to go back in time about a hundred and thirty years to the 1880s so that's got a little time travel there we're now in the 1880s and just before the 1880s the the world was a very different place especially for building products we weren't building products at scale for sure so there was definitely that difference but also we tended to build our products and work very close to where we lived and and if we had a problem we were the only ones there to solve it or we got somebody in to solve it and for example if you were the cobbler making shoes you had a mastery of what you were working on so you not only were building the whole shoe but you understood the purpose of that shoe and not just of a shoe because I'm sure we can all a certain purpose of a shoe but what about the specific individual for which you're buying that I'm Pike building making that shoe if you're making a shoe for a farmer or making a shoe for the local police officer or you're making a shoe for a storekeeper there's going to be a different set of requirements and if you as the cobbler nor that person you have a much bigger greater degree of a connection and affinity to those things so you can build a better shoe because you care you care about the person you understand their needs you understand how their needs differ from others which is very powerful but then the Industrial Revolution came along and and a lot of money was made that's you know a lot of people get jobs a lot of money was made people's living standards changed for many people that meant increasing their living standards and albeit that my great grandmother started work in a cotton mill at the age of 8 however living standards did go up even if some of the principles did not but if you look at these pictures and ask yourself what what does the person at each individual station understand about the product what it is how it's going to be used who's using it do they even need that understanding the system here in a factory floor is set up in such a way that you do not need that level of understanding in order to to build your product you're effectively Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is dad you're screwing the top on toothpaste bottles for a living and that that's it there's no more there's no less than that and so the the difference between these two is very stark on the Left we have our craftsmen taking pride in their work who understands their customer works with them constantly it's probably not the first issue the first of that same product they've built for the same customer therefore they have a greater degree of understanding and whereas the people on the right just they they don't care they have no connection to the customer they've got no connection to the work apart from I get paid at the end of the day and because of that only connection being I get paid at the end of the day there's a disconnect that happens we disengage from the process just don't care anymore that's a human thing if we don't understand why and we don't understand the context we don't really care about the work so much so this mechanization of the workplace because we didn't have the technology to have robots back then this mechanization of the workplace we have to use people instead of robots resulted in something called soldiering which is a different use of a word that were maybe more familiar with but it really just means to work more slowly than one's capacity and or to loaf or malinger I don't know how to translate I don't know that the words for that in Dutch or German is basically people not one thing tip to do the work you just don't care I'm gonna figure out how to work less so I've got a little exercise for everybody luckily there's a lovely URL which I will see if I can just copy if I can figure out how to get to my slide deck while I'm looking at this is the other screen and I will copy the URL I'm sure some of you will be able to type it quicker than I can copy it but we will put it in the chat let's make an announcement you are out far [Applause] there we go I just pasted a link into the Q&A if you use that link it will open in a browser and in that browser you will have this thing called mural you may or may not have used it before your up there's a few people in already I can see folks coming in and you just fine - clicking go in and anima Slee you'll see viewers and other people's nice Mouse mousies mice floating around all over the place and you can zoom in and zoom out uh and try not move everything around let me let me just quickly lock that I must have left it unlocked ah look there we go that we can't drag about the thing now and I'm gonna give you a little exercise we're going to and pretend that we are have been hired by a paper mill owner to improve product productivity and it lost due to people disengaging from the work with the soldiery to work more slowly than one's capacity I'm going to put two minutes on the clock and I'm going to ask you to create post-its for as many ideas as you can now if you're wondering how you create a post-it you just double-click anywhere on the screen and it will create a lovely post-it that you can type in my first idea what idea there we go well part of my can't spell but that's a separate problem what I like to do I'm going to put two minutes on the clock Oh being two minutes are on their way and and I'd like you to create as many ideas as you can on that em posters for how you could you as a management consultant defeat soldiering and remember this is the 1800s right there we don't have politically correct we don't have be nice to our employees because that's a good thing or you'll get you'll get em out heed on Twitter and we have do whatever you want in order to facilitate you getting the results that you need so I'm hoping for as many ingenious ideas as possible are you adding some soft pal rushing from my own you know I I am busy facilitating this event doing otherwise I will not partake in your exercise oh that's sad I will leave our lovely attendees to do that and then yeah share that amazing ideas with you there is about a minute left I'm going to open another browser window but the minutes will stop counting down and oh I like this so we've got gamification no toilet breaks yeah that's uh that's uh that's a good one uh or just just record toilet breaks you have to record the toilet breaks and then have some sort of punishment for people that take too many that toilet breaks paper unit by time far the slowest ten percent it's definitely something that can be done bonus for hitting targets no recreation area yeah people will tend to find the recreation area if you don't if you don't provide one but yeah shout at them to work harder these are all fantastic ideas is about five seconds left and then I'll pull that pull that up over here cool let me pull that up over here there we go so we got a lot of crazy ideas here but really are they that crazy I somebody I know used to work in a call center and this is five or six years ago and they had their toilet breaks monitored and they got called in for a meeting if they spent too much time on toilet breaks it's a pretty common in the call center industry to do that what have we got pay by product bonus for hitting targets breaking down work into a series of steps that sounds pretty good we need to plan all the the steps give them a beating if they're malingering I think that's that's definitely a good idea sack them and hire new ones yeah I mean are all of our workers our cogs in a machine yeah they're they're not high skilled labor we can train anybody to do this work so if somebody's not doing the work well there's 100 people waiting at the door for for a job these are all really good ideas ah yes from I like that one Seth promote bastards to be supervisors that is definitely something that you would you would see and in fact some of these ideas that you've come up with are are fairly and fairly hit on the nose let me let me jump into something here there's a gentleman called Frederick Winston Taylor he was the thought leader at the time he was our and Craig Cockburn of the time and he said his his hypothesis was that hardly a competent worker can be found who does not devote a considerable amount of time to studying just how slowly they can work and still convinced their employer that they're going in a good pace that I think if you think about it that is the fundamental basis for traditional management practices your workers are being nefarious they are not intent and working and we need to figure out a carrot and the stick how do we make them work so he came up with this thing called the scientific management method and all of the ideas that you wrote down were kinda part of his thinking he developed standard methods for each job break it down into a set of steps plan all the work divide workers into appropriate ability based groups is collecting all the marketing people together all the contracts people together all the legal people together and they're just going to do that work train everybody in just the standard method so we're gonna plan everything that they do remove thinking cuz we don't want people coming up with new ideas managers are smarter we're gonna tell you how to do your work and then have wage incentives for increased output and if that wasn't bad enough he had a disciple called Henry Gantt yes that Gantt who came along and he created the task and bonus system so we're still talking 1800s tasks and bonus system basic wage based on expected low performance and bonuses for exceeding excess expected proficiency and give bonuses to managers for motivating their staff to exceed proficiency promoting bastards that's exactly the outcome that's going to happen there and I work for an organization in Glasgow called a Greco they're over in the East End of Glasgow they are actually if they're a very good company but they did have golden handcuffs they have a 40% bonus system they pay about 15% below the average for that job in the industry and then they payout up to a 40 percent bonus system at the end of the year so you want to hang around for for that bonus and you want things to do well and something else that drew my attention is that we have this thing called the modern school system and don't be confused by the word modern I'm using modern school system as an own even though I kind of forgot to capitalize it the toward modern here but it's unknown it's this idea that rewards for fulfilled tasks everybody sits in rows everybody does the same thing at the same time and incentive based learning and I would ask what's the difference between these two pictures and how you motivate people the modern school system that most of us on the call today and my parents the school system that we grew up in was designed to Train factory workers to train people to work in factories okay these systems were optimized for output not outcome but it didn't stop there in 1908 Harvard started why I guess it was before 1908 but 1908 was the first graduation class of MBAs and you can see there's a definitely a lot of white males there but that's the MBA graduating class of the time and they were taught these practices taught these are the the fundamentals from which you need to build your business you need to build your employee structure and manage people so we ended up with hierarchical organizations in the 1950s they started really heavily into this idea of analysis design implementation testing and maintenance and you can see on the right that those has new ways of saying the same thing that was said in the 1800s but this is in the 1950s and then the largest purchaser in the world took on this concept which is the u.s. the US military the US military industrial complex is enormous you would not believe how big it is I have some stats in a little bit and it's just enormous they took on this new way of working they enshrined it in the way they do things and it just became part of their procurement processes just became part of their procurement processes and it became part of many other organizations procurement processes at the time you can see the folks they are building clocks once it was enshrined and part of the procurement processes it's just the way we do things then we kind of tried to apply it to software development and things did not go very well we were trying to apply management practices that were designed for the predictive world to this new empirical world where the only way we figure out if something can be done is by doing it we can't plan everybody's work upfront so hopefully most of you are already familiar with these ideas moving from predictive management practices over to empirical management practices I don't want to go into them all but that idea of autonomy mastery and purpose once you take money off the table for people at carrot in the stick no longer works and in fact has a negative impact so if you as an individual have your extrinsic motivations or your your your you have a roof over your head you have food you have a roof over your head and you have those things sorted then you're not so worried and you're not worried about money like where's my next meal going to come from then carrot and the stick no longer has a positive impact if you read Dan Pink's book Drive or just watch the 15 minute YouTube video if you're not a reader is that is that you serve your reader he's nodding cool he's a reader read the book it has all of the background if you just don't care watch the video and just assume that everything is true but if you want the detail you can go read the book so obviously this has put everybody in that position of these hierarchical organizations which we're all familiar with departments silos and and procurement practices that force us towards that world and having big budgets up front and these big projects so who would be the least likely person to understand how messed up the world has become because of these things I'm going to give you a hint they have a seven hundred and thirty eight billion dollar budget and 2.8 million employees that's direct employees that doesn't count consultants contractors and all those third party people it is in fact the US Department of Defense who didn't start this mess but they definitely enshrined it in all the ways that we worked we made it much more popular than maybe it needed to be but they are trying to clear up their mess what they found was that as they moved towards agile practices they realised that agile just becomes a buzzword of software development and therefore all software projects suddenly declared themselves to be agile so they released this guide called the div guide detecting agile BS it was shipped out in 2018 to all of their procurement officers anybody in the the US military the Department of Defense who was responsible for who had purchasing power in order for them to understand what it looks like to be agile so that they have our litmus test to negate doing the contract with somebody so I have one two three four five six I have six questions okay and I usually ask folks to stand up if I'm doing this as a big room event but obviously you can you can't do that so what we are going to do is I am going to just ask those questions what I'd like you to do is imagine you're standing up in your mind and I want you to sit down in your mind friend and I see something that is not true for your team I'm hoping there'll be a lot more folks standing up at the end of this session that I would normally get and I software development conference or in a private organization okay so the first question I have is are your teams delivering working software to at least some subset of real users every iteration including the first and gathering feedback so I'm gonna caveat that a little bit I'm gonna define what they mean by real users cuz it's defined in the document real users is production real users are people who will be using your product and using it in anger yeah you eighty does not count as real use real users pre-production does not count as real users some subset of your users have to be used again in production for this to be true I wonder how many people sat down in their head because if you don't have this then it's not agile it's agile bs back in question is there a product charter that lays out the strategic goals do all members of the team understand and are they able to see how their work contributes to that overall success because if not it's not agile people who are doing the work need to understand the whole context so that they can make better decisions okay our team is empowered to change their processes based on what they learn I'm hoping everybody who's attending here would be able to say yes to that one but if it's no it's agile bs it's not agility is feedback from users turned into concrete work items for sprint team teams on timeline shorter than one month if not it's not agile and our teams empowered to change their requirements based on feedback you've got to get those that feedback integrated into your system otherwise you're still not going to build the right thing so if not unfortunately it's not agile and then the one that I find even if I have folks still standing up at this point in a conference is the full ecosystem of your project agile agile programming teams followed by linear bureaucratic deployments is a failure it's not agile you need to have an end-to-end process in order to see that you're you're doing agility now while this is from the Department of Defense I would stand behind all of those statements and say if you are a team working in the agile space and the answer to all of those questions is not an absolute yes a resounding yes then your unfortunately kidding yourself kidding yourself on and it's not as agile as you would like it to be this is the diagram that is in the document you can go download the detecting agile BS if you just google detecting agile BS you will get that information I think it's awesome ah so funnily enough I used to get people coming up to me and saying our jewels only for small projects it doesn't work for big projects that's what I used to get probably five ten years ago now I get people coming up and saying exactly the opposite I'll add jewels only for large projects it's not for small projects this data here is from the Standish group in Boston who analyzed about 70,000 projects worldwide as they do a chaos' report every year and something they found it was the agile practices on small projects are 32% more likely to succeed I'm gonna define small for you because their definition of small is not the same as mine their definition of small is 50 people or less so for me that that that tends to be big but that you know 50 people or less is small but large projects get 600 percent more likely to be successful and that's due to the extra levels of complexity as you add more people over 50 so if you're moving towards your journey of agility is it a good idea to go look at what everybody else is doing to get ideas on how you might make changes and the next thing you might do absolutely you should be doing that you should be looking at all the different practices and experiences that everybody's having your colleagues come to two sessions at the future of work Scotland and learn ideas and then try them and see if they work for you however you can't use somebody else's process you can only be inspired by it if you are just taking somebody else's process and I know newer versions of safe are a little bit more flexible than they have been at the past but safe was designed and built by demophoon well in one company and then used as a blueprint in other companies that is inherently not agility it was for the first company but then for each subsequent company after that it's not many companies come to me see how we're doing the Spotify model and I'm kind of like what's the Spotify model there is no such thing as the Spotify model there was a white paper written by the folks from Spotify that talked about their point in time on their journey towards agility their agile evolution their continuing evolution here's a what we're doing right now Spotify are not doing anything like what's in their white paper anymore and haven't done for a very long time it's just a point in time they are on their journey and they were just trying to give people ideas so if you're just installing somebody else's process you are not being agile and and I find I found something really interesting online I found this memo this is this is the result of the memos like a clarifying slide but it talks about I actually have a copy of the memo but it's not really that interesting this has the interesting stuff in it this is from the the chief of a current chief of software operations or the person who runs IT for the US Air Force and and he said they highly discourage discourage their folks from using rigid prescriptive frameworks such as safe they point out that safe might be potentially useful for teams who don't have DevOps but it will inhibit teams using DevOps they will inhibit their ability to move towards high degrees of agility and they point out that safe isn't used by any successful software commercial organizations if you can think of one please let me know I would like to make sure I Kathy this with the correct thing we go let's and smart people here at future of work Scotland that have lots of experience I have never seen a large successful software commercial organization using safe nor the Spotify framework well apart from Spotify obviously by doing something different now I think that's a very telling piece of information DevOps an agile are not magic magic bullets they're not the thing that is going to save the day for you I thought I just put the windows flag on the cat just for you because I know you're always commenting on my comments on on Microsoft II stuff we can use some of these capabilities that we find in agility to help improve our processes and practices and make things a little bit better but something is really important and my good friend Russell Miller mentioned it why buy a counterfeit when you can afford the genuine article why would you go install somebody else's framework that was built for their culture for their organizational context for their business processes build your own every large successful organization that has moved towards agility has done so by creating their own process based on their their individual needs and how do you get there one step at a time just find the first step you can take and take that step to get there so thank you very much I actually forgot to update that link at SAC sorry about that but you will get the presentation from that link if you want to copy the slides are there any questions that hey that do come through Lauren I'm just oh I okay so if it's what percent of all team doing DSR Jared it's about energy have the US military limited the engagement to nineteen percent but that is a really good question yeah so I didn't say the US military we're doing it well mmm this was their they're trying to educate folks inside of the organization so they can see when they're making good decisions and when they're making bad decisions I'm sure there are circumstances where they're between a rock and a hard place and I can either choose that doesn't meet the agile requirements or that doesn't meet the agile requirements and I have to pick one so they are working closely with their vendors with their their providers to help improve agility with them but those practices are currently required by the Department of Defense's procurement rules so technically if a vendor is not agile not doing continuous delivery is not providing them with a usable increment even of a missile system on a regular cadence on timeline shorter than one month then they are breaking the contract that they signed so maybe they're not a limiting their engagement but they can certainly sue the crap out of them for not not meeting the the requirements so that's an interesting one yes yes I usually did wanna make spark a little bit of thought I'm sure within the loop for yourself so each new system of working solves the problems that went before and what are the problems are agile cancel so we can see what might come next other than maybe just doing our job properly I like that thanks Chris I do I like that Craig Craig always has very very good insight and I think that it's is a valid it's a valid statement to me I I don't know if we can answer that question because we don't know what we don't know I guess um but I I maybe I'm wrong and I'm perfectly happy for for a creek to correct me maybe I'm wrong but my my understanding of agility is it's moving from a model where things are rigid because we have a defined world yeah our manufacturing production line or our building 300 houses or making clocks on our on our factory floor and we're moving from that world towards a world where we need an empirical process control system we need to be able to adapt our reality our reality our way of doing things to the realities that are happening for us as a business as an organization an agility for me just means moving towards that model so that we can accept change so isn't agility the vehicle through which we can adapt and come up with new ideas for whatever's coming down in the pipeline so I'm not I'm not sure that we maybe need anything else maybe doing agility properly is something we should be doing but again I disagree with the word properly I don't know about anybody else but I don't think there's one way I think saying doing agility properly is kind of like what we all do say for we all do this one thing I think it's different for every organizational context and everybody has to make up their own way which means incrementally and iteratively moving towards the outcome that you want I think it's like lips release its point say yeah yeah justjust just well you're kind of covering that bill so let's have a question well then get your question of sorts and the problem isn't the Dreamworks a lot of a speaking of ugly with Arnold safety sebastian right and you and i want that conversation many times but it's the Mackenzies and the b CGS and the being spitting the work the work the frameworks in because that's what the management wants to buy right so it's it's these things positioned and sold and nothing nuts I've been part of that right I totally agree and and it it's there's not really a light at the end of there's not a light at the end of that tunnel they're not going to magically get it as as long as executive in or executives in organizations don't care enough to understand the problem they will always just want to buy either way into a solution and that's just the reality I firmly believe that those companies will not go anywhere yeah III think of it as it's like Darwin Darwinism animals grow into the niches that are available that they can optimize for and companies do the same companies fill a niche and if that niche changes enough then the company has to change if the company can't change they go out of business so those organizations that adopt change adopt models that allow them to adapt to those changing circumstances will survive and I think the world today changes much more quickly than it ever did before so they need to change true one step at a time yeah I've got one for you here which might clean nicely to your your your scrum and Kanban training for sure can you can you share what you qualify as the for splint so I want to get an astronaut discussion but what what could you allow you to take place before Sprint one eg new team deciding wellness research experiments understanding the customer flaw new offering team coming together to understand the problem and look dito eagle in the floor is yours that's a really good one I like that one so I don't know what what I would normally say it if you're at the point where you have a team because you're contemplating sprint one I'm going to make a little bit a bit a bit of an assumption and I'm going to say you've had to create you've had to do enough to convince somebody to give you some money okay so you have an idea about what niche you're trying to fill with this new product this new thing that you want to do and I would suggest just get the team if you have the team together with the product owner and decide what's the first thing that you could do what's the first thing that you could test what's your hypothesis if we make this product this is the behavior change that we would see this is the the measure that we're going to use whether we're successful what's the smallest thing that we can create that will meet that measure and you're trying to find something that's small enough that you can do it in two weeks there uh if you've got a team of five or six people there are very few things you can't have some basic concept of in two weeks yes you're gonna spend a lot of time in infrastructure building architecture building servers but if you're using I I work when I eat one of the classes that I teach is the professional scrum foundations class in the professional scrum foundations class I break everybody up into teams and I give them a backlog for it's an animal website right so they have to build an animal website so they have stories like have you been through this one Seth no so they have we have stories like you know it has to be generally attractive it has to have a home page it has to have these types of information and have stuff pictures and an image gallery and all these kind of things so a backlog of information and we just give the team's the backlog and we don't give them any instructions about how to go turn that into a working product we give them 30 minutes prints so 30 minutes of Engineering inside of the sprint and I have almost never had a team not be able to create something by the end of the Sprint and that's a 30-minute sprint and I'm gonna caveat now I had one team which I was loved to work on this team I had one team of five people that by the end of the 30 minute the first 30-minute sprint having never seen the requirements before and just picked their animal mascot for the team okay they managed to create using they were using visual studio they created their website in visual studio they had it stored in a git repository they had an automated build system created to pick up those pcs from the Builder from the from the git repository build it into a cohesive product and deploy it to production in Azure in 30 minutes team of five people what could that group of people do in two weeks I think I think its last about what can we create but what can we create in two weeks give them the first thing and let them let them play for two weeks do you know what that gives the product owner it gives the product owner two weeks to go come up with the next most important thing just get started I think is my suggestion absolutely a really good one for you I love this o if you are stuck in on Jovie is what steps might you start take the model to get out of it and enjoy SBS one love it depends which of the BS is your in I guess but so so the thing I see is the the biggest BSE is an agile apart from and I'm talking about a team there's a whole bunch of product owner product value be a sees that that organizations seem incapable of understanding value but I'm meticulous and if we're inside of a team if that team is not able to create a usable increment so what what the minimum bar for scrum is transparency we need transparency that's part of our to have an empirical process control system we need transparency the increment at the end of the Sprint are usable increment that is production-ready might not be defied production but it's production ready is the minimum bar for doing scrum if you don't have that you're not doing scrum yet you don't have transparency you've got the the product backlog which gives you transparency of the future you get the the Sprint backlog which gives you transparency of the present and you've got the increment which gives you transparency of the past that is the whole purpose of scrum we have those transparency so we can see what's going on so I think the first one I would focus on is getting understanding what our definition of done should be versus what it is and every single sprint every single retrospective look at that death here's where we should be in order to create a potentially releasable shippable product here's what we can do hey what's the next thing we can do to close that cause that gap that's that's what I that's what I would start that's where I would start but then my background is engineering so I would start there yeah so in your experience for aspects of senior leadership stroke management or for tuned to these efforts I don't know really again and which are supporting them so I think that last bit screams the ignorant ones are thwarting us and the enlightened ones are enabling us it's really that simple there are there are a bunch of folks and organizations that don't don't understand why Fredrik Winston Taylor's thinking thinking's are a bad idea they don't understand that because that's all they've ever known so there looking at what you're suggesting to them from a position of ignorance and they're looking at that and they're thinking I can't operate in this world because I don't understand it therefore I will lose my job therefore I need to get in your way that that's that's really what's happening and the thing that the changes that is education same as sorting ignorant anywhere whether it's government ignorant or people ignorant you need education that that's so sad pal that was definitely a lead-in I have a mmm professional agile leadership class you do I do just coming up on the oh well actually I think that dates wrong it's on my website I think I think is it the 29th it was good to see you hope that day strong right because that's London yeah it's not that one haha it's after that I moved it I moved it that's what it was so it's not that date it's the week after maybe I think it's the week after anyway it's on my website so you will see it there so just naked agility if you google makes agility you'll not find anybody else although you find some scooters there's naked scooters I don't get it but there we go and but if you find that class we're doing it over for days 8:00 a.m. till 11:30 so that managers can attend so that those people in leadership positions who won't turn up to a two-day class can actually turn up because you know they're finished by 11:30 every day and I have two people signed up from Singapore so I'm with forward I'm looking forward to that class I just thought I'd throw that in that wasn't that's just a that's the sales part animal it's it's all good you were happy to do that also happy to shoot in the link to your well you revamped your website right not still no you did it for me but I did it because of the new normal I want a couple things yeah what we're doing virtual training now so instead of focusing on location we're focusing on time zone yeah so if I less I I did the first thing I thought of when the folks from Singapore signed up was our is that inside of their time zone and it's a two to thirty till 5:00 p.m. for them so it makes perfect sense so so definitely take take regardless of what do you want to take it with me I the professional agile leadership is a great class not just for leadership but for us to help understand what leadership should be doing if we have to go explain to them what they should be doing so we talked a lot about delegation with which which class did you go through a pal sir no no yeah you did our PSK come on yeah so yeah it I have a lot of fun teaching classes but we're doing all of them virtual at the moment obviously and I'm feeling like I like the virtual way of delivering a scrum that arc has found that there's a six percent higher pass rate for the assessments with folks taking the virtual classes we're not sure yet why that's the case but I would assert if you've seen my LinkedIn posts I've been posting some of the awesome murals that my groups have been creating in the scrum classes and oh the ability to create all of those things having those big wall exercises without having to fight to get access and see the wall is is unbelievably powerful and we PDF them at the end of the class everybody gets a copy I think that's why there's a greater degree of learning in the virtual classes even though you've got kids running about in the background and all kinds of things going on that's it's it's it's all good it's all part of the fun and I think that it's the new normal I think we're going to be doing virtual deliveries and working from home a lot more than we ever did before so so I had to change my website come on give it up second before lockdown I was doing a hundred and forty flights a year 300 days a year and doing about 16 different countries a year 34 countries in the last ten years hmm so I would prefer not to travel so much so a couple of and then yeah so can you talk a little bit about agile for calling each other's work yes right and perhaps the small steps are invisible to people looking obviously from the apes they didn't and people really say the ORAC you've obviously what's most the freezin butts off and relate to that to shift your give move things forward a little bit closer to where they want to get right but there is a lot of that what's your perspective on what I think I think it's I we do a lot of work to slowly move organizations I've been working with a company called slumber J and I worked with them for four years to organize one team it was 600 people but one one product into some semblance of having the same source control system having the same work item tracking system just having some standards across their organization it took them four years to get there that that sometimes things just take a long time cultural change is hard but I think what is it it's the Cotter model that says the the biggest danger is declaring victory early if we call what we're doing agile and it's not we're declaring victory early while we've not finished the fight people get complacent and stop trying because all we've won so we don't have to do any more work I think we need to stop talking about transformation and start talking about evolution where are we on our agile evolution we might not be it we are there are are not agility yet or what what up what's some the this list that I have is just one organizations definition of what agility is don't don't take it and look at your own stuff and go while I'm not agile then you need to decide where you are on your journey towards agility your evolution and it's a continuous path that never ends so there will always be changes always be improvements I just like I personally like this litmus test of can this organization see that they're agile or not am I looking at that on their declaring victory no it's not true I'm gonna buy us off I'm gonna give you a bunch of money to build me a product and you're telling me you're agile how can I tell if you're lying why should I have to know why should I have to expect that you would be lying but that's what happening for organizations how many how many am I what's the the term consulting organizations like the Accenture 's the sultan's so those sorts of organizations how many of them would you consider to actually be agile or just effectively taking the piss from their customers and saying whatever they need their cost their customer needs to hear in order to win that contract I mean that that's really where this focus is if you're working inside of an organization and you have a team and you're providing services this is not your litmus test this is a litmus test for an organization spending eight hundred more than eight hundred billion dollars on buying stuff yeah they need to make sure that they're they're spending the money effectively and their folks don't know whether those organizations are telling them the truth that's why this litmus test exists so don't don't definitely don't use the same measure as as safe for the Spotify model don't don't just take this as route and make your own assessment this is just one example I don't know if that answered the question I tried my best yeah I could just say I'm not pooping all over your attempts to make your organization more agile I'm just maybe pooping over saying it's agile if it's not that's maybe what I'm saying did you consider the space p6 as an agile company they would feel the the sex question test quite like that so yeah yeah yeah I do programming teams followed by linear bureaucratic deployments as a failure because their their deploy so yeah I'm not I'm not gonna hold them to the same if you are working within on an organizational context which SpaceX is one such an organizational context where it's not a possibility to to be you know you you don't have your rocket in space every 30 days but maybe they'll get there isn't that isn't that their plan like a continuous delivery of they're going to be launching on a regular cadence they're increasing that cadence I don't know maybe you could say they're they're still on their evolution they're not at this measure of agility but they're doing super super well at everything else so I wouldn't poop all over them for not booting one of these requirements if they are doing so awesome anyway if that makes sense you you have to look at the value deliver delivery in your organization it's it's agility is not the goal I think that's something that that folks often miss or misinterpret but the goal is not to be agile the book all this time an awesome business that does well and your customers customers needs meet your customers needs yeah I meet them well you want delighted customers I don't know the SpaceX have delighted customers if they do they're doing awesome I don't care what measure you use against them they're doing awesome if they don't have delighted customers then maybe they're doing something wrong I don't think it's as easy as that no no so okay we'll take a couple more than all other good ones coming so if you were to give one piece of advice to the individual whose company execs is not they are agile but everywhere in the globe news that's not the case oh gee say to them I would say email that executive the detecting agile BS document just email to print it out leave it next to the executive bathrooms I don't know that that person that executive needs educated yeah they're there they have they're ignorant on that topic and I think this document makes people think it's its title is deliberately you know pushing that and that's why I used it in hey I want to make people think don't just assume you're agile think about it and I think that one piece of advice is send them a link to this presentation if it's too if it's too long maybe I could do a shorter one for you yeah but sending them a link to the document has a lot more in it honestly I'd really recommend perusing this document it has lots of useful things in it it talks about DevOps it talks about continuous delivery it talks about feature flags it talks about controlled exposure to production it talks about a lot of things that are part of our new modern software engineering practices that we really should be encouraging moving towards blah blah blah so yeah I would definitely print off a copy leave it in the executive bathrooms that's that's that's definitely my recommendation and subtle yeah sometimes it's not subtle but put it on his desk when he's not there he comes back what's this thing Oh detecting ID you'll be a so maybe that oh oh [Â __Â ] well that that is I was okay well maybe maybe I need to make some changes maybe I need to do stuff it a lot of the time it's cuz shareholders are measuring organizations based on some of these ideas as well cuz shareholders don't understand they just want their money so well we know we'll get more money if this an agile organization so you should be agile so the CEO goes okay we're agile now that's the declaring declaring it I don't know answer but it was an answer this one of this one approach and I like a John's comment thank you most of my time has been adding transparency that's that's what we're always doing in organizations that's really the only thing that matters creating transparency if things are transparent if problems are transparent people will do something about them I like to think of em sometimes my job is just to shine a torch in the dark the thing that we need to go fix and keep shining it even when people think it's fixed already or don't want to deal with it that's shine a light in the dark I'm gonna make this the last one I don't are you familiar with is it true like who likes loss of leadership I am NOT I know that somebody has mentioned them I will go google it so this is my this is my favorite thing about these events every week I learn something you how good is that so cruel acts laws of leadership I genuinely never I've never heard of them I just put it on the screen true like slow ship states that the future of an organization is in the hands of the privates in the field not the generals back home are quickly developing world supporting or River tails your leaders need to nurture yeah I I totally agree so I didn't know what it was but I totally agree with it and as laws would you follow so that are obviously a number of them so yeah that definitely requires a little bit more digging I agree with what I just read that way you're nuts open this up to something year's evening so you can go research and read and maybe it maybe I'll incorporate it into my agile leadership class yeah yeah States yeah okay we're gonna change minutes okay you feel that many questions even as you always do and it's been excellent and and and we learnt something new so that's really cool so just to say thanks it's great to have you along again always great talk I've seen it before and it's like different twist on it so that was pretty awesome I felt was slightly shorter so did you know there was more slice I don't like slides anymore how was that one days I'm trying to do less slides and more discussions and content and stuff I've been teaching I've always been a slight monkey for teaching my strong classes and I just taught professionals from foundations class this week with no slides at all I think I did cheat I copied some slides into a mural and but maybe only six or seven things I copied I copied across I have the slide deck has something like three hundred slides in it but I did everything as interactive exercises from end to end and discussion so yeah that's a lot of fun okay well Toby along thanks for being with us because I can't see anybody else I'll give me a little round of applause it's just very different you guys did what were used to which is cool but ya know I would be interested in folks at feedback on the excuse me because this looks like a great tool it actually it actually supports up to 20,000 participants 20,000 attendees which is a little bit more than zoom but maybe it's not as interactive because we don't have the ability for other people to mute yeah but then maybe it's better because you get to pick and choose the questions I don't know I would be interested in feedback pros and cons of it see bruising come exactly exactly no but no thank you everyone for joining we did try this little experiment so as martin says the team and i'd be really keen to get your you know your thoughts and your feedback will always have to try things will be back to zoom next week you'll be competed so thanks for joining us keep the feedback coming and yeah that's us bringing Giunta cause I'm really excited about July we have five sessions for you as it credible there are five Wednesdays and like you believe them on so we have five events for you and we start off next week with 10-day Ricky who joins us to talk about innovation transformation this talks about intrapreneurs can drive transformation it's really cool he's just released a new book pilots in the Navy I mean cycle interesting Chuck so do tune in for that lots of interest to you and we have a whole host of other ones I'm Artemis cunningly presenting his content I was publishing one of our outstanding events for our joy which is with Steven Wendell will be joining us from the States he's also got a new book out on really cool behavioral stuff and research he doesn't really again a really insightful mass and really really good content I'm an interesting ideas support really work so yeah hope you'll join us for that community shout outs our friends that Scott this I've got their next meetup on Tuesday I believe it isn't xxx Tendo will join us on Wednesday and then our friends at Lena Joanne brought out their next event on the forests II think that's about a joke each our universe of interest sign up for that and yeah thanks again for joining us moving enjoy acoustic Martin again we'll see you again and yeah thanks and enjoy the nice Tod thank you thank you for listening everybody thank you this durian this end big red in button suck is that the one is it I can hear you know
