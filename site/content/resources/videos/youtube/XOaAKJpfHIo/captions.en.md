How important is DevOps in the continuous delivery of value to customers? Well, it's imperative that DevOps is exactly the same thing as Agile but from a different perspective. 

So the Agile piece, looking at how we work together, comes out of that view of looking at the people and how the people are working together. 

The DevOps side is coming from the perspective of, well, we've got all these cool ideas. How do we actually get them over here to the customer? How do we take the idea and actually deliver it? They're kind of part of the same capability that we're trying to achieve. 

You'll find people out there talking about DevOps and Agile as part of that story, and you'll find other people out there talking about Agile and DevOps as part of that story. I feel like they're all talking about the same thing. Any argument between that is irrelevant, and DevOps is intrinsic to Agile. It's the implementation of the same practices that we're talking about: empiricism and shortening feedback loops. 

In the technical space, DevOps has become more than that. If you had a Venn diagram, DevOps and Agile would have this massive overlap. 

I think it is absolutely imperative for teams to focus on DevOps practices, focus on that lean delivery of usable working value continuously to their customers so that they can get the feedback that they need to feed into the other processes as well to help us build the best product we possibly can for our customers. 

Because really, without getting our working product in front of our customers, we're not mitigating any risk. We're not testing our hypothesis. This is valuable, but is it actually valuable to the customer? You have to get in front of them. 

For me, those DevOps and Agile practices work intertwined together and are effectively indistinguishable from each other. Both need to be there. Obviously, if you're not working in software, DevOps is not the bit that snuggles in there for delivery. 

But if you're working in the software world, DevOps is those techniques that snuggle in along with your Agile to get that product into production.
