1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,360
how important is devops in the

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,059
continuous delivery of value to

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,799
customers well it's it's imperative

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,540
that devops

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,960
is

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,359
exactly the same thing as agile but from

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,800
a different perspective

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,539
so the agile piece uh looking at how we

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,679
work together

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,780
and comes out of that view of the the

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,120
looking at the people and how the people

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,059
are working together right

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,559
um the devops side is coming from the

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,079
perspective of

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,660
well we've got all these cool ideas how

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,879
do we actually get them over here to the

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,039
customer right how do we take the idea

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,020
and actually deliver it and they're

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,239
they're kind of part of the same

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,480
capability that we're trying to achieve

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,840
you you'll find people out there talking

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,520
about devops and agile is part of that

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,920
story and you'll find other people out

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,200
there talking about agile and devops as

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,299
part of that story right

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,659
um and I feel like they're all talking

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,680
about the same thing that any argument

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,860
between that is irrelevant and devops is

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,960
intrinsic uh to to to Agile it's the

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,420
implementation of the same practices

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,360
that we're talking about empiricism and

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,000
shortening feedback loops right

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,880
um in the technical space

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,100
um devops has become more than that

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,900
right and that's where you get that if

36
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,840
you had a Venn diagram devops and AD

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,939
you'll have this massive overlap

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,479
um so

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:50,340
I think it is absolutely

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:53,640
um imperative for teams to focus on

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,040
devops practices focus on that lean

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,619
delivery of usable working value

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,500
continuously to their customers

44
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,619
so that they can get the feedback that

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,119
they need to feed into the other

46
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,920
processes as well to help us build the

47
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,280
best product we possibly can for our

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,319
customers because really without getting

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,739
our working product in front of our

50
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,180
customers we're not we're not we're not

51
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,060
going to get there we're not mitigating

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,280
any risk we're not testing our

53
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,800
hypothesis right that we're well this is

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
valuable yeah okay but is it is it

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,920
actually valuable to the customer you

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,500
have to get in front of them so those

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,379
those for me those devops and agile

58
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,020
practices work uh intertwined together

59
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,640
are effectively indistinguishable from

60
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,680
each other

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,420
um and both need to be there obviously

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,640
if you're not working in software right

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,200
devops is not the bit you you that

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,940
snuggles in there

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,800
um for delivery

66
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,620
um but if you're working in the software

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,680
world devops is that those techniques

68
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,260
that snuggle in uh along with your agile

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,260
to get that product into into production
