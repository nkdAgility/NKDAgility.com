# How important is DevOps in continuous delivery of value to customers?

There is nothing that specifies that a #scrummaster or #agilecoach or #agileconsultant must be a #softwareengineer or #developer in order to do their job. They can be great teachers, coaches, and mentors without the deep technical knowledge that comes with #productdevelopment.

That said, you often find that the truly great #agileconsultants and #agilecoaches come from an engineering background and have deep experience in #softwaredevelopment or #devops, and have grown their coaching, mentoring, and teaching skills from that strong technical base.

So, why is #devops such a mystery to many #agilecoaches? Why is it such an imporant element of facilitating continuous delivery of value to customers? In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood provides some insights into DevOps and it's role in creating value for customers.
