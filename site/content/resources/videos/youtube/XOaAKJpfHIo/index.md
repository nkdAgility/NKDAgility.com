How important is DevOps in continuous delivery of value to customers?

**DevOps** is imperative. It is exactly the same thing as **agile**, but from a different perspective.

## Agile

The **agile** element of how we work together to achieve a shared purpose, common goal, and specific strategic objectives has a strong focus on people rather than technology.

We are focused on creating, nurturing and developing teams of people who collaborate effectively to solve compelling problems and build complex solutions.

## DevOps

The **DevOps** focus lies in delivery.

We recognize and identify that we have heaps of cool ideas, the challenge for us in **DevOps** is to figure out how to get those ideas from point A to point B.

How do we get working software, products, and features to the customer.

## Integrated solutions.

So, DevOps and Agile are part of the same capability objective that we are trying to achieve.

Both sides are focused on continuous delivery of value to customers.

You’ll find people who are evangelizing DevOps and including agile as a small part of that story. You will also find people who are evangelizing agile, and DevOps is a small part of that story.

To me, as someone who has been a practitioner, trainer, and coach in both worlds, I feel like we are all talking about the same thing. They are an integrated, interconnected part of the same solution.

**DevOps** is intrinsic to agile. It is the implementation of the same practices that we are talking about in **Agile**.

- Empiricism

- Shortening feedback loops.

- Adapting and responding to feedback and data.

DevOps has become more than just a small part of the agile story, if you had a Venn Diagram, you would see just how much DevOps and Agile overlaps to deliver a software solution to a customer.

So, for me, it is imperative for agile teams to focus on DevOps practices. Focus on LEAN delivery of working, valuable, usable software to customers.

Why?

Because we want to get feedback and data as quickly as we can. We want that feedback and data to help inform the agile product development teams on what would be the next most valuable thing they could build. What could be the most next most compelling problem to be solved.

If we aren’t getting working software to customers, quickly and effectively, we aren’t:

- Mitigating any risk.

- We aren’t testing our hypothesis.

- We aren’t getting validation that our work creates value for customers.

- We aren’t getting feedback that our work captures value for the organization.

So, in my experience and opinion, DevOps and Agile are so intertwined in the delivery of a complex solution that they are effectively indistinguishable from one another.

DevOps is incredibly important in the continuous delivery of value to customers.
