1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:13,440
so in my view uh poly immersive learning

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,340
experience has a lot of fantastic

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,880
benefits but when speaking about three

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,760
the most important ones so first one we

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,180
are in the complex world right so we

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,180
obviously don't know what we don't know

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:33,000
we have some knowledge about risks and

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,880
ambiguities what will most likely happen

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is that when you will go back to your

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,200
environment you will see oh some of the

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,140
things don't work as expected or the the

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,700
outcome is not the one that I was hoping

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,039
for so every your every assignment

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,399
brings this opportunity that you learn

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
okay it did not work you come back

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,840
so it's a fantastic learning feedback

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,020
loop because you can go back for

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,780
additional coaching feedback from the

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,560
trainer you may you may share your

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,020
findings with other participants

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,180
um and you will have some Inspirations

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:25,520
what to do when moving forward

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:30,420
uh second benefit that I can think of

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,340
is about time so as I as I already

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,740
mentioned

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,780
um I believe some of the students simply

27
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,600
need time to digest to think to reflect

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,140
it's a natural in my in my view it's a

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,420
natural feeling you simply need this

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,320
retrospective time for yourself and in

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,340
this way in immersive class way you have

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,159
regular time for reflection you have

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,759
more time for digesting the whole

34
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,219
content and this format brings you

35
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,239
regular opportunities to ask more

36
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,879
questions when you are ready

37
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,540
last but not least the problem very

38
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,000
typical for many students I'm amazed

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,599
with the class A lot of learnings a lot

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,620
of tools but I came back and well I

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,260
forgot I did not have time right and

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,900
with this format we are holding you

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:35,220
accountable we are helping you with that

44
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,920
because every every module has an

45
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,959
assignment a small experiment that you

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,900
are supposed to conduct in your

47
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,340
professional environment

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:50,040
and thanks to that you can hold yourself

49
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,980
accountable and after the whole Learning

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,560
Journey you will have a set of a few

51
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,040
maybe even several experiments conducted

52
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,920
in your professional environment it

53
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,519
might be for you a great opportunity to

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,680
create habits of experimentation and

55
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,459
learning through that in your

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,459
organization
