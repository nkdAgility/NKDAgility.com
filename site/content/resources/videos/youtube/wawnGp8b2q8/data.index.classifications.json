    "reasoning": "The content does not mention or discuss agentic software delivery or its key facets such as AI agents in delivery, contextual intelligence, or engineering practices. Its focus is on immersive learning, reflection, and feedback in professional development, which only faintly relates to feedback loops found in agentic systems. No evidence of technology, AI, or software delivery context is present. Audience may include technical professionals, but nothing is targeted specifically to those practicing or implementing agentic software delivery. The score is low due to lack of direct references, poor conceptual alignment, and minimal depth on the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content does not fit Agentic Software Delivery. It addresses immersive learning, not AI agent integration or software delivery. Any alignment is coincidental (feedback, experimentation), not specific to the category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
