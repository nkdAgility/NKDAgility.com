00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
is how do you know if you've got a great

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,580
Sprint goal

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,660

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,880
got a great Sprint goal is if both

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,260
the stakeholders

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,760

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,320

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,539
