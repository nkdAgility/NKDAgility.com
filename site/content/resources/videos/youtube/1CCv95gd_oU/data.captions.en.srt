1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,880
hey everyone hello

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,040
it's nice to be back uh working with the

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
team akaditi team thank you very much

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,320
for this opportunity

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,720
um it's a pity that thanks to

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,400
coved we're not able to be physically in

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,920
nigeria because i was looking forward to

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
that i think it's one of the few west

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,599
african countries i've not been to

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
because i've been to quite a number of

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,239
them but then hey kobe would go

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
and we would hopefully have the

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,880
opportunity

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,920
to do just that in the future

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,879
so today um i wanted to talk about

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,039
emotional intelligence or ei and team

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,280
performance because it's one of these

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,480
topics that i am quite passionate about

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,840
and i'll try my best to

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,840
um interlace it with

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,280
my experience working so far

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
in the scrum and agile space i just like

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,520
to ask

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,960
everyone to kindly go on mute

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,560
if you have any questions do note them

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,000
down and i would answer them at the end

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,119
of the session

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
because uh sadly if you're going through

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,840
the flow and you get diverted it's

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,560
a bit difficult to come back to what you

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,759
were saying

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,000
okay thank you

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
so today we'll be covering what

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
emotional intelligence is

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
then i'll take you through the five

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,240
elements of emotional

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,840
intelligence we'll then talk about

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,119
emotional intelligence and team

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,159
performance

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,119
seven ways to create an ei team

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,920
ei and scrum values and we would end

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
there so

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,320
from now i'm just going to call it ei

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,759
because emotional intelligence is quite

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,960
a mouthful so we'll start off with

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,560
talking about

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,880
uh what e.i is you know for example

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
um if one sits down and at times you

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,040
want to think about who a perfect leader

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,959
is you think of someone who

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,800
be um sort of whose temper is always

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
under control they manage their temper

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
well they have the complete

54
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,840
trust of the people they work with you

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,480
know they listen to their teams you know

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,520
they're easily approachable they're

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,160
easy to talk to and

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,760
mainly that is because um such

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,120
individuals tend to have

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,959
quite a high ei so i guess the first

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
question that comes to mind then is what

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,680
is e.i

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,920
is the ability to understand and manage

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
your own emotions and those of people

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,080
around you

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
so people with a high degree of e.i know

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,239
what they're feeling

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,360
what their emotions mean and how these

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,120
emotions can

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,200
affect other people so

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
one of the interesting things to note is

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,879
there are five main elements of

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,400
ei and at least 90 percent of top

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,480
performance have an a very high ei score

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
and simply puts their social and

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
emotional skills

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and strengths that enable you to to be

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,360
successful both

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
personally and professionally um

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
these are one of the kind of uh skills

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
that

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,159
um one is easily it's good to have

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
such skill sets if you are a leader it's

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,599
good for your career progression

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,840
and what is it really good

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
to note about that as well is the fact

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,560
that

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,000
one may not have all the skills but it's

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
something that can be

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,280
learned and it really

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,440
is something that i would recommend

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
especially in the agile space

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,720
in environments where we work with

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
people and we interact with people and

95
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,360
that tends to be

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,400
almost every role you do right

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
so i'll just

98
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
move on to talk about the five main

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,959
elements of

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
ei and uh so i'll just start from left

101
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
to right okay

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
my cursor is there so i'll be moving my

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
cursor so you know where exactly i

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,239
am um we'll start off with the first one

105
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,040
which is about oops i think that was too

106
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,359
fast

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,359
okay

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,040
than i am so the first one is

109
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,600
self-awareness

110
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,479
which is the ability to recognize and

111
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,800
understand your moods your emotions

112
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,080
and drives as well as how they affect

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,280
other people

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,479
so it's just telling you of being aware

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,440
of the way you behave you know

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,400
and uh this is very important for

117
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
example

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,720
as an individual when we get

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,160
angry being able to understand that oh

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
i've gotten to that point you know

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,320
there's that point you get through

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,919
before you

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
lose it so being able to be aware that

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,759
this is that point where i

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,360
lose it and then i'll start saying

126
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,639
really crazy things that

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,600
maybe uh later on after that

128
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,840
emotion has passed you would actually be

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,960
embarrassed of what you said

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,440
it happens to all of us and you know i

131
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,080
i am one of the people that believe that

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
words have

133
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,320
a lot of power so sometimes for example

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,400
when you get really angry you would say

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
really nasty things some people are like

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
that so being

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
self-aware especially in a work

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
environment

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
of what your trigger points are is very

140
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,199
important

141
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,320
people that tend to do that tend to have

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,440
a lot of self-confidence

143
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,240
they have a realistic self-assessment

144
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
of themselves they have a

145
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,600
self-deprecating

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,120
sense of humor and some of the things

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
you need to know is that how you're able

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,840
to sort of

149
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,319
be self-aware of who you are is maybe

150
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,319
keep in a journal because you know

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
sometimes if you keep a journal on your

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
day-to-day basis

153
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,840
when you go back to read it you'll be

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
able to

155
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
uh sort of uh read and see where your

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,680
trigger points are

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,400
um and also one of the things

158
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,880
simple as it may sound one of the other

159
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
things

160
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,600
is to just and think

161
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,600
um i think someone's uh mike is really

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,039
interfering and if that person could be

163
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,319
on mute that would be lucky

164
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,680
thank you the next thing

165
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,919
is self-regulation

166
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
that's the ability to control or

167
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
redirect

168
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,360
disruptive impulses and moods the

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,360
propensity to suspend

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,080
judgments to think before acting

171
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,639
self-awareness and self-regulation tends

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,479
to go

173
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,479
hand-in-hand in my opinion

174
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
because with that one as well it's also

175
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,840
dealing with

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:11,039
emotional control and being able

177
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,120
uh to stay calm at all times

178
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,120
people like that tend to the whole max

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,560
for that is trustworthiness and

180
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,160
integrity comfort with ambiguity

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,560
being open to change uh tips for that

182
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,120
is that for example when you make

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,280
mistakes

184
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
just own up to it don't blame others for

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,199
that know your values if you know your

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,919
values and you know what you stand for

187
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,800
you know what you wouldn't like budge on

188
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,000
and you wouldn't lose sleep over that

189
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,599
and also another good thing is practice

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,039
being calm you know for example

191
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,120
uh if you get into a situation that you

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,520
think is getting out of hand

193
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
sometimes it's just better to just walk

194
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,680
away

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
as difficult as it may sound it's not

196
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,919
every battle you need to win

197
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,160
choose your battles wisely especially in

198
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,280
a corporate environment

199
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,840
uh yeah i think those are the tips tips

200
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,879
i'd give for self-regulation

201
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,800
motivation uh being passionate it's a

202
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,240
passion to work for reasons that go

203
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
beyond money or

204
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
status it's a propensity to pursue goals

205
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,520
with energy

206
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,720
and persistence motivation is very

207
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,240
important

208
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,560
when you want to achieve your goals

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,279
especially if you're a leader it's not

210
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,279
only about

211
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,360
motivating yourself but it's also

212
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,800
motivating your team as well to achieve

213
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
the goals they have to achieve uh

214
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,440
you also need to um always be

215
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,640
um mindful or remember the reason why

216
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
you did your role

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
or your job what you enjoy about it you

218
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
know

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,320
and that kind of thing hallmarks of that

220
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
is having a strong drive

221
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,880
to achieve optimism even in the face of

222
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,399
failure organizational commitment

223
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,760
uh basically just having a

224
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,440
positive twist to everything you do you

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,480
know for example for those of us

226
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,880
in the agile space we would always say

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
that

228
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,440
failure is good i i lecture at the

229
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,120
university and when you go

230
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,480
and you tell the kids that failure is

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
good they all look at you like you

232
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,279
you've lost a few

233
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,080
screws up there and i always like to add

234
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,279
to that by

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,440
saying that it's not the failure itself

236
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,440
that you should be concentrating on

237
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,160
but it's the lesson learned and then

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,240
moving forward how you would change that

239
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
so these are the kind of things i mean

240
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,000
by being optimistic at all times because

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,640
trust me if you're negative and if you

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,880
run teams and you come in the morning

243
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
to with your team and you're actually

244
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,160
negative and you have a negative

245
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,560
outlook it impacts

246
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,720
the whole team so as a leader it's very

247
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,399
important that one you're motivated to

248
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
do your own work to set your own

249
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
personal goals

250
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,640
but two that you motivate the team

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,200
you're leading

252
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,640
to carry them on this journey whatever

253
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,920
that would be

254
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,519
um the next thing

255
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:24,240
we will talk about is empathy

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,160
for me i think empathy is big

257
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,519
it's one of the biggest ones you have to

258
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,079
have in ei as far as i'm concerned

259
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
uh it's the ability to understand the

260
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,240
emotional makeup of

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
other people it's the skill in treating

262
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,480
people according to their

263
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,720
emotional reactions and

264
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,079
this is very important when dealing with

265
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,079
other individuals

266
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,560
and working in any environments because

267
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,600
when it's like that people that tend to

268
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,440
be like that

269
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,800
need uh tend to understand people

270
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,959
from their perspectives you know some of

271
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,959
the tips i would give uh

272
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,279
being able to put yourself in other

273
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,959
people's shoes you know if someone gives

274
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,839
you a reason or

275
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,120
someone you you don't necessarily have

276
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
to always be right

277
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
people because we're different will have

278
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
a different

279
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,560
view or outlook to a particular

280
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
situation and sometimes

281
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,720
these different outlook and views

282
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,600
also help when solving an issue so

283
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
always look at something from someone's

284
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,079
perspective

285
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,000
if someone is telling you something that

286
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
is contrary to what you believe

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
always think why is the person saying

288
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
that

289
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
or telling me this you know another

290
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,000
important thing

291
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,079
in this particular with empathy is

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,320
reading body language

293
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,200
and being attentive to the way people

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,040
communicate

295
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,680
you know um

296
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
communication is not just speaking to be

297
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
honest

298
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
it's there's a lot of different other

299
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,839
forms of communication so

300
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,680
one thing i always um recommend to

301
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
people especially people who want to

302
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,440
lead

303
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,120
is studied the other the various types

304
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
of communication because you know for

305
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
example

306
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,399
if someone is talking to you and they

307
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,440
they just can't stare you in the

308
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,079
eye then you wonder if what they're

309
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
saying is

310
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
it's the truth or not you know that kind

311
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,839
of thing so it's very

312
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
important that you you you you read body

313
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,920
language

314
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,440
also another tip is um to understand

315
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,079
how others are feeling so that you'll be

316
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,399
you'll be able to work with them better

317
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,800
hallmarks of this particular trait is

318
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,160
expertise in building and retaining

319
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,040
talent

320
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
another interesting one is

321
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,600
cross-cultural sensitivity

322
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,279
cross-cultural sensitivity especially

323
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,320
in this day and age we work in

324
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,959
is a very important

325
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:10,079
thing um simple example for example

326
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,200
for even me myself um going

327
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,560
um going to ghana uh

328
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,120
for the first time and seeing uh

329
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,519
people a lot of people you know walk in

330
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,720
like men who were friends walking

331
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,399
holding hands

332
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
uh women who were friends working

333
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,959
holding hands and i was thinking oh we

334
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,320
have a lot of

335
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,720
um you know the lgbt community is quite

336
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
big

337
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,800
in ghana than it seems and i was saying

338
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,160
that to someone i said because i see a

339
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,760
lot of people holding they said no

340
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,040
they're just friends you're like oh

341
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,399
okay so you know that kind of thing

342
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,120
or for example going to

343
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,440
to to uh you know like for for those of

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,959
us

345
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,639
who've grown up in the west there's a

346
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,959
lot of um

347
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
personal space you have so you don't

348
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
want people to come

349
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
very close to you or as you start

350
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,199
feeling a bit um

351
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,040
claustrophobic almost and you you come

352
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,360
and at times people want to come talk to

353
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,680
you

354
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,000
look very close huddle next to you and

355
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
you know having to deal with that all

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,519
for example even in the first

357
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,199
work space i remember earlier on when i

358
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,199
started dealing with teams in

359
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,480
india and you call and they just pick

360
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,040
the phone and the first thing they'll

361
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
tell you

362
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,160
is yes tell me and i used to feel so

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,440
offended about it and later i realized

364
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
that's the way they talk

365
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
it's you know they're not being abrasive

366
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,320
they're not being rude

367
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,480
and that kind of thing uh i think i

368
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,320
belabor the point a little bit too long

369
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
and another interesting one is service

370
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,360
to clients and customers as well so with

371
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
empathy it's very

372
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,519
important especially if you have

373
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
customer facing roles where you have to

374
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,639
deal with clients and they're bringing

375
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,079
in complaints

376
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,760
uh not to go challenge the clients for

377
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,560
example because

378
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
um i've seen that happen in interesting

379
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
scenarios and

380
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,240
that should not be the norm i'd move to

381
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,480
the last one which is social skills

382
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
and with that one it's proficiency in

383
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
managing relationships and building

384
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
networks

385
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,360
it's an ability to find common ground

386
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,440
and build rapport

387
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,320
now for that one social skills is also a

388
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
big one

389
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
that as a leader one needs to

390
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,760
continuously develop

391
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,639
this particular skill um

392
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,160
people that have have um this particular

393
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
skill tend to be

394
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,240
good communicators they tend to be able

395
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,959
to effectively manage

396
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,720
change another big thing with that one

397
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,759
is being able to resolve

398
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,920
conflicts diplomatically so

399
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,199
the hallmarks of that which i've already

400
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,519
stated effectiveness in leading church

401
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:52,639
persuasiveness expertise in building

402
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,920
uh large uh in building and leading

403
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
teams

404
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,480
so with that one the tips i would give

405
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,959
to enhance that particular skill

406
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,920
is to learn to conflict resolution

407
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,360
um also as a leader another good thing

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,320
with that one is to

409
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,440
learn to acknowledge good work that has

410
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,519
been done by team members

411
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,680
uh so to for this particular page the

412
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,000
only other thing i would like to add to

413
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
that

414
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,800
is these elements of

415
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,560
these five elements of ei actually um

416
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,600
help you to lead to to perform better

417
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,880
it helps you to effectively

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,759
relate to members at work and it's

419
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,839
it really deals with in the bottom line

420
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,680
it really deals with one's attitude

421
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,079
towards work and towards

422
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,959
each other your relationships with

423
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,399
people

424
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,040
being aware of yourself and how you come

425
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,120
across

426
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,440
and basically self management and

427
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
this is something that with time and

428
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,639
practice

429
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,839
would actually help one be effective

430
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
in their role

431
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,559
okay so i'm going to move on to the next

432
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,079
slide where we'll talk about

433
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:18,160
ei and team performance

434
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,959
so with with ei and team performance

435
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,919
it helps with the with group group

436
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,199
collaboration

437
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,960
and creating the right environment for

438
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,400
people to work creating the right group

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
dynamics

440
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
sort of uh like personal connection for

441
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,840
purpose

442
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,240
cultural emotional connection behavior

443
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
and one thing that one should understand

444
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
that when it comes to

445
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,600
creating these in in the team dynamics

446
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
it

447
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,679
is not an easy thing to do i must

448
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,919
reiterate because

449
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,039
sometimes these things come as close as

450
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
very simplistic

451
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
but as long as we're dealing with human

452
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,559
beings

453
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,559
who happen and we all know we are all

454
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,600
complex in our right

455
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,240
we need to understand that it is not an

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
easy thing to inculcate in an

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,480
environment

458
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,200
and in a culture but it is something

459
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
that

460
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,039
helps to create high performing teams

461
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
and that it takes time so one of the

462
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,840
things you need to think about

463
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,400
is the motivations as a team leader of

464
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,960
each person on a team to contribute to

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,919
the team

466
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,559
dynamic so with that one you're talking

467
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
about

468
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,400
um influencing patterns

469
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,600
of the way people think how how they

470
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,039
react to each

471
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,880
each other how you know you also need to

472
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,840
if you have a team you also need to

473
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,559
understand each

474
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,880
individual you have in the team and in

475
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,720
so

476
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,280
doing it's important that you know what

477
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,039
motivates each person you have within

478
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,919
your team in so doing you're able to

479
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,720
create

480
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,960
the right environment where each team

481
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,400
member

482
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,360
actually contributes to ensure

483
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
growth and ensure that the common goal

484
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,000
of the organization

485
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,480
is achieved and you also need to

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,559
ensure that each person will naturally

487
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,400
naturally contribute their strengths for

488
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,400
the betterment of the team

489
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
because if you have a team you have

490
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
different individuals within the team

491
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,640
you need to understand

492
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,240
what they're good at how best they like

493
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,640
to work in a team you know like for

494
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,600
example you may have some people

495
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,760
who are a stickler for detail they would

496
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,840
have want more attention to detail so

497
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
you give them tasks that is

498
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
that relates to that you have some

499
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,679
people who

500
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,520
would may not talk a lot more but then

501
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,520
they have the way they work so being

502
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,880
able to understand how person a

503
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,919
and person b works is always good to to

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
to be able to

505
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,400
create the right environment and get the

506
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,720
best out of them to deliver

507
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,480
it's also important to deliver to

508
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,520
develop interpersonal

509
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,799
and interpersonal skills intra

510
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,440
and interpersonal skills within the team

511
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,520
um you need to create the right

512
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,120
environments where

513
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,159
team members can work with each other

514
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,080
peaceably you know it's a place that

515
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,000
you need to create an environment where

516
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,720
the team members feel

517
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
comfortable to work when you know where

518
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,080
there

519
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,799
are um there would they're bound to be

520
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
conflicts

521
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
if you work in a team because we're

522
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
individuals but it

523
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
the needs that you need to create the

524
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,120
environment as a leader where

525
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,280
these conflicts had are nipped in the

526
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,080
body they're dealt with they're handled

527
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,400
immediately not something that is swept

528
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,360
under the carpet because trust me if

529
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,360
you notice that there's something that

530
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,840
could lead to a big conflict

531
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,280
and you don't deal in with it at the

532
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,240
earliest stages

533
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,440
it would explode and sometimes if you

534
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
had dealt with that

535
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,320
earlier it will just die everything now

536
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
and everything would go on as normal but

537
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,600
if you

538
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,640
leave it and ignore it it would explode

539
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
and at times

540
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,400
spoil all the team dynamics that you

541
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,039
created what

542
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,799
hard for you know all of a sudden the

543
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
worst thing you would want is having a

544
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
team with

545
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
this is supporting person b a and that

546
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,400
is supporting person b

547
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,679
i think even we had um i think i'm gonna

548
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,440
give my age here

549
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,520
when i say i remember there was a time

550
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,039
when the black stars of ghana

551
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
yeah football we all love it when it

552
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,600
comes to world cup there was a time when

553
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,480
we had

554
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,919
team members who one person thought he

555
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,799
should have been the captain as opposed

556
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,240
to the other

557
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,799
and you had team members not uh

558
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,240
siding with one person as opposed to the

559
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,000
other that means that even when they're

560
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,720
passing the ball they would not pass the

561
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
ball to

562
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,159
someone who supported the other side in

563
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,640
so doing

564
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
you have spoiled productivity you have

565
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
spoiled everything

566
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
now if in the beginning if the coach had

567
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
just picked these two people

568
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,919
talked to them and dealt with it from

569
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,799
the get-go

570
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
that would have sorted the situation

571
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,640
straight away

572
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,720
also ensure that you assess situation

573
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
from the point of views of others

574
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,720
um this keeps coming up over and over

575
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,840
again

576
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,520
i think that is because in most times

577
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,679
when we work with people if the person

578
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,720
does not accept things from your

579
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,200
perspective

580
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,080
and from your view at times you come

581
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,799
across

582
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,200
leadership that gets quite upset with

583
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,520
such

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,440
people especially if you're deemed to be

585
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
a troublemaker or voice over

586
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,520
or very voice affairs but you actually

587
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,240
need to listen to people

588
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,039
and to listen to why their view is

589
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
different and

590
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,320
understand it because in so you as an

591
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,320
individual also learns a lot

592
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,559
and in so doing when you do all these

593
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
things then you create an environment

594
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
where there's trust people

595
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,360
feel like they can be free and talk and

596
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
be happy because if you have a happy

597
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
environment

598
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,039
you'd have people who would deliver

599
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,919
because they feel comfortable in the

600
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,840
environment

601
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:13,120
within which they work okay

602
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,320
okay so let's move to the next one uh

603
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
this is um we're just going to talk here

604
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,840
about the

605
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,679
seven ways or steps to create an ei team

606
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,559
um

607
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,919
with these seven steps um i believe that

608
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,679
if you go through it

609
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
you you're on your way to a winner

610
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,799
so the first step at the top is

611
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,360
having a ring leader so

612
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,080
like i said earlier it's not easy to

613
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
create

614
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,799
the right environment where there's

615
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:49,679
trust there's a sense of group

616
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,000
and identity there's the sense of yeah

617
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
we're

618
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,919
building you know together we stand

619
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,679
together we fall that kind of thing

620
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,000
that's the right environment you want to

621
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,039
create but it starts with you yourself

622
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,960
you the ring leader you always there's a

623
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,880
there's a famous quote that a lot of

624
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,440
people in the change space always talk

625
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919
about from

626
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,120
gandhi i believe which says that you

627
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,240
have to be the change you want to see

628
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:17,200
if you as a leader want everyone to be

629
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
at work at nine o'clock and you walk

630
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,520
into work at

631
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,559
midday hello they're also gonna do the

632
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,679
same

633
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,200
because i i for one always feel like if

634
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,799
you go into an environment

635
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,039
and you see the way people behave

636
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,840
it tends in most invariably in most

637
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,320
instances

638
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,159
to be a depiction of you the leader

639
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,200
yourself

640
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,400
so as a as as the ring leader you need

641
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,120
to start off

642
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,520
by working on yourselves you need to go

643
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,600
through

644
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,320
all the different steps i highlighted in

645
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,880
the previous slide with regards to e.i

646
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,200
like self-awareness emotional management

647
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,640
effective communication

648
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,080
social awareness uh conflict resolution

649
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,320
you need to be the kind of

650
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,360
leader that is respected by the team um

651
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,039
you need to create the the let them know

652
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,840
that you are there for them

653
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,679
you've got your the back of your team

654
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,039
members if i may say so

655
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,159
let that be polite and be be respectful

656
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,279
to your team members

657
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,360
show willingness to change listen

658
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,279
you know and listening is such an

659
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,960
important thing it's not the kind of

660
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,039
listen when someone is talking to

661
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,440
you're like yeah okay are you on your

662
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,400
laptop sending an email away or sending

663
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,600
a text message

664
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,440
no put everything down sit down make

665
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,320
time for whoever is in your team that

666
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
has sought you

667
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,240
out and listen to them because it's very

668
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,799
important

669
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,440
that the team members know that you are

670
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,360
their ring leader

671
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:56,000
when there are mistakes that you made

672
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,559
just go out and say i messed up guys

673
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
there's so much power in doing that to

674
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
you know

675
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,159
so always do that always be helpful

676
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,240
always be there for them

677
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,559
right and move on to the next one which

678
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,400
is identifying the team's

679
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,400
members strengths and weaknesses

680
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,240
it's not only about

681
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,679
just getting different individuals i'm

682
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,000
sure that

683
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,600
all the members in the team have been

684
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,240
hired because they have

685
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,480
their unique strengths and weakness and

686
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
their unique strengths and talents that

687
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,279
you think is best for the team but then

688
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,440
everyone has what they're good at

689
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,159
so sometimes it's good to know each

690
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
individual beyond what the workspace you

691
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,240
know

692
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,720
so you also know what they are

693
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,120
passionate at you also know

694
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,000
what they enjoy doing bring those

695
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,480
strengths out

696
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
also look at in every team you have the

697
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,600
quieter ones don't leave them

698
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,480
on this journey all galvanize them

699
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,279
encourage

700
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,720
people for like people who are stronger

701
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,960
technically for example

702
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,400
encore encourage them to pair up with

703
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,720
those that are

704
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,679
not as strong in a particular topic or

705
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,360
area so that

706
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,520
they can they can pass on the knowledge

707
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
for a lot for some of the teams in some

708
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,640
environments i've worked for fridays for

709
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,640
example

710
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,480
we have brownback sessions where team

711
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
members would come and teach other team

712
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,640
members within the team

713
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,520
a different topic encourage innovation

714
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,600
you know

715
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,760
uh that kind of thing and also

716
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,279
when you when people are doing work you

717
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,440
know let them

718
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,960
have do the bits they're good at you

719
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,600
know at the same time

720
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,440
hone in the skills skill sets of the

721
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,120
areas they're not so good at

722
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,559
so that you can have a well-rounded team

723
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,039
um the next thing would be to spark

724
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,120
passion within the team it's not only

725
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,240
about getting the right team

726
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:00,240
but it's also about getting

727
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,080
the right individuals that fit into your

728
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,960
your company culture that fits into

729
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,399
your organization that are in line with

730
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,440
your your goals your

731
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,320
vision that are passionate about it so

732
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,520
they can work

733
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,640
work as well to to to to achieve that

734
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,840
so it's very important to note that as a

735
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,679
leader when picking

736
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,600
people for your team at times

737
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,520
passions will deep dip you know

738
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,799
sometimes you know

739
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,520
life happens and it gets too much as a

740
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,880
team leader

741
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,600
always try to ensure that you notice

742
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,880
that

743
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,440
and get ways for people to re-engage to

744
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,720
to to sort of reignite their first love

745
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
if i may say so

746
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,080
even for those that are married for a

747
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,600
thousand years

748
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,520
with time they have to work at the

749
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,520
relationship for it to work it's the

750
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,799
same thing i'm using practical examples

751
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,840
so people can know

752
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,480
that it's it's doable um also another

753
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,320
good thing

754
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,640
is always recognizing uh

755
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,200
people for the accomplishments and the

756
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,760
good work they've done

757
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
also creating a flexible working

758
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,279
environment

759
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,480
especially for example now we have a

760
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
situation where

761
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,000
all of us are working from home so you

762
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,960
know but then

763
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,600
normally creating that flexibility is

764
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,039
always

765
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,840
uh important

766
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,799
uh to ensure that the passion is there

767
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,679
and the like

768
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,880
yeah i think that covers that much for

769
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,919
sparking passion

770
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,559
and then we'll talk about building team

771
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,440
norms uh with building team norms it's

772
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,200
always good

773
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,600
um even if you had a team to

774
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,600
create an environment where the team

775
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,679
members come together i always recommend

776
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,919
if possible that team members come

777
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,520
together and they create their own

778
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,919
norms and create um they state

779
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,120
this is how we would plan to work

780
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
together as a team

781
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,640
right and another thing that is good is

782
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,159
always

783
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,840
um saying thank you creating the right

784
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,240
harmony ensure that there is lack of

785
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,000
tension

786
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,120
creating a an environment where team

787
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,559
members

788
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,880
like each other because uh well

789
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,799
especially in the i keep saying i'd

790
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
refer to that as the old world because i

791
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,320
think the way we've done work

792
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,640
so far it's going to change but in

793
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,720
environments where we always

794
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,720
see each other every day it's very

795
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,919
important that the environment

796
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,039
is not full of tension and

797
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,120
that team members are working

798
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:43,600
as a unit you know and in so doing

799
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,679
they because i also feel like if the

800
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,200
team members have created their own

801
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,840
norms themselves

802
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,520
then they would commit to fulfilling

803
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,520
these norms because it is

804
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,080
it's a form of self-governance if you

805
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,519
ask me and in so doing you know when you

806
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
see the respect amongst

807
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,600
each other then there's a lot of banter

808
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,840
and the like and people

809
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,720
know not how not to go about crossing

810
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,960
the line

811
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,360
then i think you've that you've done

812
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,799
well in that

813
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,799
instance another big thing is developing

814
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,159
creative ways to manage stress

815
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,480
stress is bound to happen and

816
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,640
but then as a leader for example you

817
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,200
need to see

818
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,799
that's coming your way and coming up

819
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,519
with ways to

820
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,279
handle and deal with the stress because

821
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,919
if stress is not handled

822
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,720
properly it can even lead to health

823
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,399
issues

824
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,240
and having individuals being burnt out

825
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,000
so one of the ways you can deal with

826
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,120
that for example is how you

827
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,440
handle deadlines uh for example if you

828
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,840
have

829
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
projects you're planning when you plan a

830
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,600
project

831
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,039
create a buffer on the timeline by

832
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,960
buffer i mean

833
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,640
if you think that the development is

834
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,279
gonna take two weeks

835
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,360
then make it two weeks and a day or two

836
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,559
just for any eventuality because you

837
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,840
don't want

838
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,919
um the the the individuals working on

839
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,919
the projects to be stressed towards the

840
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,679
end that tends to happen a lot um

841
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,640
another big thing which i always keep

842
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:24,960
talking about is handling grievances

843
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,960
um trying to deal with schedules

844
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,880
also encourage team members to take

845
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,919
breaks

846
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,240
it's saddening at times you go into some

847
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,159
organizations

848
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,600
and you notice that the team members are

849
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,640
under so much pressure that they're

850
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,480
having their lunch

851
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
at their desk so encourage team members

852
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,440
to take

853
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,200
breaks to go out for a walk to get some

854
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,919
fresh air you know

855
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,240
to to to you know it helps you to really

856
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,000
recharge your energies and come back

857
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,519
uh to do your work discourage

858
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,960
multitasking a lot of people think that

859
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,840
multitasking will get some more work

860
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,039
done but

861
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,679
in actually in in in reality

862
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,320
it worsens the situation at times it

863
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
leads to

864
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,000
people having to go back to redo the

865
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,720
work or you're not getting

866
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,519
the the right work that the right

867
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,440
results

868
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,799
and the right quality you want of a

869
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,320
particular job

870
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,840
so try not to get any um

871
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,799
rush to job as well be

872
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,760
um empathetic this i cannot say that

873
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,559
enough

874
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,440
uh for example if you have team members

875
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,679
and you notice that for example

876
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,960
someone is not behaving like the way

877
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,399
they ought to

878
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,760
go and find out what is wrong you know

879
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,279
uh for example i had another instance

880
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
where i had a very team

881
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,679
a team member who used to be quite a

882
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,760
calm guy and all of a sudden was coming

883
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,480
to work and just the slightest thing

884
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,000
the guy was that shouting you know and

885
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
straight away i noticed oh there's

886
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,919
something not right here

887
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,919
so just pulled him aside saying oh let's

888
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,600
go for a walk we had a chat

889
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,240
and it turns out he's going through a

890
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,600
divorce now with that level of stress

891
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
he's coming

892
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,960
to work and he's shouting at everyone

893
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,440
because he's

894
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
going through a lot of drama at home you

895
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,960
know so

896
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,960
always be able to watch out when people

897
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,359
are not behaving

898
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,320
the way they normally do there may be a

899
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,440
problem there

900
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,480
try to find out what the issue is

901
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,639
and find innovative ways ask the person

902
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,800
how can we do to help do you need time

903
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,119
away from work do you need this

904
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,119
you know so in so doing because these

905
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,720
things it's just like having a rotten

906
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,480
apple in a box

907
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,159
full of fresh ones it's gonna

908
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,359
contaminate all the other ones if you

909
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,839
don't take it out

910
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,119
so stress is a very important thing that

911
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,839
you need to deal with

912
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,399
another one is allowing team members to

913
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,359
have a voice

914
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,839
let your team members speak up let them

915
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,440
speak

916
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,240
their their concerns teach your team

917
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,040
members to

918
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,000
communicate effectively you know should

919
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
not be aggression

920
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,920
it should not be a fight it should not

921
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,040
be that i need to be very

922
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,599
loud for my voice to be heard

923
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,960
let them do that let them talk to you

924
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,560
let their voice be heard

925
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,720
at times when you have

926
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
team members especially in teams that

927
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,320
didn't

928
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,520
that relates directly with customers and

929
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,079
end users

930
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,400
they at times come up with amazing

931
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,280
innovative solutions that as a business

932
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,839
you may not have even

933
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,040
thought about so let them pitch these

934
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,440
ideas uh

935
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,119
if you're working in an agile space this

936
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,200
is where another

937
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,280
great thing that the retrospective is

938
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,800
for let them talk about ways we can

939
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,359
improve

940
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,240
but let them have a voice and not only

941
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,200
having a voice

942
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
let them know that their voice and their

943
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,160
opinion

944
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,280
matters it makes a whole lot of

945
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,400
difference

946
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
when someone knows that i can go and say

947
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,760
so

948
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,920
and it's not gonna come up at the end of

949
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,040
the year when there's time for reviews

950
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,119
and for a pay rise

951
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,880
it wouldn't be used negatively against

952
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,599
me because some environments

953
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,880
do that in so doing if you try to go

954
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,920
down that route

955
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,960
you may be losing a good employee

956
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,079
or very good ideas will be lost

957
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,320
because you didn't listen another

958
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,320
important thing is encourage employees

959
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,320
to work and play together

960
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,119
uh for me i've always deemed that to be

961
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,800
very important well nowadays i don't

962
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,040
know how that's gonna change

963
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,960
although now we've been doing virtual

964
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
drinks online which is equally

965
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,400
interesting but

966
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,280
the important thing is that we spend so

967
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,839
much time

968
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,800
working so many hours that it's

969
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,480
important that

970
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,800
the team gets the time to play as well

971
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,320
previously for some of the teams i have

972
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
worked with for example

973
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,880
at the end of a project we would go

974
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,520
bowling we would go

975
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,200
you know a catering class where we cook

976
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
you know that kind of thing sometimes

977
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,000
going to eat

978
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,040
out there was a startup i worked

979
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,079
with and once a month they will do the

980
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,839
the guys will do a gaming night

981
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,320
sadly i was the only girl in the whole

982
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,200
company and i don't do computer games

983
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
but hey

984
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
i was happy to arrange it everything get

985
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,280
all the drinks and everything they

986
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,040
needed and they would spend the whole

987
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,599
night friday night until saturday

988
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,760
morning

989
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,640
i hear they'll stare spend it's doing

990
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,920
their fifa

991
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,640
they're racing whatever but what tends

992
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,400
to happen

993
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,040
is because they bond at that level

994
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,440
you notice coming back to work on monday

995
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,079
that

996
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,200
day there is this banter you know they

997
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,359
relate to each other better they handle

998
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,440
tensions better because they played

999
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,400
together so it's it's it's a very

1000
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,160
important aspect and you know sometimes

1001
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,320
in so doing you hear

1002
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,599
beautiful things about people that you

1003
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,000
wouldn't know you know

1004
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,079
someone who's traveled the world someone

1005
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,520
who maybe spends time for charity

1006
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,760
you know that kind of thing so you

1007
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,920
actually see the person

1008
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,839
because seeing the person always out of

1009
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,440
work helps when you come back to work

1010
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,240
because you just don't see them

1011
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,040
as person a with employee id xyz but

1012
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,520
instead you see the person as maybe

1013
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,960
peter

1014
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,960
father of two peter likes to go mountain

1015
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,880
climbing so you can talk to peter about

1016
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,520
mountain climbing and everything because

1017
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,000
then

1018
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,839
you can relate to them at a personal

1019
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,320
level so it's not just about work

1020
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,280
because

1021
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,079
the person needs to be to feel like they

1022
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
matter

1023
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,119
and i think for me with ei one of the

1024
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
biggest thing is just

1025
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,880
making team members feel like they

1026
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,920
matter because as individuals

1027
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,359
when we feel like we matter

1028
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,119
we perform better oh that should be a

1029
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,320
quarter i should copyright

1030
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,640
okay so uh seems to wear agile um i'll

1031
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,839
just

1032
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,160
also i always always want to link this

1033
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,040
with scrum values because

1034
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,839
we shouldn't think that this is really

1035
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,040
far from us

1036
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,800
i've seen uh and i've mentioned some

1037
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,359
amazing scrum masters

1038
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,160
and one of the reasons why they've been

1039
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,520
good at it

1040
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,000
has been because of the

1041
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,359
their high ei score because of the

1042
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,119
empathy they have

1043
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,440
towards their team members because of

1044
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,760
the way they feel

1045
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,000
and want to do everything and to ensure

1046
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,040
that their team members are well so

1047
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,560
um for me when i look at the scrum

1048
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,119
values it just screams ei to me but

1049
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,240
maybe i'm just a crazy agile lady so

1050
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,280
when we talk about

1051
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,440
courage um that is just talking about

1052
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
scrum team members having the courage to

1053
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,119
do the right thing

1054
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,079
having the courage to work on tough

1055
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,160
problems

1056
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,400
but also having the courage to speak

1057
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,040
what they think

1058
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,520
when we look at focus it's everyone

1059
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,599
focusing on the work of the sprint

1060
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,760
and they're focused on the goals of the

1061
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,119
scrum team because they committed to the

1062
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,760
goals themselves

1063
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,720
they are motivated to deliver these

1064
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,599
goals

1065
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,520
commitments people personally committing

1066
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,240
to achieve the goals of the scrum team

1067
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,000
because

1068
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,680
there's nothing worse than having people

1069
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,920
not committed to the work they're doing

1070
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,040
you would not get the results you want

1071
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,319
so being able to be to commit to that

1072
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,040
is very important respect respect

1073
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,560
is one of the biggest things as far as i

1074
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,520
am concerned

1075
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,920
because when it comes to respect scrum

1076
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,400
team members need to respect each other

1077
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,640
to be

1078
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,599
capable and independent people it's not

1079
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,599
only

1080
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
about you know seeing someone and

1081
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,319
calling the person mr a

1082
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,359
and mr b no respect it's one of those

1083
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,319
things that is so

1084
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,200
difficult to achieve but they're so easy

1085
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,319
to lose

1086
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,760
treat people with respect you know it's

1087
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,480
it's it's so beautiful when you go into

1088
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,119
organizations and you see

1089
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,480
leaders making time to speak to people

1090
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,720
in the canteen

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,640
to the cleaners and everything in so

1092
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,960
doing they have respect there was

1093
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,640
um i think there was a video i saw on

1094
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,480
the news once when the

1095
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,040
i think it was the dutch prime minister

1096
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,079
also who was walking around he spilled

1097
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,240
his coffee

1098
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,000
he took the mop himself he mopped it

1099
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,359
despite the fact that the cleaning lady

1100
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,720
wanted to do it in so doing you know

1101
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:29,440
the respect he showed to that person

1102
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,560
and the respect he earned was just

1103
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,160
phenomenal because

1104
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,720
everyone was talking about it and

1105
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,680
everyone was talking about how amazing a

1106
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,800
leader

1107
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,000
he is so this is very important that we

1108
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,480
bring that across

1109
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,119
we give it and we receive it as well if

1110
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
you want it

1111
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,800
you have to give it respect to me

1112
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,560
also means that when i'm angry i don't

1113
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,079
shout at another person

1114
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,400
that person at work may be

1115
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,119
working in my team and i may be the

1116
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,319
manager

1117
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,839
but at home this person is is is a

1118
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,160
leader in society

1119
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,359
this person is someone's father or

1120
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,680
someone's mother

1121
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,960
who talks to them with respect so let's

1122
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,680
bear that in mind

1123
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,079
when we're dealing with people openness

1124
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,960
being

1125
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,000
open so the scrum team and its

1126
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,160
stakeholders agree

1127
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,400
to be open about all the work and

1128
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,400
challenges with performing the work

1129
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,680
if you are open i think that it's it's

1130
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,200
freeing even to be

1131
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,200
open because um when you're open you

1132
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,240
just say the issues as they are

1133
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,680
and if you in so doing most of the time

1134
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,400
you actually get um your issues resolved

1135
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,480
quicker than you would envisage one of

1136
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,480
the projects i even worked on i had

1137
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,480
an impediments board it was quite a new

1138
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,240
project right in the middle because i

1139
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,359
of the room because you open the door

1140
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,119
the first thing you saw was the

1141
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,560
impediments board because i had all the

1142
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,839
senior stakeholders coming

1143
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,839
and they'll look and say oh who do you

1144
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,880
need to fix it and it's fixed

1145
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,400
so being open is another good one i'd

1146
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,960
end here by saying that

1147
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
um in order to be successful in an agile

1148
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,359
environment

1149
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,079

1150
