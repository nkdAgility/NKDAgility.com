In today's fast-paced business world, managers are expected to not only manage but also lead. This shift can be daunting, especially when there’s little to no training or guidance provided. Most managers are left to figure out how to become leaders on their own. While some exceptional individuals thrive in this environment, many would benefit from a bit of help. That’s where agile leadership training comes into play.

## The Challenge of Transitioning to Leadership

Many organizations assume that leadership skills will just develop naturally. However, the reality is that transitioning from management to leadership requires a different mindset and skillset. Most managers are thrust into leadership roles without the necessary support or training.

- 🔍 **Lack of Direction**: Managers are often expected to develop leadership skills on their own.

- 🧠 **Different Skillsets**: Leadership, especially in an agile environment, demands new approaches like servant leadership.

- 🚀 **The Exceptional Few**: While some managers adapt quickly, the majority need guidance and training.

### The Need for Training: Agile Leadership

One of the primary training programs that can support this transition is the **Professional Agile Leadership class**. This course focuses on helping managers understand the principles of servant leadership and apply them effectively within their teams.

#### Key Areas Covered in Agile Leadership Training:

1. **Delegation**: Learning how to empower others by delegating tasks effectively.

3. **Hiring the Right People**: Building a strong, self-sufficient team by selecting individuals who thrive in agile environments.

5. **Connecting Work with Outcomes**: Ensuring that team members understand how their efforts align with broader organizational goals.

This shift to servant leadership allows managers to focus on enabling their teams to succeed, rather than micromanaging their every move. It’s a fundamental change in mindset that helps teams become more autonomous and productive.

## Understanding the Bigger Picture: Evidence-Based Management

In addition to leadership training, it’s equally important for managers to understand how their efforts impact the overall organization. The **Evidence-Based Management** (EBM) class is designed to teach leaders how to measure progress effectively and make data-driven decisions.

Most managers don’t have a holistic understanding of their organization’s current status or future trajectory. Without proper measurement systems in place, it’s difficult to know if the changes being implemented are truly beneficial.

### The Importance of Measurement in Leadership

- 📊 **Measuring Progress**: Leaders need to design and implement measurements that are unique to their organization or product.

- 🎯 **Aligning Outcomes**: These measurements should focus on determining whether progress is being made toward key organizational goals.

- 🚦 **Data-Driven Decisions**: Making informed decisions based on real data ensures that teams are moving in the right direction.

#### Evidence-Based Management Class Focus:

1. **Creating Effective Metrics**: Developing custom metrics tailored to specific organizational goals.

3. **Measuring Impact**: Understanding how the actions of a team influence overall outcomes.

5. **Maximizing Organizational Effectiveness**: Using evidence and data to make informed, strategic decisions that benefit the entire organization.

## Why Agile Leadership and Evidence-Based Management Go Hand-in-Hand

Both the **Professional Agile Leadership** and **Evidence-Based Management** classes complement each other. While agile leadership helps managers become effective servant leaders, EBM provides the tools to measure the effectiveness of their leadership and organizational progress. Together, these skills empower leaders to guide their teams more effectively and ensure that their efforts align with the organization's long-term goals.

### A Personal Example from My Experience

I remember working with a manager who was fantastic at organizing tasks and ensuring deadlines were met. However, when the organization transitioned to an agile approach, he struggled to let go of control. He wanted to micromanage every aspect of the team's work, which led to frustration among team members and a lack of trust.

After attending the Professional Agile Leadership class, he completely transformed his leadership style. Instead of controlling every detail, he learned to delegate and trust his team. He became more of a mentor than a manager, guiding the team and connecting their work to the larger organizational goals. The result? The team became more engaged, productivity increased, and the overall work environment improved dramatically.

This shift was further reinforced by his participation in the Evidence-Based Management class. With the new measurement tools he learned, he was able to track the team's progress toward organizational goals more effectively. Instead of relying on gut feelings, he used data to make informed decisions that benefited both the team and the organization as a whole.

## Why Managers Should Invest in Their Leadership Skills

Leadership is not something that happens overnight, and it’s not something that should be expected without guidance. Most managers need help transitioning into leadership roles, and that’s okay. Training programs like **Professional Agile Leadership** and **Evidence-Based Management** provide the tools and knowledge necessary for managers to become effective leaders in an agile world.

### Key Takeaways:

- 🎯 **Servant Leadership is Crucial**: Leaders should focus on enabling their teams rather than controlling them.

- 📊 **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Use metrics to ensure that organizational goals are being met.

- 🌱 **Continuous Learning**: Leadership is a skill that requires continuous development, and training programs are essential for that growth.

If you’re a manager who’s transitioning into a leadership role or someone who wants to improve their leadership effectiveness, I highly recommend exploring these training opportunities. They provide a solid foundation for becoming the kind of leader who not only empowers teams but also ensures that the entire organization moves in the right direction.
