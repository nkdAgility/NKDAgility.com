# Why is training such a critical element in a manager or leader's journey

As the world increases in complexity, it can be tough to make the transition from traditional #manager to #agileleader. All the behaviours, processes and tools that made you successful as a manager now need to be revisited and reinvented to adapt to complex environments, and that can be a minefield to navigate if you've never received any formal #scrumtraining.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why #training is critical for mangers and aspiring agile leaders if they are to help their teams thrive.
