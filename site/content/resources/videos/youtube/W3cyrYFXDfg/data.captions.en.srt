[Music]

2
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,320
most managers today are just expected to

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,960
be leaders as well they're given no

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,799
training no Direction they're just

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,519
magically supposed to come up with these

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,720
skills themselves and that's just not

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:23,199
always the case there are exceptional

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,000
people that don't need uh um any

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,760
additional uh input of knowledge that

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,679
they're able to go off and find out all

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
of this stuff themselves and put it into

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,040
effect

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,280
but most of us benefit from a little bit

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,440
of a helping hand um so we have the the

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,960
agile leadership class which focuses on

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,960
um a manager transitioning into that

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,879
servant leadership idea where they're

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,359
providing services to the team they're

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,680
enabling a team to be

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:59,879
effective um at the organization level

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,640
so that's somebody who is who is learn

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,400
learning how to delegate um learning how

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,560
to hire the right people um learning how

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,880
to um connect the people doing the work

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,640
with the outcomes that we're trying to

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,640
achieve and all of those things are part

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,159
of the professional adual leadership

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,240
class um but in addition to that as a

29
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,479
leader it's important to understand how

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,560
the the the changes that we're making in

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,040
the

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,640
organization B benefit the overall

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,200
organization increase the effectiveness

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,640
of the overall organization and for that

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,040
we have the evidence-based management

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,320
class as well where we're looking a

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,240
little bit more deeply into how we

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,920
measure people what the impact of those

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,079
measurements are and how can

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,759
we maximize the

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
effectiveness in and how do we measure

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,640
that right that's effectively what it is

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,719
how do we measure that and so it's very

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,319
important that we understand all of

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,280
those things as a a leader in an

46
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,000
organization um so that we can make the

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,800
right choices and know for sure that

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,160
we're making progress in in the right

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
direction because we've designed a bunch

50
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,400
of measures that are unique to our organ

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,959
our product or our organization uh to

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,640
help us see whether we're making

53
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,760
progress towards the overall outcomes

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,800
that we're trying to achieve um

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,760
and most managers and leaders don't

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,200
measure those things they don't have a

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,000
have a holistic understanding of where

58
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,599
the organization currently is where the

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,640
organization's currently going and how

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
we're going to measure uh that progress

61
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,159
towards it and that really those two

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,640
things are are part of the key focus of

63
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,480
