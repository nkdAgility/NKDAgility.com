However, it does not explicitly mention Scrum roles, events, or artifacts, leading to a lower direct mention score. The conceptual alignment is moderate as it touches on themes of team effectiveness and leadership within an Agile context, but lacks depth in discussing specific Scrum practices. Overall, while it relates to Agile methodologies, it does not focus primarily on Scrum.",
