Nowhere in the content is Service Level Expectation (SLE) directly mentioned or alluded to, nor are its defining components (elapsed time ranges, probability, Kanban flow, etc.) or applications discussed. While there is some generic discussion of measurement, metrics, and evidence-based approaches, these are discussed in the context of business outcomes, not SLE or Kanban/Scrum flow metrics. The main audience is well-aligned in terms of agile practitioners/managers, but the intent, depth, and alignment with SLE are very minimal or absent. Thus, all scores remain extremely low, with slight variation to reflect that metrics are tangentially referenced. No penalties are necessary as there is no outdated or contradictory content.
