So what should you do if the Sprint review delivers harsh, scathing feedback? I feel like it's more likely that you get no feedback at all. That's as scathing as you can get. We don't care enough to give you any feedback, right? 

But perhaps you should consider what it is you're building and what the direction it is that you're taking the product in. So thinking about, are we building the right thing? Right? Are we building stuff that our stakeholders care about? If we're not building stuff our stakeholders care about, why would you expect them to turn up and give you feedback? 

If they're forced to turn up, right? Like they've been told it's mandatory, they turn up and they don't say anything, it's because they have to turn up and they don't care. You want your stakeholders to want to turn up and want to give you that feedback. 

And if you get a bunch of negative feedback, that's awesome! Right? That's our indicator that we're going in the wrong direction, that we're maybe doing something wrong, or maybe we're doing something right. We were deliberately trying to ruffle feathers and generate some more ideation in the product. 

But the product owner and the whole Scrum team needs to really focus on what's next. If we get horrible feedback, they hate our products. Are we even building the right product? Is it even worth continuing the product? Is it worth investing in this? Do we need to change tactical direction? Do we need to change strategic direction? Have we got the right product? 

These are all questions that you can ask during that Sprint review. And don't, in a Sprint review, just go, "We got bad feedback," and stop the Sprint review. You need to dive into why you're getting negative feedback. What do the stakeholders think? What's the difference between what the stakeholders expected and what they got, so that you can try and close that gap? 

If you don't know what that gap is, if you don't know where they thought you would be, you don't know how to get there. And it could be that we just cancel the product. That's a perfectly valid outcome from a Sprint review. We decide that, you know, somebody had a great idea, somebody thought it was worth spending some money on, we tried to spend some money on it, and we didn't have any good outcomes. So stop wasting money and go after the next idea, something different, right? That's entirely possible. 

So the kind of three, I guess, three outcomes from a Sprint review are: stop doing what you're doing, that's one outcome; pivot. We love that word, don't we? We pivot and change direction, right? We need to do something slightly different or even a lot different. Or perhaps perseverance, right? We know we're on the right track. It's not yet resonating with the customer base, but we have a firm conviction and belief that this is the right way forward and that we'll be able to get there. 

And that's your three choices at the end of the Sprint review. Make them well.
