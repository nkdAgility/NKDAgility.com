1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,660
so what should you do if the Sprint

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,780
review delivers harsh scathing feedback

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,779
um I feel like it's more likely that you

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,000
get no feedback at all that's as scaling

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,520
as you can get we don't care enough to

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
give you any feedback right

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,380
um but perhaps you should consider what

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,840
it is you're building and what the

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,820
direction it is that you're taking the

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,480
product in

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,800
um so thinking about are we building the

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,540
right thing

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,640
right are we building stuff that our

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,440
stakeholders care about if we're not

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,940
building stuff or stakeholders care

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,500
about why would you expect them to turn

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,320
up and give you feedback

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,719
if if they're forced to turn up right

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,280
like they've been told it's mandatory

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,140
they turn up and they don't say anything

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
it's because they have to turn up and

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,520
they don't care

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,219
you want your stakeholders to want to

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,719
turn up and want to give you that

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,640
feedback

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,220
um and if you get a bunch of negative

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,580
feedback that's awesome

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,020
right that's that's that's our in our

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,460
indicator that we're going in the wrong

30
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,900
direction that we're maybe doing

31
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,340
something wrong or maybe it's we're

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,659
doing something right we're right we

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,360
were deliberately trying to ruffle

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,520
feathers and and and and and generate

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,439
some more ideation in the product but

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,220
the product owner and the whole scrum

37
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,500
team needs to really focus on on what's

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,079
what's next if we get horrible feedback

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,579
they hate our products

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,740
are we even building the right product

41
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,079
is it even worth continuing the product

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,960
is it worth investing in this do we need

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,520
to change tactical direction do we need

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
to change strategic Direction have we

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,680
got the right product go these are all

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,280
questions that you can ask uh during

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,280
that Sprint review and don't don't in a

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,040
Sprint review don't just go we got bad

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,439
feedback and stop the Sprint review you

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,420
need to dive into why you're getting

51
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,039
negative feedback what do the

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,140
stakeholders what's the difference

53
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,959
between what the stakeholders expected

54
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,180
and what they got so that you can try

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,739
and close that cap right if you don't

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,780
know what that Gap is if you don't know

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,700
where they thought you would be

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,620
um you don't know how to get there and

59
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,140
uh it could be that we just canceled the

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,420
product that's that's a perfectly valid

61
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,640
outcome from a Sprint review is we

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,800
decide that you know we somebody had a

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,959
great idea somebody thought it was worth

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,700
spending some money on we tried to spend

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,959
some money on it and we didn't have any

66
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,879
good outcomes so stop wasting money and

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,220
go after the next idea at something

68
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,819
different right that's entirely possible

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,060
so the kind of kind of three I guess

70
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,519
three outcomes from a Sprint review

71
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,920
um are stop doing what you're doing

72
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,220
that's one outcome

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,739
um pivot we love that word don't we we

74
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,360
pivot and change direction right we need

75
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,280
to do something slightly different or

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,879
even a lot different

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,860
um or perhaps perseverance right we know

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
we're on the right track it's not yet

79
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,260
resonating with the with the customer

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,700
base but we have a firm conviction and

81
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,800
belief that this is the right way

82
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,300
forward and that we'll be able to get

83
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,620
there and that's that's that's your

84
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,060
three choices at the end of the Sprint

85
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,659
review

86
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,360
um

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,860
