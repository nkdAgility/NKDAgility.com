1
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:16,429
very giving you trouble

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,329
ah

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,329
[Music]

4
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:37,230
Russell is a bike it is most he is back

5
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:44,910
awesome yeah i and better than anything

6
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:48,839
it was I Internet and my whole home

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,320
network brushed I believe because I'm on

8
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:55,610
a cabled connection here oh no just

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,110
it totally disappeared but we are back

10
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:59,909
Wi-Fi went as well everything went I

11
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,820
don't know what happened maybe I'll have

12
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:07,400
to reboot there

13
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:09,570
well I think I think we were much coming

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,590
close there was anything you wanted to

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:19,130
add what what the things that we could

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,130
do differently us

17
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:32,860
I think that police technology

18
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,359
mr. Burke

19
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:47,830
wanted

20
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,030
so those a bit of a disadvantage but I

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,570
think there's some other ways that we

22
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:56,110
can technology because connected in ways

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,330
that we aren't in a live class same room

24
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,480
but I can't flip out a video I can't

25
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,290
whip out a website and expose it to

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,510
everyone

27
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,150
quite as quickly as I can in the live

28
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,060
virtual class so I think that I'm going

29
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,820
to take more advantage of that to to

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:16,480
increase the value that the students get

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,520
that candidly they that's one area that

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,770
we can that we can offer students that

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,320
in ways that isn't quite the same as a

34
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,510
live class for instance I'm in front of

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,640
the class but if my laptop is behind me

36
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,860
then if I want to show a video or an

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,170
image then it's a bit of a I have to

38
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,300
walk back and then touch my machine and

39
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,830
because I'm not but I'm teaching in

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,350
front of a class I'm in front of a

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,270
whiteboard or a flipchart or you know in

42
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,100
the back of the room and I'm not hands

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,300
on keyboard all the time so one of the

44
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,630
things that I think I'll do it and to

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,370
make it better is to try to leverage

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:52,989
that technology to improve the

47
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:57,870
experience for the students I totally

48
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:57,870
agree and I tried my best to have

49
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,549
Oh oh you did know don't get me wrong I

50
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,889
just think that that there's if you

51
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,540
think about strength finders right like

52
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,730
what are what is the strength of the

53
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,620
medium well we can double down on the

54
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,870
strength of the medium yeah I was

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,379
actually thinking about how we talked

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,180
about a bit Marquette's video and we

57
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:29,579
talked about some other things maybe

58
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,519
there's a way we can and that that

59
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,349
content when it becomes the streaming

60
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,069
software I used sends me an email when

61
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,629
the stream is finished

62
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,629
been able to cut the slack

63
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,510
now what were you saying there because

64
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,510
you lost

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,590
was simply saying that what I was saying

66
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,540
when we got cut off but after after I

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,500
didn't hear you I added that there's

68
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,040
probably some some things that came up

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,550
contextually during the course that that

70
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,110
had I anticipated and I think well you

71
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,570
know now that I've experienced them this

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,310
is my first live virtual pal II class

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:20,560
and so now that I in stit I think I have

74
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,260
an opportunity to have some things in my

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
hip pocket that I didn't never had the

76
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,700
opportunity to utilize in an in-person

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,360
class and so that's what I'm trying to

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,650
do next

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:38,970
next time I participate in a pally in a

80
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,970
live virtual training circumstance yes

81
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:48,130
yes disadvantages there's some strong

82
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,770
advantages to lack of having to travel

83
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,900
right lack of having to have physical

84
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,200
contact with people that candidly you

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,150
don't know if they're well or not there

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,030
are some travel expenses that people

87
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,669
often incur to take training and so I

88
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,230
think that that as as people begin to

89
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,540
hear experiences of other students

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,430
they're going to realize that that

91
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,580
although we love the live training

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,830
there's some in my opinion there's in my

93
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,780
experience there's some significant

94
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,700
advantages that aren't always obvious to

95
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,150
people who haven't ever experienced it

96
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:30,430
before that makes sense it does and I

97
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:33,880
think we're running up against at flakes

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:39,180
be honest I'm just saying I think we're

99
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,180
running up against that every season

100
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,390
7:00 p.m. and UK 8 p.m. in Europe and

101
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:52,020
everybody you mean oh I think which

102
00:05:48,390 --> 00:06:03,540
probably there hopefully will be able to

103
00:05:52,020 --> 00:06:08,520
do their class together as well oh well

104
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,920
I will hopefully work with you again

105
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:18,630
okay

106
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:20,400
look forward to it Martin naked agility
