Very giving you trouble. Ah. 

Russell is a bike, it is most. He is back. Awesome, yeah. I and better than anything, it was I Internet and my whole home network brushed, I believe, because I'm on a cabled connection here. Oh no, just it totally disappeared, but we are back. Wi-Fi went as well, everything went. I don't know what happened, maybe I'll have to reboot there.

Well, I think we were much coming close. There was anything you wanted to add? What are the things that we could do differently, us?

I think that police technology, Mr. Burke wanted, so those a bit of a disadvantage. But I think there's some other ways that we can technology because connected in ways that we aren't in a live class, same room. But I can't flip out a video, I can't whip out a website and expose it to everyone quite as quickly as I can in the live virtual class. So I think that I'm going to take more advantage of that to increase the value that the students get. That candidly, that's one area that we can offer students that in ways that isn't quite the same as a live class. For instance, I'm in front of the class, but if my laptop is behind me, then if I want to show a video or an image, then it's a bit of a... I have to walk back and then touch my machine. Because I'm not, but I'm teaching in front of a class, I'm in front of a whiteboard or a flipchart or, you know, in the back of the room, and I'm not hands on keyboard all the time. So one of the things that I think I'll do to make it better is to try to leverage that technology to improve the experience for the students.

I totally agree, and I tried my best to have...

Oh, you did? No, don't get me wrong. I just think that there's... if you think about strength finders, right? Like, what is the strength of the medium? Well, we can double down on the strength of the medium.

Yeah, I was actually thinking about how we talked about a bit Marquette's video, and we talked about some other things. Maybe there's a way we can... and that content, when it becomes the streaming software I used, sends me an email when the stream is finished.

Now, what were you saying there? Because you lost...

Was simply saying that what I was saying when we got cut off, but after... after I didn't hear you, I added that there's probably some things that came up contextually during the course that I had anticipated. And I think, well, you know, now that I've experienced them, this is my first live virtual pal II class. And so now that I in stit, I think I have an opportunity to have some things in my hip pocket that I didn't never had the opportunity to utilise in an in-person class. And so that's what I'm trying to do next.

Next time I participate in a pal in a live virtual training circumstance.

Yes, yes. Disadvantages, there's some strong advantages to lack of having to travel, right? Lack of having to have physical contact with people that candidly you don't know if they're well or not. There are some travel expenses that people often incur to take training. And so I think that as people begin to hear experiences of other students, they're going to realise that although we love the live training, there's some, in my opinion, there's in my experience, there's some significant advantages that aren't always obvious to people who haven't ever experienced it before.

That makes sense.

It does, and I think we're running up against... at flakes, to be honest. I'm just saying, I think we're running up against that every season. 7:00 p.m. in UK, 8 p.m. in Europe and everybody, you mean...

Oh, I think which probably there... hopefully will be able to do their class together as well.

Oh, well, I will hopefully work with you again.

Okay.
