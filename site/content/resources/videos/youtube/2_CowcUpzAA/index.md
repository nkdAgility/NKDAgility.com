# Why is training such a critical element in a product owner journey

You'll find that its fairly common for a #projectmanager or #manager to be assigned the #productowner role in a #scrum environment without them receiving any kind of formal training or skills development.

It is a pity because the #productowner accountability requires a great deal of knowledge, skill, and entrepreneurial flair. It's a powerful role that can create heaps of competitive advantage in the product market place if done well.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why #scrumtraining is a critical part of the #productowner journey, and why you should consider levelling up if you have no formal training as a product owner.
