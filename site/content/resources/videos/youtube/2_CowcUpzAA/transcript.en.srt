[Music]

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,279
most product

3
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:09,000
owners or people that have been given

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:12,920
the role or accountability of product

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,039
owner don't really comprehend the the

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,439
the bread of the product owner role and

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:24,039
it's generally sold to them or told to

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,720
them as being focused on um creating a

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,920
product backlog and making the team work

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,559
through it um and that's a very small

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,200
part of of a product owner um a product

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,760
owner is really an agile product manager

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,840
right they're a product manager that has

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,000
a bunch of additional skills and

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,879
understandings um that that are

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,920
encapsulated a little bit in the

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,719
accountability of the product owner in

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,480
scrum um and it it's really important

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,120
that um product

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,840
owners understand the breadth of the

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,159
possibilities of the product owner role

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,799
what it is they're supposed to be

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,159
looking at um and I I I find that the

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,640
quite often Mo most people who come to a

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,479
product owner class um realize that they

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,200
don't want to be product owners because

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,159
it's a lot bigger role with more actual

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,720
accountability um than they really

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,880
realized that it was it it was in the

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,200
first place um so a product owner is

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,439
accountable for spending the

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,159
money right that a product owner is

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,520
accountable for that if you even if as a

34
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:43,960
product owner you only have control over

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,759
ordering that product backlog right

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,000
maybe you can't even delete stuff from

37
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,880
the product backlog maybe you can't add

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
new stuff that you come up with yourself

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,880
but you're just ordering that product

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,039
backlog then you're controlling the

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,680
budget you're deciding when we deliver

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,119
each piece of functionality um and that

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,000
that's that's really powerful if you can

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,280
then gain the ability to remove and add

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,120
things to the product backlog you're

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,319
then going to be hopefully more

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,120
effectively spending that budget um and

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,920
for a product owner that that means a

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,000
lot of things right what what do you

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,599
think a product owner in order to

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,599
maximize the value of the work done

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,040
right so we're going to put stuff in the

53
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,400
product backlog team's going to work

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,760
through it maximize the value of that

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,640
work um what do we need to look at what

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,519
information do we need and what what

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,760
controls and levers do we need to be

58
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,080
able to have those conversations because

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,280
it's it's not just about focusing on the

60
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:51,080
backlog and the team it's not just about

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,040
being a a funnel for the the um requests

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,400
from the organization right it's about

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,280
making decisions it's about placing bets

64
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:03,319
it's about looking at probabilities of

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,680
what's what do we think is the most

66
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,640
effective uh uh thing to work on what's

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,319
going to produce the most value now um

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,360
for the organization or the most

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
long-term value depending on your your

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,400
your timelines and topics that you're

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,640
you're thinking of delivering in the

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,080
product so as a product owner you really

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
need to be looking out into the future

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,920
you need to be looking at what's

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,159
happening in the business what's the

76
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:33,519
trend in the market how do I um get to

77
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,439
where I need to be in order that instead

78
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
of me looking at my competitors and

79
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,640
saying oo that's cool functionality we

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,879
should add that that they're looking at

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,920
my features and they want to add and

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,319
follow my Trend that I'm setting for

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,400
features and capabilities in the market

84
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,200
effectively shifting your product from

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,599
following the market to Leading the

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,239
market and in order to do that you need

87
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,159
a clear picture of of a lot of

88
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,640
information you need access to levers

89
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,879
within the organization to be able to um

90
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,959
change what you're working on based on

91
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,560
those needs and that understanding right

92
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,840
what's the next bet what's the next uh

93
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,200
uh hypothesis that you have for

94
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,040
something that you think is going to

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,440
provide value and can you invest in it

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,400
and that takes a lot of building

97
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,199
relationships understanding uh uh the

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,919
the the business in the market that lots

99
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,199
of people don't don't understand as part

100
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,880
of the product owner role so if you want

101
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,360
to be a product owner just coming to a

102
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,759
training class is not going to help you

103
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,840
be the best product owner okay but a

104
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:48,840
training class is going to help broaden

105
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,320
the scope of your understanding of what

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,120
that role is and what are the different

107
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,039
tools and techniques that you can at

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,320
least start with to start investing in

109
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,639
some of those areas that perhaps you're

110
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,240
missing that the value of coming to a

111
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,360
product owner class if you want to have
