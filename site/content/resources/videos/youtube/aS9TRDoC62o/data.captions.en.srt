1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,779
if a client

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,939
so if you're doing agile why should you

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,800
incorporate devops

4
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,399
I think

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,920
the core answer is that

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,860
um you can't really if you're building

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
software products I'll caveat that if

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,640
you're building software products you

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,360
can't do one and not the other

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,180
um devops is really synonymous with this

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,940
idea of engineering excellence

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,039
right um of shortening the feedback loop

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,079
making high quality code shifting left

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,000
and those things are part of that that

15
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,699
devops story

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,059
and they need to go up in kind of logger

17
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,559
step with your agile practices and if

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,540
you're doing something else let's say

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
you're doing marketing right uh you're

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,340
delivering marketing out output then

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,540
your agile practices will increase but

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,880
you need to increase your capability of

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,340
your teams to deliver marketing content

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,259
right that's that's that would be that

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,299
technical site in the software world

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,780
it's devops right

27
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,979
um and building up that expertise if if

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,140
you're amazing amazing it

29
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,579
delivering products to production really

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,900
quickly

31
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,060
um of delivering high quality products

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,360
to production really quickly but you

33
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,880
haven't figured out how to

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,000
um adapt your organization so that you

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,399
respond more quickly to the market

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,340
then you're still not going to get the

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,500
value from the devops right push it in

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,979
[Â __Â ] out

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,460
um so trying to figure out how you

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,880
maintain keep increasing your levels of

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,979
of technical capability of uh

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,860
engineering Excellence right on one side

43
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:14,700
at the same Pace as you're increasing

44
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,620
your ability for your organization to

45
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,360
respond to the market right whatever

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,860
Market you're in

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,720
um is really important you have to

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,580
balance that out

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,860
um I mean one can get further ahead than

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,400
the other but you really do need them to

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,739
go in in Step so once you start bringing

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,400
in uh those those engineering Excellence

53
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,360
or devops practices you're able to

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,040
um

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:44,280
allow your engineers to really focus on

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
how how do they shorten uh those those

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,980
feedback loops not just the business

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
feedback loops but the actual

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,300
engineering feedback loops and build

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,180
products that they can get into

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,599
production as quickly as possible so you

62
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,080
can validate all of the assumptions that

63
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,580
you made when you were designing it

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,440
