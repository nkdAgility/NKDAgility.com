1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,040
and I do that both in the technical

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,719
space and in the agile space if you want

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,840
to have a chat you can go to my website

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:14,440
and book a coffee and we can talk about

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,279
agile we can talk about the things that

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,640
are happening in your organization and

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,960
if in half an hour I can fix your

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,519
problem that's great we've had a coffee

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,880
we've had a chat and you get something

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,000
to try that might result in success

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,520
right I I don't I don't do that for d

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,480
direct renumeration I do that because I

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,360
like helping people I like other people

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,680
being successful I want organizations to

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,200
be successful in agile because that

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,760
helps all of us all the employees of the

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,960
company the entire thing the entire

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
