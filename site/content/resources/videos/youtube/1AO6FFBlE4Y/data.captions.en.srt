1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,960
it's a lot more expensive than you think

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,000
having poor quality

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,280
Cod there are lots of hidden impacts

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,520
you've got the the obvious stuff is the

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,199
cost of fixing bugs right because you've

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,000
got poor quality and people find issues

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,119
and that cost gets exponentially more

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
expensive the closer to production you

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,960
get right more expensive for to fix it

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,720
with the customers but you've also got

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,040
the cost of customer support that's

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:38,879
that's obvious stuff the the the things

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,079
that people generally don't think of is

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,920
thing things like brand

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,760
reputation right what what is the impact

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
on poor quality on brand reputation not

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,280
just poor quality in your product but

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,719
poor quality in the way you do things

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,079
the most recent one is crowd strike

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,519
right they they they they had poor

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:05,159
engineering practices that result Ed in

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:08,759
a massive Global impact when something

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,640
went wrong and all all they did was what

24
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,520
lots of companies do which is push

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,320
something to production and didn't

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,200
really think about controlling the blast

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
radius or any of the other modern

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,280
engineering practices that they might

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,159
have so you've get you've got you've got

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
L loss lost to your brand you've got

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,040
you've got productivity of your team

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,240
right if you've everybody's got to run

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,520
around trying to figure figure out what

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,040
the problem is because it's too

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,200
difficult to figure it out

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,439
then you're going to have a massive loss

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,799
of productivity not not just producct

38
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,880
there's lots of engineering practices

39
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,960
that people use that reduce quality but

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,759
they don't think it reduces quality one

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,520
of those is branching right having a a a

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,320
a a really large branching strategy I I

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,560
worked with a a company recently um that

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,360
had 96 teams and they had 96 branches 96

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,879
long running branches one for each team

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,239
and then each team created their own

47
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,760
branches of that um and the cost in Lost

48
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,120
productivity to maintain that to ensure

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,959
that you have working product is just

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,720
enormous and add to that if you're

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,000
maintaining multiple versions of your

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,000
product right this is a massive cost you

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,640
you in

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,120
general you should not be maintaining

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,200
multiple versions of your product you

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,319
should not be supporting multiple

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,040
versions of your product you should be

58
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,720
supporting the latest version of your

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,760
product and not anything

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,000
else in general there are I can off the

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,920
top of my head I can think of

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,480
circumstances where I might have two

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,519
versions of my product or maybe three

64
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,920
absolute tops but if you have more than

65
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,120
that perhaps you have a version of your

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,879
product per customer that's a very

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,400
common one that's a massive cost not

68
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:16,080
just to support and maintenance but in

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,599
in Lost productivity if I'm a developer

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,920
and I UND I I I fixed a problem I fix a

71
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,760
bug right could just be a bug let's take

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,400
that as an example I fix a bug in in in

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,920
the main version of our product the

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,080
latest version of our product but we

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,519
realize that it's in lots of customers

76
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,120
versions maybe there's 10 customer

77
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,599
versions have this this bug can I fix it

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,360
the same in all of those versions

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,480
probably not right because they diverge

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,200
over time and perhaps things that I used

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,360
to fix uh uh the product fix as part of

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,439
the fix in in the main version aren't

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,519
there in older versions or it's slightly

84
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:02,599
different or it's not quite the same

85
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,360
version or all kinds of that increases

86
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,760
the cognitive load on the engineers it

87
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,079
increases the likelihood of something

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,879
going wrong because you're increasing

89
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:15,319
that c cognitive load um and because you

90
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,639
have to backport all of those fixes

91
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,840
across all those different versions

92
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,720
what's the cost and missed opportunities

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,840
because your team's having to mess

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,400
around with lots of work that is

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
avoidable I'm going to put that in there

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
these are all avoidable losses in

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,039
productivity what are the missed

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
opportunities for your business what

99
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,720
features are you not able to ship

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
because it's harder for you to add

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,919
features a a great great fantastic my

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,880
favorite example is some data from the

103
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,880
Azure devox team the aure devops team

104
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,120
had a very long tail on figuring out

105
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,400
whether they they they'd been successful

106
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,720
in in in building the product right the

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
engineers have been successful in the

108
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,440
code that they write and having the test

109
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,440
and validation of those things done and

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,320
it was taking 48 to 72 hours to figure

111
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,120
that out they invested a bunch of time

112
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,560
and energy in paying back poor choices

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
they'd made in the past some of them

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,919
deliberate that's okay but poor choices

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,560
they'd made in the past and things they

116
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,160
didn't realize were poor choices in the

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,600
past that they now realize were poor

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:26,000
choices paying that back it took them

119
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:29,360
nearly four years of investment in that

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,880
story to pay it fully pay it back right

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,000
you know just like if you take out a

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,680
loan you pay it back over a longer

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,400
period of time a little piece at a time

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,120
so they were paying it back as they had

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,759
time they were prioritizing it so it was

126
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,280
important to them so they were spending

127
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,039
time on it but they're also doing other

128
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,360
things so not it's getting done over

129
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,280
time so it took them four years to pay

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:54,080
it back but that

131
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,919
plus fixing that problem refactoring

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,560
that problem re architecting that that

133
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,720
that part of the problem so that they

134
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,720
went from 72 hours that was the longest

135
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
72 hours to find out whether you'd

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
broken stuff to three and a half minutes

137
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,560
right so that's a massive shift so

138
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,759
shifting from long running system tests

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,960
to small discrete unit tests as their

140
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:21,039
measure of validation massively impacted

141
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:26,000
their productivity they went from

142
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:31,560
25ish features to production each year

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,080
with 650 people to over 800 features to

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,560
features to production with the same 600

145
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
people not quite the same right because

146
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,960
it's four years time but more or less

147
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,080
the same 600 people and even in the

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,039
first year when they had a really big

149
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,800
focus on paying that back although there

150
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,319
was a long tail right a really big focus

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,080
on paying it back they spent most of

152
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,479
their time in the first year focusing on

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,319
fixing a lot of these types of

154
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,440
architectural problems of dealing with

155
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,240
that they weren't focused on features

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,520
and they still managed to go from 24

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,960
features to production to like 60

158
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,199
something features to production almost

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,360
three times the number of features were

160
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
delivered to production at the end of

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,599
the first year and they weren't even

162
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
focused on delivering features they were

163
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:22,319
focused on building up engineering

164
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
Excellence fixing those older problems

165
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,440
that had crept in over time you know

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,599
it's like 15 years working on this

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,919
product and it had this massive massive

168
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,000
massive boost to not

169
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:40,840
just productivity right the productivity

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,080
of the team but brand reputation went up

171
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,120
because you're delivering more features

172
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,840
more experiments more things that your

173
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,080
customers need you're missing less

174
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,520
opportunities and you're having less

175
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,120
security breaches because if we're if

176
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,280
we're iterating much more quickly which

177
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,800
is what you're trying to do is reduce

178
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,720
those feedback loops

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,759
you're you can't leave security to the

180
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,319
end one one of the main reasons that

181
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:11,879
that companies get large scale high cost

182
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,599
security

183
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,919
breaches is that they they leave

184
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,400
security is an afterthought it's not

185
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,879
baked into the process and if security

186
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,319
is an

187
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,720
afterthought you find a problem in the

188
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,199
way you've architected your your

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,720
product it's a lot of work to go back

190
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,120
and fix that so most people in teams

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,760
don't because it's maybe hundreds

192
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,279
thousands of hours to go to go fix it or

193
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,839
we could get out the sticky tape and

194
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,000
super glue and stick over the top and

195
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,240
and and create something over the top

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,120
that prevents the hackers getting into

197
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,959
that that flaw but hackers spend copious

198
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,240
amounts of time figuring out how to peel

199
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,279
back the edges of those sticky things

200
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:04,680
and get underneath and and get it access

201
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:07,120
to the system so by paying back this

202
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,399
technical debt of increasing the level

203
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,120
of quality in your

204
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:16,440

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,279
exponential benefits to your ability to

debt is not just a cost it's a oh what

210
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,480
would you call it it missed

211
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,600

212
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,839
you leaving on the table because you

213
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,440
haven't had the ability to go uh tackle

214
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,519
those opportunities you haven't had the

215

things this is fundamentally why having
