00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,919
are teams empowered to change their

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,240
process based on what they

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:10,960
learn if they're not then they're

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,639
probably not very

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,039
agile in order to maximize the

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,560
effectiveness of the teams that we have

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,680
and in order to maximize the value of

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,199
the work that they do get our maximum

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,400
return on investment the people doing

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,160
the work the teams themselves need to be

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,079
able to change the way that they work to

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,120
suit the Nuance of the tools practices

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,280
and techniques that are best suited to

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,719
their context and their context might be

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,480
different from another team that's even

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,960
doing very similar work ensure that your

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,440
teams are empowered to change their

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
process so you can maximize the value

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,960
and the return on investment for your

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,960
stakeholders
