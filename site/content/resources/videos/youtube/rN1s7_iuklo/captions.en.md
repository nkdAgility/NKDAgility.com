Are teams empowered to change their process based on what they learn? If they're not, then they're probably not very agile. 

In order to maximize the effectiveness of the teams that we have and in order to maximize the value of the work that they do, get our maximum return on investment. The people doing the work, the teams themselves, need to be able to change the way that they work to suit the nuance of the tools, practices, and techniques that are best suited to their context. 

Their context might be different from another team that's even doing very similar work. Ensure that your teams are empowered to change their process so you can maximize the value and the return on investment for your stakeholders.
