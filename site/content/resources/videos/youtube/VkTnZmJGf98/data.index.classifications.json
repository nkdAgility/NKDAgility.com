However, discussion centers primarily on organizational success, data-driven decision-making, and market adaptation, often using 'business outcomes' or 'market value' as proxies for customer value, with less detail on direct measurement of customer outcomes, feedback loops, or customer-driven prioritization. The depth is moderate—EBM’s value dimensions and relevance to adaptation are discussed, but actionable customer insight practices are underexplored.
