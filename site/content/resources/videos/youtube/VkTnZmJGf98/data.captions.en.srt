1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,560
evidence evidence-based management has

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,000
improved um agility by a a actually

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,639
having some way to monitor whether we're

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,320
making changes to the

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,800
organization um and I think one of the

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,000
core problems that we we've had is that

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,560
there hasn't been any real metrics and

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,679
if you look at the research out there on

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:35,719
um agility uh in any form whether that's

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:39,079
a a um uh uh plans or uh safe or

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,039
um Dad or less

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:47,480
Nexus um scrum whatever it is you decide

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:50,079
to do in general organizations are not

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,120
being successful by implementing those

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,039
things they're not making systemic

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,559
changes to their organization they're

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,239
not getting the benefits that they

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,600
expected to get and part of the reason

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,400
that that is that is true that they're

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,159
not getting the benefits is that they're

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,159
focusing on the wrong thing we're

22
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,840
focusing on delivering the agile which

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,320
is which is not the point the point of

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,880
of of this is having a successful

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,960
business that delivers value into the

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,560
market so that we increase the the the

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,640
value of our organization right that's

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,360
what we're trying to achieve and agile

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,880
is just a set of tools and practices and

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,240
capabilities that we can use to help us

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,399
be better at that but unless we focus on

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,560
what it is that we're trying to achieve

33
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,799
being being being more successful in the

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,560
market we're not going to get the

35
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,960
benefits from agel because we're not

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,280
going to make the changes in our

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,159
organization that we need in order to be

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,240
successful right that's where when you

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,880
look at organizations that are hugely

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,439
successful at agile a at at in the

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,680
market right and they're using agile

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
they've

43
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,039
monitored what's going on in their

44
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,640
organization and they've changed things

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,399
in their organization the way their

46
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,039
organization functions the way they do

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,319
business the way they lead people the

48
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,200
way they manage people the way the way

49
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,760
everything in their business operates

50
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,640
every process every service every

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,800
workflow has been impacted um and

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,040
they've made those changes based on the

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,120
data that they see right they're able to

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,239
make a change in the way they do their

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,480
business and and monitor that data so

56
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,319
evidence based management

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,200
practices

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,959
is even without using those

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,879
terminologies is how every successful

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,680
organization has become successful right

61
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,280
and then we get complacent once we get

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,879
to a certain size and and the

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,080
organization quite often stagnates every

64
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,720
startup um every startup that ends up

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,040
being successful is using an

66
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,360
evidence-based approach every

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,840
organization that is continuous ly

68
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,959
growing not necessarily through the the

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,720
acquisition model right is a different

70
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,959
model but growing through their ability

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,640
to deliver is is is doing that based on

72
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
looking at the data making the right

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,640
decisions in the market and and

74
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,879
expanding that this is how you scale an

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,640
organization is you use the

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,400
data to figure out what's next so

77
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,840
evidence-based management just

78
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,560
quantifies that and says is you know

79
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,439
just looking at revenue is not a good

80
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,080
idea right we just look at Revenue what

81
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,519
about what about markets we haven't

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,799
tapped yet right the the unrealized

83
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,439
value what about ability to innovate

84
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,879
because if we continuously just deliver

85
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,360
stuff at some point we're going to get

86
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,360
slower and slower at delivering stuff if

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,599
we want to maintain our ability to

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,200
deliver stuff into into into production

89
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,239
hopefully the right stuff right but and

90
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,959
maintain our ability to deliver stuff we

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,599
need to be continually making sure that

92
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,200
our ability to innovate and our uh um

93
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:13,360
time to Market is of a manageable size

94
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,000
right there's balance in this framework

95
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,400
of unrealized value current value

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,919
ability to innovate and time to Market

97
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,440
that enables you as an organization to

98
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,840
make better decisions to focus on the

99
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,880
right things for your business to be

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,560
successful so for forget about the agile

101
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,000
piece right evidence-based management is

102
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,440
about how you adapt your organization to

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,360
be more successful how you enable your

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,039
organization to take uh uh to deal with

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,720
the surprises that come along in the

106
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,120
market so they could be good surprises

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,039
or bad surprises but when things happen

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,039
how quickly can your organization take

109
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,240
advantage of that surprise or mitigate

110
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,880
the the the cost of that surprise um and

111
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,560
that ability to adapt is what people are

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,280
trying to quantify when they talk about

113
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,720
agility so really evidence-based

114
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,919
management is the thing that helps your

115
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,360
organization be successful in the market

116
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,600

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,320
