1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,480
so the question is what's my favorite

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,460
devops Consulting outcome and and I

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,260
really have to go to

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,699
actually one of my

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,859
favorite and longest customers

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,480
um they were building a piece of

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,100
software

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
uh there

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,060
I'm gonna try and not name them but

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,520
they'll know who they are when I'm

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,600
talking about them

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,600
uh they were building a piece of

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,100
software that was massive multi-billion

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,420
dollar

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,420
products

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,000
so ultimately leadership didn't care

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,760
about efficiency so much right when your

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,340
profit margin is in the four to five

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,460
billion dollars and you've only get

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,320
650 people working on it your answer to

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,879
a lot of problems might be can't we just

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,739
hire a bunch of people to solve that

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,660
right which is not always the best way

24
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,480
to to solve a problem

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,540
and we were in the position that

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,659
um it was a very fragmented product so

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,080
there was 80 to 90 teams

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,860
working in 13 locations in nine

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,979
different countries

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:22,080
they all did their own thing so each

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,780
team picked their own source control

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,520
system ran their own source control

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,619
system locally

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,920
there was everything you could possibly

35
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,320
imagine there was uh

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,820
um there was git but not very much of it

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,759
there was team Foundation Version

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,860
Control there was subversion oh there

39
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,840
was just everything there was even a a

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,420
source control system that they built

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,520
themselves right because when they

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,560
started building this product there were

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,659
no good source Control Systems out there

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,820
and they still had people in the company

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,700
using their homegrown Source control

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,939
system lots of fun

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,399
um and in order to

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,680
build this product because it was one

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,360
product that was deployed to a machine

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,459
right so you've got one not one

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,039
executable but it

52
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,440
for one I'm old right it was burned onto

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,420
a CD and then you know that's your your

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,340
install right so it's one install for

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,020
your for your product

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,500
um

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,920
in order to to get that to exist

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,540
they had to run a bunch of builds to go

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
pool that

60
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,420
code from all the different locations

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,640
right pull it into some central location

62
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,080
then actually do all of the builds that

63
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,700
they needed to do and that was hugely

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,500
complicated because every team did

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,879
different stuff right so you had

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,480
different tools different capabilities

67
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,819
it was a multi multi-hour Fandango to go

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,959
do it and what they ended up having to

69
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,580
do was about this is about about 10 000

70
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,319
builds a day

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,480
in order to to to create one working

72
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,800
version of the product

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,800
so they had a a a a

74
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,040
set of 20 between 20 and 40 build

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,620
servers uh the all in order to build

76
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,260
this product had to be the most

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,680
unbelievably powerful machines you could

78
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,420
possibly imagine as many cores as you

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,440
could possibly fit as much memory as you

80
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,599
could possibly fit it was just a

81
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,239
monolithic product

82
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,239
um and it it ten thousand builds a day

83
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,900
to have a nightly build of the product

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,060
which needed a team of people to run run

85
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,879
this

86
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,680
um so I I started working with them that

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,959
was the state they were in kind of when

88
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,480
I started working with them and and my

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,760
my overriding advice was you need to

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,860
simplify this process you need to make

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,720
it easier faster slick because it's just

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,360
too hard to find out something's wrong

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,180
to find out you've broken something and

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,440
one team breaks another team right all

95
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,379
of those things

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,560
so I did a a state of agile state of

97
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:08,459
devops report for them which is

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,200
basically uh um here's the here's what

99
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,080
did I how did I phrase it here are the

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,580
opportunities for improvement right

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,260
um that you have in your system and if

102
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,359
you only fix three things here's the top

103
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,040
three things right and the top one was

104
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,740
that that build problem get them all

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,100
into one source control system uh one

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,560
set of builds and those kind of things

107
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,320
and that effort because they've got to

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,020
go do it right I'm the consultant I'm

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,220
there to help them do it and I also help

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,160
them with a whole bunch of other stuff

111
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,259
as well right but

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,180
um day to day they're the ones that have

113
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,160
got to go do it I don't understand their

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,479
code I don't know where all the bodies

115
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,340
are buried and who they need to

116
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,680
politically talk to in their company to

117
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,300
get stuff done they need to go do all of

118
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,820
that so I was there a little bit of

119
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,500
coaching uh mostly Consulting on other

120
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,639
stuff while they're doing that and then

121
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,020
coming back around and having

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,660
discussions and being part of me all

123
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,180
that kind of stuff and it actually took

124
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,340
and this was a record in this company

125
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,040
four years

126
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,020
uh to get them onto One Source control

127
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,180
system which was team Foundation we got

128
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,580
them all into Azure devops One Source

129
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,639
control system all on team Foundation

130
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,500
version control everything on one set of

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,199
branches and everybody working in the

132
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,139
same uh the same area so they'll be able

133
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,780
to clone the same clone uh uh um what

134
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,259
was it called create the same workspace

135
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,120
uh in tfvc and I'll work together and

136
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,160
not poop on each other still had lots of

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
branches still had 80 90 active branches

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,740
but at least they were all related to

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
each other and you could do the

140
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,199
branching and merging properly and all

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,340
that kind of stuff

142
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,560
and um but that was the first stage to

143
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,560
getting them onto uh getting them over

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,340
onto git optimizing their processes you

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,120
know

146
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,940
um

147
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,720
doing all of the other things that need

148
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,120
to happen in order to have uh I I

149
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,680
there's a phrase I love it it's called

150
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,300
onees

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
if you've not heard this phrase one

152
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,060
engineering system it's from uh first

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,000
time I heard it was from Microsoft and

154
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,160
they're one es strategy is part of the

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
reason that Azure devops exists in the

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,060
first place and that it's a cloud

157
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:22,319
platform and that's that they had this

158
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,060
problem internally and they wanted to

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,759
you don't want

160
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,160
an A person who works for you

161
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,780
to go work from one team and they move

162
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,400
to another team and suddenly have they

163
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,560
have to re-figure out how everything

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,180
works they have to re-figure out where

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
to store their work items they have to

166
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,139
where all the work requests are how they

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,880
build their code where they build their

168
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,039
code where the code comes from all of

169
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,900
that stuff shouldn't be that should be

170
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,880
like that's the default stuff that we

171
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,160
all understand

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,139
and then the actual build that happens

173
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,880
is different for every product in every

174
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,220
platform but it's in the same place

175
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,160
right between those lines is different

176
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,440
but the wrapper the how you get it to

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,759
done how what you need to install all of

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,880
those things should be part of the the

179
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,740
organizational standards and that's what

180
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,300
one engineering system was all about was

181
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,360
getting everybody onto one platform

182
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,479
everybody onto one not way of working

183
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,639
that's the wrong phrase but one

184
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,280
engineering system

185
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,039
that can do all of the things that

186
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,139
everybody in the company needed to do

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,060
so that nobody's confused about where
