The process was intricate, to say the least, and was crying out for simplification.&nbsp; üîß</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-nbsp-introduction-of-agile-and-devops\">3. &nbsp;Introduction of Agile and DevOps</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>My journey with this client started at this high point of complexity. &nbsp;My initial advice to this hardworking team was simple: restructure their processes. &nbsp;I proposed a simplified, streamlined process. &nbsp;I nudged them towards making their process easier, faster, and slicker.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To pinpoint the areas in need of improvement and to find a way to make it faster, easier, and less convoluted, as well as provide clarity, I curated a 'State of Agile and DevOps' report.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This report spotlighted their 'opportunities for improvement,' with their complex build problem taking the top spot.&nbsp;

However, I was there to consult, and they were the ones who had to get their hands dirty.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>They were in the driver's seat, understanding their code, the intricacies of their work culture, and the hurdles they needed to jump to bring about a change and set them straight on the path to transformation.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>And boy, did they rise to the occasion!&nbsp;

üéØ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-nbsp-building-towards-one-engineering-system\">6. &nbsp;Building Towards 'One Engineering System'</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This transformation was only the first step towards migrating them onto GIT and optimising their processes further. &nbsp;The first hurdle they needed to cross.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The next mission?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To adopt the 'One Engineering System' concept, first coined by Microsoft. &nbsp;The idea was to create a system that allowed everyone to use the same basic procedures, even while the specific details of each product varied.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We needed to ensure everyone was on the same platform.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-7-nbsp-azure-devops-is-a-key-player\">7. &nbsp;Azure DevOps is a Key Player</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Azure DevOps became the unsung hero in our journey and this is precisely why I love Azure DevOps so much.&nbsp; This tool perfectly embodies and captures the essence of the 'One ES' philosophy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It makes collaboration seamless, minimises confusion, and increases efficiency levels.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Again, this is why I love Azure DevOps and why it's my go-to tool.&nbsp;
