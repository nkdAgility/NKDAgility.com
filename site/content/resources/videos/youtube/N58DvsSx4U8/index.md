# What is your favourite DevOps consulting outcome?

After years as an #agilepractitioner, #softwaredeveloper and #devops specialist, Martin Hinshelwood evolved into a professional #agilecoach and #agileconsultant with a specialism in DevOps consulting.

It's an area where many #agileconsultants and #agilecoaches don't have much experience or expertise, so as a member of a small, elite group of DevOps consultants, Martin has significant experience across a wide variety of Devops applications, industries, and geographies.

In this short video, Martin talks about his favourite #devops #consulting outcome.
