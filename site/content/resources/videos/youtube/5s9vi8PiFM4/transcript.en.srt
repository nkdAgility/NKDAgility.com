1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,340
the one thing I really wish that I knew

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,500
understood or was exposed to at the

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,340
beginning of my scrum Journey was also

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,719
having a lean Journey a lean story as

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,080
well

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,600
um I didn't get encounter lean until

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,760
about seven eight years into my scrum

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,039
story and I

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,880
took me that long to really truly

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,099
understand how it changed the dynamic

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,120
scrum is the social technology that

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,600
helps us work together more effectively

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,640
lean is the the the data and

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,219
understanding of how we're doing that

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,700
thing that enables us to be even more

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,700
successful
