1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:08,040
one of one of the main ideas that we're

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,340
trying to get across Is this different

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,900
sort of working that is based on

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,719
complexity

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,199
right the work that we're doing has a

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,240
really high variance of of of of of of

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,760
of

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,619
time which makes it incredibly complex

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,160
we're doing things that have never been

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:34,620
done before and I feel like Lego is

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,260
completely the opposite of that like

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,820
Lego bricks fit together

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,340
I don't know if you've ever built

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,899
software but trying to get two bits of

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,620
software that were built independently

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:51,140
to fit together is an absolute nightmare

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,140
Lego trivializes that story
