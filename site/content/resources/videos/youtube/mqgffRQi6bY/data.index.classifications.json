However, it does not explicitly mention Scrum roles, events, or artifacts, which limits the direct mentions score. The conceptual alignment is moderate as it hints at the complexities faced in Scrum projects but lacks a thorough exploration of Scrum principles. The depth of discussion is somewhat higher due to the personal insights shared about the challenges of integrating software, but it does not delve into Scrum practices or frameworks.",
