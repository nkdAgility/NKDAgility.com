One of one of the main ideas that we're trying to get across is this different sort of working that is based on complexity. Right, the work that we're doing has a really high variance of time, which makes it incredibly complex. We're doing things that have never been done before, and I feel like Lego is completely the opposite of that. Like, Lego bricks fit together. I don't know if you've ever built software, but trying to get two bits of software that were built independently to fit together is an absolute nightmare. Lego trivializes that story.
