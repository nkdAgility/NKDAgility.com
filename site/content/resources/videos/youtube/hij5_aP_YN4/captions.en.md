To be an awesome agile coach, you really need to be part of a community, especially a community that doesn't just listen to you or doesn't just have the same ideas as you. You don't want to be in an echo chamber; you want to be in a group of people that are going to challenge the way you think, challenge the choices that you've made. That's going to say, "No, what you've done is not good enough." In order to be effective at agile and to help you realise and grow your experience to be able to deliver the most value to your customer.
