    "reasoning": "The content never explicitly references Service Level Expectation (SLE) or its calculation methods per Agile/Scrum/Kanban sources. Instead, the main focus is on replacing traditional estimation with probabilistic forecasting based on historical data and delivering with an expressed confidence percentage, such as 85%. While this probabilistic approach is conceptually adjacent to how SLE is calculated and used (i.e., forecasting delivery based on probabilities and cycle times), there is no direct mention or guidance about SLE as defined in the category. There are no references to Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams, nor to SLE's range-probability construct. The depth is limited to general ideas around forecasting and confidence, with no substantive discussion of SLE specifics. The intent is informative and could be useful for similar practitioner audiences, hence the higher audience alignment and signal-to-noise scores, but the content doesn't target SLE as defined. There are no penalties applied, as the tone is modern and there is no contradiction or outdated advice. The confidence score is therefore low, primarily due to the lack of direct mention, limited conceptual alignment, and surface-level depth regarding the strict SLE definition.",
