1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,280
one of the big struggles within the

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:11,000
context of software projects is

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,599
estimation um most organizations try and

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,960
do some form of estimation either

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,800
they're using um absolute estimation so

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,160
we're we're talking errors here um or

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,039
they're using some kind kind of relative

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,039
estimation tool it's really difficult

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,720
because we feel like we need estimates

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,800
to understand what we're going to do we

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,399
actually

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
don't

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,600
but what we do

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,199
need is the ability to forecast out into

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:49,320
the future with some kind of probability

16
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:52,440
right so the the

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,239
the when we're talking about software

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,680
delivery where we have really high

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,440
variance it's still really difficult

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,680
there is there is no tool when you have

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,640
more than 50%

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,960
unknown that you can use to accurately

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,080
predict the future right accuracy is is

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
not a thing you can have so what's the

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
best we can get right we want to be

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
looking at probabil abilities and

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,960
probabilistic

28
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,439
forecasting so what we tend to do is use

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,520
some kind of

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,759
forecasting simulation tool to look

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,600
forward into the future based B on what

32
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,680
actually happened so we're never

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,000
actually effectively estimating an

34
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,759
individual item within our backlog we're

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
just saying that we can deliver let's

36
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,040
say in the next 30 days we'll deliver

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,600
another 50 items with a with a

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,880
85% likelihood that that's going to

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,479
happen that leaves wiggle room for

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,880
things not happening the way you think

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,840
and it doesn't require the people on

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,360
your teams to spend spend a significant

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,520
amount of time estimating it doesn't

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,640
require any actual numbers to come out

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,160
of the team it still

46
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,760
requires the people doing the work to

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,720
analyze the work and break it down into

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,680
smaller chunks right that's reducing the

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,720
batch size of each individual item that

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,040
is still required that is something you

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,879
want to spend time on because it builds

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,440
understanding within the context of what

53
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,720
it is that we're delivering in right we

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,200
want to understand the thing we're

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,400
delivering and that understanding is the

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,280
main

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:48,080
impactor of our ability to execute on

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,159
those things so in in this new new world

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
there isn't really estimation but we

60
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,159
still have confidence and we put an

61
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,519
actual probability on our confidence I

62
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,519
usually encourage teams and departments

63
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,920
and organizations to look at about an

64
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:08,200
85% confidence level um being that what

65
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,920
70% of all startups fail so probably

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,599
relates a little bit to 70% of all ideas

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,879
are going to be unsuccessful right so

68
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,760
what's your confidence level of being

69
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,400
able to deliver as long as it's higher

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,599
than 70% it's probably a good bet and we

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,599
can figure it out from there
