    "description": "Estimation in Software Projects: Why Probabilistic Forecasting is Better | Martin Hinshelwood\n\nðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from NKD Agility, and in this video, I tackle one of the biggest challenges in software projects: estimation. Traditional estimation methods, whether absolute (hours) or relative (story points), often fall short in high-variance environments. Instead, Iâ€™ll explain how probabilistic forecasting can give you confidence and clarity without wasting time on inaccurate estimates.\n\nðŸ“Œ Chapters:\n\n1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: Why Estimation is a Struggle in Software Projects\n2. 02:30 â€“ The Problem with Absolute and Relative Estimation\n3. 05:15 â€“ Understanding Variance and Why Accuracy Isnâ€™t Possible\n4. 08:00 â€“ The Power of Probabilistic Forecasting\n5. 11:15 â€“ How to Use Historical Data for Forecasting\n6. 14:30 â€“ Building Confidence with Probability (85% Confidence Level)\n7. 17:00 â€“ Reducing Batch Sizes to Improve Understanding\n\nðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:\n\nâ€¢ Product managers and project managers tired of unreliable estimates\nâ€¢ Agile teams looking for better ways to plan and deliver work\nâ€¢ Organizations struggling with high-variance environments and unpredictable timelines\nâ€¢ Leaders seeking practical tools to improve confidence in delivery timelines\n\nðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:\n\nâ€¢ Why traditional estimation methods often fail in software projects\nâ€¢ How probabilistic forecasting works and why itâ€™s more reliable\nâ€¢ The importance of analyzing and breaking down work to reduce batch sizes\nâ€¢ How to use confidence levels (e.g., 85%) to set realistic expectations\nâ€¢ Why understanding work is more important than estimating it\n\nðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:\n\nâ€¢ Accurate estimation is impossible in high-variance environmentsâ€”focus on probabilities instead.\nâ€¢ Probabilistic forecasting uses historical data to predict outcomes with confidence.\nâ€¢ Reducing batch sizes and understanding work leads to better execution.\nâ€¢ Aim for an 85% confidence level to balance risk and realism in your forecasts.\n\n\nAt NKD Agility, we help teams and organizations embrace modern forecasting techniques like probabilistic forecasting to deliver with confidence.
