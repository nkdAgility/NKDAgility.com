1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,080
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,040
apocalypse is chaos chaos oh my chaos is

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,960
everywhere in teams um it manifests as

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,359
not having a plan of not knowing which

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,320
way we're going not having goals and

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,760
what would you expect when everybody

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
doesn't have the same goal this they're

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,080
not working together towards a common

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,160
goal you end up with chaos everybody's

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,320
pulling in different directions and this

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,520
applies not just just at the team level

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,520
but all the way up your organization why

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,160
would you think everybody would be going

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,000
in the same direction if they don't all

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,879
understand the goals of the organization

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,600
the goals of the product and how the

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,079
work that they do every day contributes

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,079
to those goals
