The discussion of flow metrics is generic and does not situate WIP limits in the context of SLE or touch upon establishing or communicating an SLE. While Kanban and Scrum vocabularies are present, any overlap with SLE is indirect at best (as both rely on flow concepts), and the main thrust is optimizing WIP, not service level predictability. Thus, the scores for direct mentions, alignment, depth, and intent are very low—assigned fractionally above zero only to acknowledge a distant conceptual adjacency, but not actual SLE content. The audience and signal scores are slightly higher because practitioners interested in SLE might plausibly encounter this content during workflow improvement efforts, but almost none of the material is relevant to SLE itself.",
