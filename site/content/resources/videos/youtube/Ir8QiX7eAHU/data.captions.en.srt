1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,879
one of the key components of creating a

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,760
cand strategy is whip limits if you

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,679
don't have whip limits it's definitely

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,400
not a cand strategy that you have so

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,039
when you when you visualize your work

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
when you do that Workshop where you

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,160
figure out what are the the the the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,199
columns the states the activities that

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,800
happen for any piece of work that flows

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,800
through our system and you create those

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,720
columns you're going to have to decide

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,239
what your whipit is in each of those

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,399
areas is and coming up uh uh with a whip

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,440
limit is a little bit of an art right

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,200
it's like

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,079
um coming up with what's the what's the

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,600
goldilock zone for this particular

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,000
activity and I actually found out that I

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,719
I really fundamentally thought that

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Goldilocks and the Three Bears was a

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,879
completely

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,160
ubiquitous uh story um but I was working

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,079
recently with a group in Romania and

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,800
they don't have Goldilocks and the three

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,320
bearss as a bedtime story it's not a not

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,439
a not a not a thing uh so kind of what

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,119
we're talking about and actually this

28
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,159
was the bit that resonated the best for

29
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:17,479
them was um think of what they describe

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,119
of as the goldilock Zone in planetary

31
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,400
physics I know I'm sounding like a

32
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,439
nutball here right but bear with me um

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,560
in in in planets when they talk about

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
planets being in the goldilock zone they

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,119
mean it's between water freezing and

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,640
water boiling right so you can have life

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,040
when there's water but you can't have

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,000
life when it's steam or in general

39
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,000
that's where

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,320
they yes I know that's possible but

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,680
let's you've got that that that that

42
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,040
zone if the water's frozen it's probably

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
very difficult to have life if the

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,600
waterers steam then it's very difficult

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,600
to have life so what is the Zone within

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,920
which it's just right that's the

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,000
goldilux zone you can go look up the

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,799
story The Fable later right but the

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,800
idea is that um we need to figure out

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,520
not just our whip limit for the whole

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,640
system but are whip limit for individual

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,239
stages in the system and the whip limit

53
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,840
for the individual stages if we create

54
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,480
individual stages will probably inform

55
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,760
the whip limit for the overall system

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,879
right because you just add them up and

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,519
that's the whip limit for the whole

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,360
system so um the ideal whip limit right

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,959
there is an ideal whip limit if

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,760
everything is perfect the ideal whip

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,080
limit is one the most optimal whip limit

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:43,360
um in a in in um flow is one single

63
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,440
piece flow right but that only works

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,959
when our

65
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,840
um that only works when our system is

66
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,760
perfect when it operates exactly like we

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
expect in the timing we expect when all

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,680
of those things are absolutely perfect

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,400
in the whip limit is one uh the the the

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,760
the thing I usually use to visualize

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,000
that is I I do the an a version of the

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,319
coin game with teams if you've not done

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,840
the coin game it's a great H exercise

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,400
where um you give people you give a

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,680
group of people uh 20 coins they flip

76
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,360
them all to heads and then they it's

77
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,959
it's a batch size exercise right so they

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
um flip them all to heads and then they

79
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,799
have to flip them all to Tails pass to

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,439
the next person they have to flip them

81
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,360
all to Tails pass them to the next

82
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,280
person so you've got this simulation of

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,120
a production line right something

84
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,640
happens in this stage the next stage

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,760
happens something happens there next

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,959
stage and in an ideal world you just

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,640
want one flip the coin move it on flip

88
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,360
the coin move it on flip the coin move

89
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,840
it on and you'll

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,519
have the maximum number of coins

91
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,560
going in action at any point in time

92
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,640
does that make sense right you've got if

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,159
you do batch size of 20 and you've get

94
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,319
20 coins and you've got 10 people in a

95
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,639
row you've got one person working and

96
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,199
nine people

97
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,280
waiting at all all the time the whole

98
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,320
time if you do a batch size of one

99
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,440
you've got 10 people

100
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,240
working and you'll get the fastest

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,120
delivery of the first unit of work and

102
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,479
the fastest delivery of mult of all the

103
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,199
units of work work okay but the world

104
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,759
isn't made up of flipping coins right

105
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,960
we're not that's not what we're doing

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,199
all day we are writing code we're

107
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,840
solving problems we're painting pictures

108
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,840
we're uh waiting on customers to reply

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,039
there's all sorts of things that make

110
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,199
what we do non a nonlinear thing not a

111
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,120
thing that just happens at once so

112
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,160
you're going to have to figure out for

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,240
each of those columns

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,000
what the most optimal whip limit is

115
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,440
based on your ability to keep things

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,880
moving and the need to identify when

117
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,120
there's problems if we make the whip

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,600
limit 100 in every column it's going to

119
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,199
be difficult to identify problems

120
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,120
because we'll maybe never hit it we'll

121
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,280
never hit the whip limit we deliberately

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,160
want to constrain the work to slightly

123
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,080
less than we can do so that we create

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,880
slack in the system that enables us to

125
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,039
see more of what's going on ask more

126
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
interesting questions and figure out do

127
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,000
we need to increase this or reduce this

128
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,319
one those are the types of discussions

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,199
that we want to have um and whenever we

130
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,360
run workshops where we run simulations

131
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,960
around this that's the kind of

132
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,199
conversations that people have in the

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,000
groups is who should we create the whip

134
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,280
limit bigger yeah but if we create the

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,360
whip limit bigger then there'll be more

136
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,520
stuff in here and there'll be more

137
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,680
pressure on this part of the system the

138
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,000
people in the groups are then a they're

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,039
able to visualize those things and see

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,639
the impact of those things which is the

141
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,240
whole point of a cand strategy that

142
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,520
everybody in the

143
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,639
system understands the system that

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,440
you've created better and it allows them

145
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,639
all to have more rational more

146
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
interesting conversations about how the

147
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,960
system goes together and how we might

148
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,120
change it in order to improve it or or

149
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
attempt to improve it and then the

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,960
impact of those improvements you're able

151
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,120
to monitor them at that that is

152
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,880
really picking whip limits just make up

153
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,880
some numbers at the start pick stuff and

154
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,759
see what works increase them if they're

155
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,960
too small make

156
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,759
them smaller if they're too big and

157
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,720
figure out where that optimal level is

158
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,440
um if you're really searching for Martin

159
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,560
what would you recommend as our whip

160
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,120
limit I I would say in any

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,520
stage as a starting point if you have to

162
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,120
have a Martin says we should do it this

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,319
way if you have to have that uh then

164
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,319
pick one less than the number of people

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,800
that you have performing an activity in

166
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,400
that in that area so if you have four

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,520
people pick three as your whip limit and

168
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,840
see how you go if you're struggling to

169
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,000
create whip limits so that you can see

170
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,000
what's going on in your system then we

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,840
can help you we provide world class

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,599
class cran training from Pro cran as

173
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,160
well as Consulting and coaching for

174
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,840
teams try to implement caman strategy if

175
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,199
you're a scrum team then we always

176
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,520
recommend bringing in flow metrics as a

177
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:45,000
complimentary practice and also have

178
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,000
caman classes from scrum.org
