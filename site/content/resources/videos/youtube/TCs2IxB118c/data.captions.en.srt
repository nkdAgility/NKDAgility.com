1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,240
I don't know if you've

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,480
noticed but unhappy sad people tend not

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,000
to be engaged in what it is that they're

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,679
doing and one of

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,359
the E metrics for whether you're going

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,199
to have success in the future is the

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,640
morale of the people that are doing the

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,880
work that could be could be people

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,599
actually building the products it could

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
be the people designing the products it

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,199
could be the people managing the people

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
people that are designing the products

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,040
if if if we're sad and unhappy we don't

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,879
do good work as humans no matter how

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,559
much you encourage them to just be

16
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,160
professionals and get on with it so we

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,960
want Happy engaged excited people and

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,559
and part of what

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,879
makes us as humans happy and engaged and

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,239
excited about topics is if we have our

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,600
intrinsic needs met so hopefully

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
hopefully you're paying people enough in

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,960
your organization that they're not

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,400
worried about extrinsic needs right like

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,080
the paying the mortgage or the rent or

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,200
putting food on the table right th those

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
those are things that hopefully the

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,040
people within your organization are are

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,200
already a to achieve which means if if

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:28,119
ER you've read uh Dan Pink's book drive

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,400
um the intrinsic motivators that really

32
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,360
encourage us to do the best work work we

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,560
can or autonomy Mastery in

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,040
purpose

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,759
and autonomy

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,399
being us feeling like we're in control

37
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,360
of Our Own Destiny and we decide what

38
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,200
we're working on um Mastery means we're

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,119
we're good at what we are do what we are

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:57,520
do we're good at what we do we're being

41
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,640
um valuable right we're learning and

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,719
understanding and then uh purpose

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
right we the things that we do matter to

44
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,599
to others they provide value in the

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
space and we can see the value that

46
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,000
those things

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,560
create

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,680
so part of the thing that I think is

49
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:26,680
most valuable about this idea of the

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,400
longer term um mentor and training

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,160
immersive

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,080
programs is that that

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
because we're provoking discussion

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,080
within the

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,560
organization right we're provoking

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,680
thought leadership within the

57
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,760
organization I found that the people

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,159
within the organization start becoming

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,800
more engaged and animated in the the

60
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,159
particular topics right they start

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
talking to other people in the

62
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,360
organization about the things that

63
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
they've been not just the things they've

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,599
been learning but the things they've

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,799
been discing discussing the things have

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,519
been discovering they start H figuring

67
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,760
out who in the organization can I go

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,879
speak to to have a a conversation on

69
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,720
this particular topic they're starting

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,720
to get engaged and excited and animated

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,879
about what it is that they're trying to

72
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,519
do because they're starting to see how

73
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,239
the work they do every day connects to

74
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,200
the overall purpose of the organization

75
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,360
even if the organization doesn't yet

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,560
understand the purpose that it's trying

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,480
to achieve so lots of organizations

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,400
don't have that that overriding goal

79
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,280
that North Star that they're working

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,360
towards um are working with a few

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
organizations at the moment that H the

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,519
leadership hasn't even thought about

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
that oh to make more money right which

84
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,080
is which is not what everybody can get

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,239
behind because it's making somebody else

86
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,840
money but the

87
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,159
the

88
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,360
even knowing especially this is

89
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,120
especially true for the product

90
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,879
management Mentor program the things we

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,959
talk about helps those FKS understand

92
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,319
the need for those things so their

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,360
initial purpose becomes how do I engage

94
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,439
with my organization and help them

95
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,200
create that that those those those goals

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,639
and vision that that that this is what

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,880
we're trying to achieve that North Star

98
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,360
and in not the current the I've got a

99
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,759
current um Mentor program that's

100
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,960
underway for for product management but

101
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,360
I had a a previous previous one that

102
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
ended perhaps two months ago something

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
like that

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:39,199
um for an organization in the UK and

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,840
about halfway through the program I got

106
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,800
an email from the

107
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,320
CEO uh effectively

108
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,520
saying I I I

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,759
I've not an exact quote but to

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,960
paraphrase what he said he said I i'

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,120
I've I've

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
never had a training program that we've

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,000
purchased as an organization cuz it was

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
sold as a training program never had a

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
training program that we've purchased as

116
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,080
an organization provide the level of

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Engagement and

118
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,320
excitement and potential

119
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:21,360
change than the mentor program did for

120
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,400
for product managers so it it it

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,880
highlighted it was highlighted to him

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,600
because um effectively one of one of the

123
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,000
weeks everybody was in Poland

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,280
so from a time scale perspective I think

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,199
it was afternoon

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,960
session um so in Poland it's like two

127
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,440
hours two hours later is it two hours

128
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,880
later or is it 3 hours later not Poland

129
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,039
Romania was Romania I think it was so

130
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:57,360
it's it's like two hours two hours later

131
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,199
and um so the product managers had had

132
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,160
their day in the organization then

133
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,360
they'd had this class into the evening

134
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,800
so I take four hours of their time into

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,599
the evening and then there was a dinner

136
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,120
organized with the CEO and all the

137
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,680
product managers and some other folks

138
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,840
and the product man the the CEO was

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,599
expecting all the product managers to

140
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,520
turn up tired and grumpy and you know

141
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:25,440
all of those things that you expect when

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,039
oh they've just spent four hours doing

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,199
this thing they've probably been in a

144
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,599
PowerPoint presentation for 4 hours and

145
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,800
they'll be tired and grumpy but when

146
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,199
they came to the dinner they were

147
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,160
engaged in talking about the topics that

148
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,080
we'd been talking about during the day

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
they were engaging the CEO in

150
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
discussions about what it is that they

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
would like to try and do how it's

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,440
different from what they've done before

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,280
how it might impact on the value that we

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,280
create in the

155
00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:00,840
organization that engagement and

156
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:03,120
excitement was enough to prompt the CEO

157
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,080
to email me directly and say well this

158
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,479
was this was great this was great I've

159
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,960
never seen this before this is this is

160
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:14,400
fantastic and that obviously for me is a

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,520
great outcome as well um and we've

162
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,599
actually done follow on mentorship

163
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,639
programs for their engineering teams as

164
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,800
well where um we've taken their

165
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,759
engineering teams into a similar type of

166
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,960
program same same model uh we did a 10we

167
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,400
uh uh product development Mentor program

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,479
uh with two of their four teams in the

169
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,080
organization and we've already started

170
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,240
to see Improvement in the teams

171
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,319
Improvement and what it is that they're

172
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,319
they're they're doing in the

173
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,120
organization and their ability to

174
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,280
deliver and support the business

175
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,720
so I've

176
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,319
seen way more instances of success with

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,479
this type of format than I ever saw

178
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,560
before um with uh uh the traditional

179
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,120
training uh uh four half days or two

180
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,919
full day format that has been delivered

181
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,400
in the past um I've really only seen

182
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:16,919
that work once really successfully in

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,879
hundreds of trainings um at least I've

184
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,440
seen it right that doesn't mean it's not

185
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,120
been successful for people um but me

186
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,520
being able to see and engage with this

187
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,879
group of people over um 8 to 15 weeks or

188
