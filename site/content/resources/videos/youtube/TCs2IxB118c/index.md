# The Power of Engaged Teams Through Mentorship Programs

Introduction: The Impact of Morale on Success

- Unhappy Teams Struggle: If your team is unhappy and disengaged, their work suffers, no matter how much you push for professionalism.
- Key to Success: High morale is a leading indicator of future success, whether itâ€™s the product designers, builders, or managers.

ðŸŒŸ Creating Happy, Engaged, and Motivated Teams

- Meeting Intrinsic Needs: Beyond just paying your team well enough to cover their basic needs, you need to focus on intrinsic motivators:
  - Autonomy: Allowing control over their work.
  - Mastery: Ensuring theyâ€™re good at what they do and continually learning.
  - Purpose: Connecting their work to a greater cause or value.

ðŸš€ The Value of Long-Term Mentorship Programs

- Provoking Thought Leadership: Long-term, immersive mentorship programs encourage discussions within the organization, sparking thought leadership.
- Increased Engagement: As people discuss, learn, and discover more, they become more animated and excited about their roles and the organizationâ€™s goals.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Success Stories

- Transforming Product Management: In one mentorship program with a UK organization, the CEO noticed unprecedented engagement and excitement among the product managers after the sessions.
  - Unexpected Outcomes: Despite long days, the product managers were energized and eager to discuss their learnings, impressing the CEO.
  - Expansion to Engineering Teams: The success led to similar programs for engineering teams, which have already shown improvements in delivery and support.

ðŸ“ˆ Why Traditional Training Falls Short

- Limited Impact of Short Sessions: Traditional half-day or two-day training sessions rarely produce the same level of sustained engagement or results.
- Continuous Learning is Key: Extended mentorship over 8 to 15 weeks consistently produces actionable outcomes and deeper engagement, proving far more effective.
