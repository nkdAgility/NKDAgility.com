 🧪 Don’t Test Quality In—Build It In From the Start
🎥 Episode 6 of 10 — From Legacy to Engineering Excellence with Azure DevOps

Too many teams are still testing quality in—not building it in.
And by the time bugs surface in QA or production?
It’s already too late—and too expensive to fix.

📉 Every delay in catching issues = rework, friction, and missed opportunities.
Manual QA isn’t enough. Long-running regression tests aren’t enough.
You need feedback fast. You need quality engineered in.

At NKD Agility, we help teams shift quality left using:
✅ TDD (as a design practice—not just a test strategy)
✅ Static analysis you can scale gradually
✅ Automated policies, pull request gates, and AI-driven code checks
✅ CI/CD pipelines that prevent “bug ping-pong” between testers and devs

💡 The goal?
→ Shorten your feedback loops
→ Catch issues at the developer level
→ Build testable, maintainable code from the start

🚀 From 48-hour test cycles to 3-minute unit test runs, Azure DevOps is built by teams that made this shift—and it enables you to do the same.
