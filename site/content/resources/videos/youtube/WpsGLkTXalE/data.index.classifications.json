While these are all relevant to Agile practices generally, there are no direct or indirect references to Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, application, or role in predictability, nor does it mention key components like elapsed time range, probability, or the mathematical/analytic foundations specified in the SLE definition. The text does not touch on forecast metrics, time to completion, or reference any authoritative SLE sources. It is aimed at Agile practitioners and team leads (audience alignment is slightly higher as the target overlaps), and signal-to-noise is moderate since most content is about Agile team culture and trust. Scoring is accordingly very low on direct mentions, conceptual alignment, and depth. No penalties were required as the content is current and not satirical or critical of SLE.",
