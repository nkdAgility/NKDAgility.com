One of the key elements of Caman is improving, making improvements or changes to the system in order to see whether you've managed to improve things or not. So we use metrics and visual tools to enable us as humans to see patterns and understand the data to increase transparency, so that we can make changes to the system. 

This allows us to ask more interesting questions of ourselves and others that participate in our system. Improving the workflow is absolutely critical. If you're not making changes to your workflow on a continuous basis, you're probably not doing Caman. 

If you are making changes, are you looking at the right data? Do you have the right visualisations to really be seeing what's going on?
