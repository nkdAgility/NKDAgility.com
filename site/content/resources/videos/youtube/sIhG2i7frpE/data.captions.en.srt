00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,720
one of the key elements of caman is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,680
improving making improvements or changes

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,840
to the system in order to see whether

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,039
you've manage to improve things or not

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:19,279
so we use metrics and visual tools to

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,920
enable us as humans to see patterns and

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,960
understand the data to increase

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,119
transparency so that we can make changes

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,840
to the system so that we can ask more

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,519
interesting questions of ourselves and

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,640
others that participate in our system so

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,719
improving the workflow is absolutely

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,399
critical if you're not making changes to

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,800
your workflow on a continuous basis

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,160
you're probably not doing caman if you

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,360
are making changes are you looking at

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
the right data do you have the right

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,760
visualizations to really be seeing

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,760
what's going on
