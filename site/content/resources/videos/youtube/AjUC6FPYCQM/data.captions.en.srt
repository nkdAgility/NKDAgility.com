1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,260
so the question is do teams really

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,540
understand the power of applying scrum

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,719
professionally

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,680
this is a really hard one because I I

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,740
or contentious one because I don't think

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,140
that most teams I've ever worked with at

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,240
like professionals they act like

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,039
amateurs

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,140
um and that's not necessarily their

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,520
fault there's not a not a not a blame

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,340
there

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,980
um it's just how companies expect they

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,219
don't seem to

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,140
expect us to be professionals and do the

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,780
right thing they want us to do their

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,960
thing at whatever speed they want us to

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,940
do it at which means that we are as

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
Engineers as a software engineer for

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,699
many years we're encouraged to do things

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,559
the easy fast cheap way

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,420
not the right way

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,280
and that encourages unprofessional

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,500
behavior it supports unprofessional

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,560
behavior

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,540
so most most teams don't necessarily

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,479
understand what what professional

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,920
Behavior looks like even even to the

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,840
level of

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,400
um I worked with an organization a few

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,500
years ago and we did an exercise on what

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,180
requirements should look like

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,280
for the engineering team to take them on

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,900
so this was this was not the engineering

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,720
teams themselves this was the the

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,180
product management group

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,880
um and we did this exercise where where

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,380
I I love it get everybody in a room uh

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,119
break them into groups cross-functional

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,280
groups and then they have to take some

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,560
user interface from their product and

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,720
break down what the requirements they

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,240
would have liked to have

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,460
with hindsight right so they they build

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
these lovely detailed requirements and

45
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,240
how much detail and all the questions

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,040
they had to go ask and the stuff they

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,020
didn't know and they built all this

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,860
they're like holy moly that's a lot of

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,540
stuff

50
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,040
and then we started the second part of

51
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,560
the exercise which was take something

52
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,820
off their backlog that they don't that

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,619
they have right now that they haven't

54
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,360
built yet and do the same thing for it

55
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,459
right so they're they're trying to build

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,860
out these requirements and the head of

57
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,280
product management stopped us

58
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,700
stopped the whole whole whole workshop

59
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,060
and basically said that him and his team

60
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,420
um were not set up to be able

61
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,580
to do this just we're we're not

62
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,700
fundamentally capable

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,440
of creating and working with you to

64
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,920
build requirements of this level of

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,540
detail that we obviously now see this is

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,580
what you needed in the first place right

67
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,220
that we've never given you before

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,580
but we're not set up to do it that's

69
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,940
like a a moment of realization

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,739
that that professionalism is up here and

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,540
your capacity to deliver is down here

72
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,700
right this is where we need to be this

73
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,819
is where a professional product

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,400
management group is interacting

75
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,200
collaboratively with the team figuring

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,900
out what it is they need working up

77
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
front getting ahead of the the the curve

78
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,540
of the things that the teams need so

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,879
that everything's ready at the right

80
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,080
time and they just weren't ready for

81
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,080
that

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,540
and and I think that's that's true in

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,599
lots of parts of organizations not just

84
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,519
on teams and scrum teams and one of the

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,360
purposes of scrum

86
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,580
is to to make those things transparent

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,500
right you've got to try and do these

88
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,720
things that you're working one of the

89
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,300
minimum professional things that a team

90
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,180
any team if you have a software team

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,799
they absolutely should be able to create

92
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,900
usable working product every iteration

93
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
including the first that is production

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,700
ready

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,019
right that's like minimum bar for scrum

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,920
if you're not doing that if you don't

97
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,900
have that at the end of the Sprint

98
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,659
potentially shippable not ship

99
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,280
potentially shippable right it you're

100
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,900
not doing scrum yet you're just

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,280
fundamentally not at the level of

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,500
transparency that you need for a

103
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,420
professional scrum team and so many

104
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,519
teams look at that and go holy crap

105
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,439
we're so far away from that it's it's

106
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,140
it's it's it's insane

107
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,000
right that that is a hard place to be

108
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,340
and it's a hard realization not just for

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,560
the team because as the team tries to

110
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,440
get there they're going to realize all

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,540
the things they don't have right oh but

112
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,100
we don't we can't create production

113
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,440
ready because we've got a third party

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,960
testing team that comes in and and does

115
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,280
testing so how do we know that stuff

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,280
how do we know what they're going to

117
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,199
come up with or we submit it to oh what

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,720
did we used to do at Merrill Lynch

119
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,940
PWC it's also some company we used to

120
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,820
submit all of our websites to that would

121
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,520
then do a third-party penetration test

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,500
and we had no idea what tools they used

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,960
to do those painter they call it just

124
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,000
the pen testing cost 15 grand to do a

125
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,560
pen test and you would get an output of

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,479
stuff you need to go fix well it wasn't

127
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,240
done right the product that you created

128
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,360
wasn't at done wasn't ready wasn't

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,860
shippable quality because you you don't

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,060
understand those tools that they're

131
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,340
using you don't understand those

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,699
additional checks and you need to

133
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,940
so I I think

134
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:19,380
the power of applying scrum

135
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:22,919
professionally is understanding what it

136
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,800
takes to be professionals and create

137
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,440
have a professional work ethic where

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,240
we're creating something that our

139
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,520
customers can use that they can get

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,259
value from that they that they value

141
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,320
right

142
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:40,979
um and more most uh teams don't really

143
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,320
understand that until they start

144
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,360
and then they start to understand what

145
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,979
they don't know start to add more

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,900
capabilities in there and they

147
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,259
eventually get to to being professional

148
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,259
teams
