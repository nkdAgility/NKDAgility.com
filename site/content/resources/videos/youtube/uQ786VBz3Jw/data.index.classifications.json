    "reasoning": "The content focuses on core Agile practices, particularly Sprint planning, product backlog clarity, product goals, and teamwork. There are no direct or indirect mentions of agentic software delivery, AI agents, contextual intelligence, or the integration of automation and human expertise as described in the Agentic Software Delivery classification. The material is general Agile guidance, with no discussion of AI or agentic systems. The purpose is to inform about classic Agile principles rather than agentic themes. The audience is Agile or Scrum practitioners, partly overlapping but not directly targeting those exploring agentic delivery. Signal-to-noise ratio is modest; all content is on-topic for Agile, but none relates to agentic delivery. No evident obsolescence or critical tone, so no penalties are applied. Overall, the fit with this category is very low but not absolutely zero, as references to product backlog and goals could theoretically be extended in agentic contexts.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content discusses classic Agile/Sprint planning and team alignment, with no mention of autonomous agents, contextual AI, or agentic practices. The fit for Agentic Software Delivery is minimal as it lacks category-defining topics or intent.",
