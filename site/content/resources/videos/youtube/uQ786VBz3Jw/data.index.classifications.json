As a result, it lacks significant direct mentions, conceptual alignment, and depth concerning philosophical discussions, justifying a low confidence score.",

There is neither discussion of forecasting cycle times, the elapsed time range/probability components of SLE, nor any mention of flow metrics or Kanban-related predictors. All recommendations remain firmly within basic Scrum ceremonies and team alignment, not service predictability or flow analyses. The audience (Agile practitioners or Scrum teams) partially overlaps with the category’s, which slightly increases the audience alignment score, since SLE might be relevant to them in other contexts. Otherwise, there is almost no signal relevant to SLE, and no penalty is needed as there is no outdated information or misframing.
