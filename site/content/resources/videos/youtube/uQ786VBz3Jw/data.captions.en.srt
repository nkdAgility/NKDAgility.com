1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,980
so I guess I guess the number one tip

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,220
for Effective Sprint planning is make

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,740
sure everybody on your team

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,680
already understands

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,019
what's in the product backlog what's

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,019
likely

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,660
to be brought into the Sprint as much as

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,759
possible right there's all I put a lot

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,260
of caveats in there I did put a lot of

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,899
caveats in there did it deliberately

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,000
because again there could be surprises

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,980
there could be things you don't know

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,120
that you discovered during Sprint

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,239
planning

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,280
there could be all sorts of reasons why

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,239
you have to deviate from the happy path

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,219
but the happy path is uh that number one

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,579
thing for making you as effective as

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,940
possible is as much as as possible the

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,260
entire team should understand

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,059
the things that are in the product

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,420
backlog before they bring them into the

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,700
Sprint that would be my number one tip

24
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,840
for Sprint planning if I was to bring in

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:17,340
a number two tip which I'm gonna

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:20,520
uh then it would be that that have a

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,240
clear well understood product goal as

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,540
well

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,460
right what what is the context within

30
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,140
which we're making decisions that's

31
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,340
really the purpose of the product goal

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,320
right

33
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,600
um we're making making holistic

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,220
decisions during Sprint planning about

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,200
what direction we're going to take the

36
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,119
product in next

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
right and a clear understanding of the

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,140
product goal is key key to that

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,380
understanding uh it's key to being able

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,900
to effectively or make those choices as

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,460
effective as possible how do we make

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,140
more of the right choices less of the

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,860
wrong ones we need more understanding we

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:58,020
need more uh uh uh visibility and

45
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,140
transparency of the Strategic direction

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,360
of the product uh the current tactical

47
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,219
direction of the product

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,860
um or intermediate strategic Direction

49
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,280
which is the product goal but also

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,680
that's how we craft the Sprint goal

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,020
which is the next tactical thing we're

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,879
doing in order to reach our intermediate

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,400
strategic goal

54
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,440
um so having that that clear and make it

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,540
as transparent everybody on the team

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,220
needs to understand it product owner

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,500
needs to understand it

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,360
um and its impact stakeholders need to

59
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
understand it as well right otherwise

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,940
you're going to get to the end of the

61
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Sprint and you're gonna have unhappy

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,780
stakeholders because you went in the

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,400
direction that they didn't

64
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,140
didn't think you were going or didn't

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,540
understand you were going right

66
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,500
don't do that

67
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,260
um and if so yeah well uh if teams don't

68
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,860
or aren't able to

69
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,560
um

70
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,879
to do those two things uh they're pretty

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
they're pretty much

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,480
screwed you're not gonna build great

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,819
products right unless you actually

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,099
understand where you're going I I think

75
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:04,080
look everybody should be should should

76
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,120
look up team

77
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,379
in the dictionary everybody should have

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,080
to look up team in the dictionary right

79
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,140
it means a group of people working

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
together towards a common goal if

81
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:20,280
there's no common goal there is no team

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,980
if you have a a list if your Sprint goal

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,840
is a list of things you're not a team

84
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,819
you're just a group of people who pick

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,680
some stuff and happen to discuss it

86
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,640
together that's not a team you're not

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,599
working together towards a common goal

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,459
um so make sure that you you you have

89
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,500
Sprint goals

90
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,200
you have product goals and that they're

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,540
not just lists of things

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,319
right and make sure you have it at least

93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,819
for Sprint planning
