Oh, that's great. So that what is my feeling on creating agile apprenticeships? I think it's going to be the logical progression of the immersive story as well.

Um, and I feel like I do some of those things already. I have a number of people that have come through my training classes. That's kind of how I got introduced to them. 

That then just keep hanging out, right? That's, uh, um, I don't, I don't, um, how best to describe it? Like I've always, at least for a very long time, I provided this capability for students, for anybody on the internet, just to book a coffee with me, right? Or, uh, a free consultation, right? Whatever you want to call it, freak on stage that cost 30 minutes. 

But also for every training class, for every student, they get an extra 60 minutes of consulting time, right? And I think that lots of students don't use it. I think I worked it out the other day. I looked at the data and it was about less than five percent of people that come through the classes actually used the one hour of coaching consulting. 

So when, uh, for example, Rickard, who's a scrum master, and when he comes back and says, "Can I get another hour?" or "Can I get another hour?" or he phones me in the evening to talk about the cool stuff that he's been doing in the office and how it's impacted on his team and to ask some questions and "What do you think might be better?" or, um, you know, even just he's telling me about his awesome day, right? 

That interaction for me is hugely valuable because Rickard's getting more value, providing more value to his company, to his organisation because he's able to, you know, maybe serve some extra information or even just chat. You know, sometimes you just need to chat with somebody who might even not know anything about what you're talking about, right? But can provide you with a sounding board. 

And if it's somebody that, and that, that's that, that, um, internship idea, right? Or, um, that ability for those scrum masters to have somebody that they can come and talk to, to say, "Well, I tried this and it didn't work out. What am I doing wrong?" And it might be, "Well, you're not doing anything wrong," right? That could be the biggest value that they get from that conversation. 

You're not doing anything wrong. That's just the way it works. Here's something else you might want to try. 

So I think that, um, mentoring internship model I think is really important to people's learning. And I expect that off the iterative, the immersive type of training, that there'll be a lot more of that type of experience for people and people wanting more of that experience. 

So I'm actually really looking forward to that because I love having a chat and finding out how people are actually using the things that we're talking about and being successful at it. Because so many times, um, companies that call me in to help are only calling me in to help when things aren't going so well for them. 

So I don't see a lot of the successes, right? Because by the time those successes are generated, I'm already off to doing the next thing or working for the next company and they're implementing the ideas. But being able to have those follow-on conversations where somebody's actually implementing some of those ideas, trying stuff out, it's just awesome.
