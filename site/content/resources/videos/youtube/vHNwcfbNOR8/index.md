# What is your feeling on creating agile apprenticeships?

#scrum is notorious for being relatively straightforward to understand, yet incredibly difficult to master. Any #productdevelopment environment is going to be challenging due to the level of complexity involved, but working in such a new, progressive way can prove super tough for many.

Enter #agile #apprenticeships.

Why don't we have more of these in the #agile industry? Why don't we design and mentor apprenticeship programs that empower young people to thrive in the #productdevelopment and #projectmanagement industries?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through his thoughts and feelings around #agileapprenticeships, and why he thinks they are a great idea.
