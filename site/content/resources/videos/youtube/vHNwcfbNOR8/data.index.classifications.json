Instead, it focuses on personal experiences and aspirations related to mentoring and continuous learning. While the concepts of mentorship and continuous learning align with Agile principles, they do not provide concrete, actionable tenets as defined in the category context. The discussion is brief and lacks depth regarding the application of specific tenets.",
