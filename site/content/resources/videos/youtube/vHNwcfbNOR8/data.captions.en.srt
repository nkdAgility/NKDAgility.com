1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,880
oh that's great so that what is my

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,580
feeling on creating agile

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,920
apprenticeships I think it's going to be

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,740
the logical progression of the of of of

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,619
the immersive story as well

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,619
um and I feel like I do some of those

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,900
things already I have a number of uh

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,519
people that have come through my

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,740
training classes that's kind of how I

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,380
got introduced to them

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,160
that then then just keep hanging out

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,020
right that's that's uh um I don't I

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,780
don't

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,000
um how best to describe it like I I've

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,800
always at least for a very long time I

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,780
provided this capability for for

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,840
students for anybody on the internet

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,899
just to book a coffee with me right or

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,460
or uh uh a free consultation right

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,039
whatever you want to call it freak on

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,699
stage that cost 30 minutes and but also

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,840
for every training class for every

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,960
student

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,040
and they get an extra 60 Minutes of

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,280
Consulting time right and I think that

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,840
that lots of students don't use it I

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,780
think I worked it out the other day I

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,880
looked at the the the the data and it

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,140
was about less than five percent of

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,780
people that come through the classes

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,320
actually used the one hour of of of

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,960
coaching Consulting so when uh for

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,240
example Rickard who's who's who's a

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,400
scrum master and when he comes back and

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,380
says can I get another error or can I

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,700
get another error or he phones me in the

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,740
evening to talk about the cool stuff

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,439
that he's been doing in in the office

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,939
and how it's impacted on his team and to

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,619
ask some questions and what do you think

41
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,680
might be better or

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,180
um you know even just he's he's he's

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,220
telling me about his awesome day right

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,780
that that

45
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,320
interaction for me is hugely valuable

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,720
because records the getting more value

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,759
providing more value to his company to

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,439
his organization because he's able to

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,259
you know maybe serve some extra

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,479
information or even just chat you know

51
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,099
sometimes sometimes you just need to

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,420
chat with somebody who might even not

53
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,959
know anything about what you're talking

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,660
about right but can provide you with a

55
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,580
sounding board and if it's somebody that

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,700
and that that's that that

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,819
um internship idea right or

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,800
um that that ability for those scrum

59
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,959
Masters to have somebody that they can

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,700
come and talk to to say well I tried

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,620
this and it didn't work out what am I

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,420
doing wrong and it might be well you're

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,099
not doing anything wrong right that

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,080
could be the biggest value that they get

65
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,000
from that conversation you're not doing

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
anything wrong that's just the way it

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
works here's something else you might

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,519
want to try

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,580
so I think that

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,220
um mentoring internship

71
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,060
um model I think is is really important

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,940
to people's learning and I expect that

73
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,860
off the iterative the the the the

74
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,540
immersive

75
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,840
um type of training that there'll be a

76
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,819
lot more of that uh type of experience

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,560
for people and people wanting more of

78
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,120
that experience so I'm actually really

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
looking forward to that because I love

80
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,560
uh having a chat and finding out how

81
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,659
people are actually using the things

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,060
that we're talking about

83
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,560
um and being successful at it because so

84
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,720
many times

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,459
um companies that call me in to help are

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
only calling me into help when things

87
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,659
aren't going so well for them

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,220
so I don't see a lot of the successes

89
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,959
right because with the time those

90
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,400
successes are generated I'm already off

91
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,080
to the doing the next thing or working

92
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,239
for the next company and they're

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,280
implementing the ideas but being able to

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,560
have those follow-on conversations where

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,480
somebody's actually implementing some of

96
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,900
those ideas trying stuff out it's just

97
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,400
just awesome
