1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,120
Simon synic talks about starting with

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,960
why it's a whole book on that topic and

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,199
the question is does it does it really

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:23,039
matter like who gives a crap and I think

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,800
I think the big piece here we need for

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,279
for us to understand it we need to bring

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,679
in bring in something else um start with

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,559
why is is is great but I think the

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:36,600
underlying reasons are a little bit a

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,960
little bit different and that's that um

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
what motivates

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,800
people so now we're we're we're talking

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
about if you want to look at up drive by

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,920
Dan

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,320
pink um and what Drive talks about is

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,520
what are the

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,000
underlying things that motivate people

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,879
um now we we all know the extrinsic the

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,840
outside motivators of people um you know

20
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,360
you want you want more money you want

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,960
that cool uh uh new PlayStation game um

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:16,200
so stuff money stuff uh a roof over your

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,799
head food right uh kids education uh

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,880
these are all things that are extrinsic

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,560
motivators they come in from the outside

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,079
and they're the most important thing if

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
they're a problem right if you're

28
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,159
worried about putting food on the table

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,240
then money is going to be your most

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,399
important thing if you're worried about

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,560
putting a roof over your kid's head or

32
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:37,040
your head uh then money is going to be

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,439
your most important thing and to get

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,680
that problem solved so that's my focus

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:48,960
but once people are earning enough that

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,000
those things are dealt with right

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,280
they're they're resolved we've resolved

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,439
all of those extrinsic or generally

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,640
resolved all of those extrinsic

40
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:03,920
motivators then more money is not

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,240
something uh that motivates motivates

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,119
people if it is right because in some

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,000
organizations they have that culture

44
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,560
where money's the motivator think of um

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,360
you know uh I'm thinking of stocks and

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,000
shares or sales or whatever they've

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,720
turned it into a game right they've

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,640
turned the being the best salesperson or

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,440
making the most money or beating the

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,080
quota it's not actually about the money

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,280
anymore it's about the points it's about

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,280
the game um but if you take all of those

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,959
things off the table and you don't have

54
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,080
that weird dysfunctional game culture

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,640
which probably works quite well in sales

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,800
right but is still dysfunctional game

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,840
culture then the underlying intrinsic

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,599
motivators the stuff that comes from the

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:59,280
inside of you is three things autonomy

60
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,959
Mastery and purpose right autonomy we

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,120
want to we want to feel like we're in

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,720
control of our destiny right we choose

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,799
how we do things we choose where we go

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,080
um um we choose who we work for right

65
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,720
all of those those types of things um

66
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,959
and then we've got

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,400
Mastery I I don't know anybody who gets

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,360
up every morning and thinks they want to

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,400
do a worse job today than they did

70
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,879
yesterday most people want to get better

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,360
at their job um they want to learn more

72
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,799
about the thing they're doing again

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,560
remember we've taken that purely

74
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,000
Financial motivation off the table by

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,159
we've got enough money uh uh to not

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,720
worry about those things so then our

77
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:48,799
motivation becomes a a a a a Mastery

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:53,200
right uh a way that that um money still

79
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:57,079
sits on the table is that um taoris uh

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,000
practice uh Taylor and Gant um um

81
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,680
Frederick winow Taylor and Henry Gant

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,280
came up with this this ideology around

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,159
paying people less than they need to

84
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,400
survive and then they have to work

85
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,680
really hard to get the bonus in order to

86
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,519
go above that survival line right that's

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,560
that's you're maintaining your

88
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,479
deliberately an organization is

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,800
deliberately and explicitly maintaining

90
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,800
people below that line in order to

91
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,160
artificially make money the motivating

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,440
factor um so that so that that's what

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,080
the focus is money money money money

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,919
money cuz maybe we've got lots of money

95
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,160
we're a bank right so we can throw money

96
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,199
at people and get more stuff all the

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,840
other stuff's hard autonomy Mastery and

98
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,600
purposes hard right money's easy so

99
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,160
let's make money the point by paying

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,080
them less right that's uh uh quite a

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,400
common strategy I I worked at a company

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:55,160
a while ago where um they paid about 10%

103
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,240
below industry standard for uh wages um

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,039
but there was a a 50% bonus scheme right

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,880
or was it 20% below so you you felt the

106
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,960
pinch on the base wages uh um like you

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,759
you could just make things meet but only

108
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,280
barely but then at the end of the year

109
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,560
you got that 50% 50% bonus if the

110
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,120
company did well um that might be called

111
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,400
golden handcuffs there all kind of kinds

112
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,479
of things around that so that's um but

113
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
if we take that off the table Mastery

114
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,680
doing the best job you possibly

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,639
can becomes more of a motivator than

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,440
money would you rather have people

117
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,240
looking for their next paycheck or being

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,800
motivated to be the best they can

119
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,960
possibly be at that job right so we've

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,039
got autonomy and Mastery and the last

121
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:46,840
one is purpose and that's where we jump

122
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:52,120
into this start with why right purpose

123
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:55,000
is do you understand how your work

124
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,600
contributes to some greater goal that

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,800
you care about right the greater goal is

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,800
also a a a book on this Topic start with

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,360
why why are we doing the thing we're

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:11,039
doing what am I then doing right now to

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,520
help visualize this this this why and

130
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,919
when when you start focusing on that why

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,080
right why we're doing the thing we're

132
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,319
doing what is it we're trying to achieve

133
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,880
the outcome of that is visions and goals

134
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,360
and when you when you move from

135
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,639
traditional project-based model towards

136
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,599
a product based model we start to remove

137
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,400
certain things from that process right

138
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:38,400
we start removing uh uh milestones and

139
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,000
deliverables um and those those things

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,639
that Gant charts those things that

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
enshrine that traditional project

142
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,199
management process but what the mistake

143
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,720
lots of organizations make is they don't

144
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,599
replace it with anything they have no

145
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,039
why they have no motivation they have no

146
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,479
goals they have no outcomes that the

147
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,520
team's trying to achieve so if you look

148
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,319
up team right for example if you look up

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
team in the dictionary it says group of

150
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,479
people working together towards a common

151
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
goal

152
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,240
so if you don't have any why if you

153
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,080
don't have any goal if you don't have

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,560
any outcome that the team is trying to

155
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,319
achieve or even the organization is

156
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,199
trying to

157
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,120
achieve how how how do we have teams how

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,280
could we possibly have teams how do they

159
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,840
what are they working together

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,080
towards right what are they

161
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,080
collaborating on towards so they have no

162
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,520
purpose right does this knock on effect

163
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,240
and we talk about this in the product

164
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,639
owner um the the the PSM P prodct owner

165
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,639
class um and we talk about uh uh

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,479
replacing the

167
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:44,560
um the these traditional elements with

168
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,039
vision value and validation right Vision

169
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,639
where are we going what are we trying to

170
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,479
achieve that that you'll get that from

171
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,919
your why right so the why is at the top

172
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
why are we doing what we do create a

173
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:57,520
vision that's how we're going to get to

174
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,520
this why if we enact this Vision we

175
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,199
should get to this this why we're here

176
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,680
and then what's the value we're trying

177
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,159
to achieve and that should inform your

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,560
goals right what's the next Big Goal

179
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,599
we're trying to achieve and perhaps

180
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,199
you've got a a set of goals or

181
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,639
hierarchies or okrs or smart or whatever

182
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,680
it is you're using to figure those out

183
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,080
but the way we know we've got the right

184
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,919
thing is that the people doing the work

185
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,599
can feel a connection from the work that

186
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,440
they're doing every day through those

187
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,280
however you're defining your your your

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,959
goals towards the vision and the why

189
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,039
we're here why are we a company why do

190
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,279
we exist and in fact if you do that you

191
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,519
engage your customers as well because

192
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,120
they see your purpose they see every

193
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,240
employee working towards that common

194
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:51,279
purpose and that common purpose

195
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,560
becomes that that that thing that makes

196
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,160
customers look at your organization wow

197
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
they're doing great things they're going

198
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,800
in this direction and that's

199
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,560
fundamentally what Apple has achieved

200
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,320
or did achieve uh many years ago um they

201
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:10,399

202
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,000
status that customers believed in their

203
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,800
Journey right they believed in their

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,839
journey and it wasn't because they had

205
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,120
some Vision that the customers liked

206
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,800
