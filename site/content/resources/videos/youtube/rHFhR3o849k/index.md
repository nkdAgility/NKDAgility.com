 There is a significant difference between a #projectmanager and a #scrummaster, and it's often hard for people to understand how a scrum master operates through influence, coaching, and mentoring rather than leveraging the authority and power of a traditional #projectmanager.

#agile is significantly different to #projectmanagement and so a whole different set of skills is required, but you still need to cover all the bases that a traditional #projectmanager would focus on via the #scrumteam.

So, what does great look like? What does a powerful, effective #scrummaster look and sound like? In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood articulates what makes a truly great scrummaster.
