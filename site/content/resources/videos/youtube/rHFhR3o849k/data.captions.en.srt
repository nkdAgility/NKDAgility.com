1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,780
so the question is what makes a truly

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,000
great scrum master

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,380
and I think that's a very very difficult

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,619
question to answer because

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,840
it's very

6
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,180
circumstantial right it depends on the

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,519
organization the team you could have

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,560
somebody who's a great scrum Master for

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,660
this team at this organization and

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,820
they're not so great at the next gig

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,500
they go to right because the the team is

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,719
different the organizational culture is

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,980
different the things they were the fits

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,780
not right

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,660
so I think one thing that makes a great

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,059
scrum Master is having a good fit with

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,600
the team which is why it's important

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,280
that the to be honest that the the team

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,079
selects the scrum Master rather than the

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,239
scrum Master being selected for them

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,059
which is why you normally see great

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,239
scrum Master as being promoted as the

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,159
wrong word but promoted within uh within

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,780
the team I.E the team selects this

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,240
person as somebody who can deal with our

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,340
stuff that we as a team trust to deal

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,799
with our stuff

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,299
um and

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,320
they need to really focus beyond the

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,979
team

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,619
because in general the biggest problems

32
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,680
that a team Focus are not problems of

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,200
the team's own making right there's

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,759
there's most

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,700
uh um teams of people doing work know

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,320
very well what they do well and what

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,060
they don't do well even if they don't

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
admit it to themselves they still know

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,040
right and so the scrum Master can focus

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,659
for a while on bringing bringing that to

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,420
the surface of bringing bringing that

42
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,340
out and helping them understand and what

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,520
it is they're doing what the impact is

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,759
and but at some point usually very

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,680
quickly right within the first year of a

46
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,200
team working together is you start

47
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,299
hitting those organizational impediments

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,300
those those things in the organization

49
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,340
that just make it hard to do what it is

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,200
we're all trying to do which is provide

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,180
value for the organization provide value

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
for the business provide value for the

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,280
customers

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,319
and those are all things that are

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,580
impediments to our Effectiveness and

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,900
some of those things the team can deal

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,480
with themselves

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,780
but other things take

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,720
significant

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,459
application of politic I guess I think

61
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,099
I'm using the right word but effectively

62
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,500
politics right but the the act of

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,180
politics which I think is politic where

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,040
where you're building relationships with

65
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,080
people in the organization

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,480
um as a scrum Master you might build

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,340
relationships with the head of HR you

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,319
might build relationships with the CEO

69
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,819
depending on where how big your

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,860
organization is and what it looks like

71
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,640
you're going to build relationships with

72
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,860
people so that they know your level of

73
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,780
competence your understanding of the

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,000
work that's underway your understanding

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,120
of the way the business operates and

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,819
that you're making suggestions to help

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,540
the organization be more effective and

78
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,200
then they respect your your opinion they

79
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,980
value at your Council and that you're

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,739
able to then affect change inside of the

81
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,159
organization not by doing it yourself

82
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,680
but by helping everybody understand else

83
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,840
understand and some of the things that

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,220
might need to change

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,940
um and that I think is the difference

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,739
between a a a just a scrum Master doing

87
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,900
a job and a great scrum Master is that

88
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,120
willingness to build those relationships

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,500
to to

90
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,500
further the organization
