So the question is what makes a truly great scrum master? 

I think that's a very, very difficult question to answer because it's very circumstantial, right? It depends on the organization, the team. You could have somebody who's a great scrum master for this team at this organization and they're not so great at the next gig they go to, right? Because the team is different, the organizational culture is different, the things they were, the fits not right. 

So I think one thing that makes a great scrum master is having a good fit with the team, which is why it's important that, to be honest, that the team selects the scrum master rather than the scrum master being selected for them. Which is why you normally see great scrum masters being promoted, as the wrong word, but promoted within the team, i.e. the team selects this person as somebody who can deal with our stuff, that we as a team trust to deal with our stuff. 

And they need to really focus beyond the team because, in general, the biggest problems that a team focuses on are not problems of the team's own making, right? Most teams of people doing work know very well what they do well and what they don't do well. Even if they don't admit it to themselves, they still know, right? And so the scrum master can focus for a while on bringing that to the surface, on bringing that out and helping them understand what it is they're doing, what the impact is. 

But at some point, usually very quickly, right within the first year of a team working together, you start hitting those organizational impediments, those things in the organization that just make it hard to do what it is we're all trying to do, which is provide value for the organization, provide value for the business, provide value for the customers. 

And those are all things that are impediments to our effectiveness. Some of those things the team can deal with themselves, but other things take significant application of politics, I guess. I think I'm using the right word, but effectively politics, right? But the act of politics, which I think is politic, where you're building relationships with people in the organization. 

As a scrum master, you might build relationships with the head of HR, you might build relationships with the CEO, depending on how big your organization is and what it looks like. You're going to build relationships with people so that they know your level of competence, your understanding of the work that's underway, your understanding of the way the business operates, and that you're making suggestions to help the organization be more effective. 

And then they respect your opinion, they value your counsel, and that you're able to then affect change inside of the organization, not by doing it yourself, but by helping everybody else understand some of the things that might need to change. 

And that, I think, is the difference between just a scrum master doing a job and a great scrum master, is that willingness to build those relationships to further the organization.
