1
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:12,059
that's a good question why is becoming a

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,320
scrum Master a great career option

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:21,359
I I feel like the

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,760
scrum Master is the first next step for

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,859
a team member

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,859
on Elite on the leadership

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,720
track right on the the like like the

8
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,180
gold shirts in Star Trek

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,440
right you're you're you're you're you're

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,140
wanting to move forward you're wanting

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,579
to take on more more

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,920
um accountabilities you want to

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,140
demonstrate to your organization

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,700
um that you can you can

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,899
um

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,379
lead right that you can bring a team

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,559
Along on a on a journey and I think for

18
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,480
for that you have to demonstrate that

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,340
leadership before you get the position

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,140
and

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,699
um if you're a team member you've been

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,020
working every TF team for a long time

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:10,260
perhaps you've had a focus on

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,000
um excellence in whatever it is that you

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,040
do right because your background might

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,680
not just be coding right it might be

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,280
testing it might be operations it might

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,659
be a documentation right whatever that

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,659
is

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,680
if you've had a focus on

31
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,600
um excellence in how can I help my team

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,119
be more effective

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,939
right just as an individual as an expert

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,200
on that team then I think it's logical

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,040
that people on the team are going to

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,479
look

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,520
to you

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,020
for some of those answers right if

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
you're the knowledgeable person about

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,360
about Automation and how can we get

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,920
better at doing this thing and make what

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,640
we're doing Slicker so we add more value

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,340
to the customer and then that's you

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,200
demonstrating that leadership ability

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,540
that hopefully every member of your team

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
has right but if you stand out perhaps

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
they'll be looking to you more and

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,320
you'll kind of naturally fall into that

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,300
scrum Master role for the team the the

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,819
accountability you're picking up that

51
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,720
accountability that's perhaps lying

52
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,819
around

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
and um

54
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,340
once you're once you're there and the

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,099
team respects you and respects your your

56
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,739
your your ability to to help them become

57
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,920
more effective then that will be seen

58
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,560
hopefully in the organization

59
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,239
um and for me that that leadership

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,239
leadership track from a team member

61
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,099
starts with scrum master and then into

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,019
wherever wherever those go in your

63
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,599
organization right every organization is

64
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:47,340
different for how that flow is

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,879
um but it's that step on the leadership

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,379
ladder
