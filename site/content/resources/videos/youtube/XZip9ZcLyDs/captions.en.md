That's a good question. Why is becoming a scrum Master a great career option? 

I feel like the scrum Master is the first next step for a team member on the leadership track. Right? Like the gold shirts in Star Trek. You're wanting to move forward, you're wanting to take on more accountabilities. You want to demonstrate to your organisation that you can lead, that you can bring a team along on a journey. 

I think for that you have to demonstrate that leadership before you get the position. If you're a team member, you've been working every TF team for a long time. Perhaps you've had a focus on excellence in whatever it is that you do, right? Because your background might not just be coding; it might be testing, it might be operations, it might be documentation, right? Whatever that is. 

If you've had a focus on excellence in how can I help my team be more effective, just as an individual, as an expert on that team, then I think it's logical that people on the team are going to look to you for some of those answers. If you're the knowledgeable person about automation and how can we get better at doing this thing and make what we're doing slicker so we add more value to the customer, then that's you demonstrating that leadership ability that hopefully every member of your team has. 

But if you stand out, perhaps they'll be looking to you more and you'll kind of naturally fall into that scrum Master role for the team. The accountability you're picking up, that accountability that's perhaps lying around. 

Once you're there and the team respects you and respects your ability to help them become more effective, then that will be seen hopefully in the organisation. For me, that leadership track from a team member starts with scrum master and then into wherever those go in your organisation. Every organisation is different for how that flow is, but it's that step on the leadership ladder.
