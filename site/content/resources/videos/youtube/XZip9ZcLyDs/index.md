**Why is becoming a Scrum Master a great career option?**

As an Agile Consultant, I think this is a great question, and I'm often asked why becoming a Scrum Master is a great career choice. 🚀  So, in this article, I will address this popular question circling the Agile sphere.

So why is becoming a Scrum Master a great career option? 🤔

## The Scrum Master - A Stellar Step on the Leadership Track

Here's my perspective: Firstly, I feel like the Scrum Master is the first next step for a team member on the leadership track.  🌟

The Scrum Master role is the perfect stepping stone for any team member on their journey to leadership. Imagine donning the gold shirt in Star Trek - it signifies your ambition to move forward, take on more significant accountabilities and demonstrate your leadership capability.   You want to demonstrate to your organization that you can lead.

### Demonstrating Leadership Before Position

But remember, you have to demonstrate that leadership before you get the position. 🎯

Leadership isn't granted with a title. It's earned through action. If you've been a long-time team member, irrespective of your speciality - coding, testing, operations, or documentation, your focus should be enhancing your team's effectiveness.  💼

### Striving for Excellence in Your Domain

As a professional, you've been thinking, "How can you help your team be more effective?" as an individual, as an expert on that team. Logically, team members will look to you for some of those answers.

Now, what does this mean?

Let's say you're a whiz at automation. You're demonstrating leadership if you're constantly striving to make processes slicker to deliver more value to customers.

You're showing that you're knowledgeable and capable, and in doing so, you're naturally transitioning into the Scrum Master role.  🌟And by adding more value, you are demonstrating that leadership ability. 🏆

### Picking Up Accountabilities

Once the team respects you, and respects your ability to help them become way better, then that will be seen hopefully in the organization.

As a Scrum Master, you pick up accountabilities that perhaps nobody else addresses. Once you're there and your team respects your ability to enhance their effectiveness, your leadership will go from strength to strength.  🎯

## Scrum Master - Your First Step on the Leadership Ladder

So, if you ask me, the Scrum Master role is the starting point on the leadership track for any team member. From there, your journey can take you wherever you wish to go within your organization.

Remember, every organization has a unique flow, but the Scrum Master is a universally recognized and respected step on the leadership ladder. 📈
