Imagine donning the gold shirt in Star Trek - it signifies your ambition to move forward, take on more significant accountabilities and demonstrate your leadership capability.&nbsp;&nbsp; You want to demonstrate to your organization that you can lead.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-demonstrating-leadership-before-position\">Demonstrating Leadership Before Position</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But remember, you have to demonstrate that leadership before you get the position. 🎯</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Leadership isn't granted with a title.
