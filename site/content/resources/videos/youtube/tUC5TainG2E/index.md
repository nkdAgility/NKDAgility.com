Many of you have asked,  "How did I become the third Scrum training provider for Microsoft?"

One thing is for sure: I can say it's been a journey deeply rooted in building relationships and continually developing expertise.

Let's dive deep into that journey. 

## Rooted in Relationships

First and foremost, I owe much of this to my success as a Scrum training expert to my long-standing relationships with Microsoft, which have been instrumental to my development.

As a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) in the DevOps space for 14 years, I've established a rapport and delved deeply into Microsoft's unique ecosystem, giving me unique insight.   🤝

This relationship has allowed me to engage deeply with Microsoft's culture.  Their unique acronyms and idioms, like "let's double click on that", are all ingrained in my professional vocabulary now.

## Dual Domains Expertise  

While many know Microsoft, few are seen as experts in _DevOps and Scrum/Agile and I feel fortunate to be seen as an expert in_ DevOps and Scrum.

This unique combination meant numerous clients using Azure DevOps or other Microsoft tools found their way to me and made me stand out as a Scrum trainer in this dual domain.  🛠️

The result?

My conversations with these clients invariably shift from tools to Agile methodologies, enhancing their knowledge and practice.

## Power of Referrals

I believe referrals of any sort our indeed the best compliment I could receive.  🌟

Due to this synergy, when Microsoft's clients had questions or needed guidance, they were often pointed my way.  "Go speak to Martin" became a standard directive.

Such endorsements, over time, cemented my position as a go-to expert in this niche.  This chain of trust and credibility is not built overnight but is the outcome of years of delivering value.

## Building Relationships, One Client at a Time

Building long-standing relationships is at the core of what I do.  While some clients come for just one training session, others, like the Department of Work and Pensions in the UK, have been recurring customers for nearly a decade.   

Such client relationships are beyond once-off contracts.

This longevity speaks volumes about the value I bring to each session, even if its impact isn't always immediately evident.  So, the consistent value I bring to the table keeps them coming back.

## Visibility and Value

My engagements aren't limited to training sessions.  🚀

Just last week, I had the privilege to engage at the MVP Summit in Seattle, mingling with product teams and offering feedback.  🌟

Engagements like this, including speaking at internal conferences or providing key insights at larger events, have expanded my network and enriched the depth of my relationships within the industry.

## In Conclusion

It's not just about expertise; it's about connection, mutual understanding, and the consistent value one delivers.

This journey to becoming Microsoft's preferred Scrum training provider has been nothing short of incredible, but at its heart, it's all about relationships and unyielding dedication.

So, the next time someone asks, "How did you...?" My answer will always be – through relationships and relentless dedication.
