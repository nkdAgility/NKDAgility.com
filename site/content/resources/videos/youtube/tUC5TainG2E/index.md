# How did you come to be a preferred scrum training supplier for Microsoft?

#microsoft are internationally recognized and acknowledged to be a powerful, market-leading force in #productdevelopment and #software engineering. They are also one of the few mega-organizations to master #agile as their preferred choice for complex problem-solving and complex solution development.

So, if these people and their various departments are world leaders in #agile and #scrum, who trains them? Who do #microsoft turn to when they want to progress to the next level of #agile #productdevelopment?

Martin Hinshelwood.

In this short video, Martin talks about the enormous privilege of leading #scrumtraining at Microsoft, alongside his #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting roles, and how that came to be.
