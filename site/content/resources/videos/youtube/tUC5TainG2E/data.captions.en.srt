1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,080
how did I become

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,599
the third scrum training provider for

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,280
Microsoft I think

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,320
um there's a couple of things in there

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,240
the first one is I I have a

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
long-standing relationships with with

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,960
Microsoft

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,720
um I've been a Microsoft MVP most

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,480
valuable professional in the devops

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,019
space for 14 years

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,700
um so that also leads on to the second

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,820
reason right because people at Microsoft

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,280
know me but also I know I know I know

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,540
Microsoft I know the organization I know

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,180
how

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,100
um they're in acronyms right they're

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,160
very keen like most organizations

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,039
they're very keen on their own acronyms

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,079
um if you've popular phrases like let's

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,239
take that offline

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,879
um and let's double click on that where

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,620
where all the times I first heard of

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,660
those were through Microsoft so just

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,640
engaging with their product teams their

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,100
people on a regular basis has has always

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,020
been something I've done

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,760
um and

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,479
I'm seen as an expert in both species

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,479
right it's actually quite unusual I feel

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,920
to have somebody who's both an expert in

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,520
devops

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,060
and an expert in in scrum and the agile

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,759
space and that that combination means

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,700
that an awful lot of my customers are

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,320
Microsoft's customers right because

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,939
they're using as your devops they're

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,740
using Microsoft tools and they hear

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,240
about me through that and then we start

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,560
talking about agile and we have those

40
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,799
conversations

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,380
so when Microsoft asks its customers who

42
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,259
do you who do you go speak to they might

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,600
say me and when their customers ask have

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,159
been asking Microsoft for years how do I

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,439
do this how do I do that well maybe you

46
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,180
need to go speak to Martin right

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,820
um so I get a lot of referrals from

48
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,960
Microsoft I get a lot of uh

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,200
um

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,240
engagement that way so it just I guess

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,700
it maybe seemed like a natural step to

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,060
have that conversation so when Microsoft

53
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,099
reached out to scrum.org and said we we

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,860
want to speak to some trainers

55
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,860
um I was at the the on that list to go

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,140
speak to them and in in that meeting

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,200
just being able to to have those

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,300
conversations right to talk about what

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,459
it is they're trying to do and know

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,319
where they're coming from and that

61
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,700
that's part of that relationship that I

62
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,379
already had with Microsoft already

63
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,060
understanding how they work and how they

64
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,860
do things

65
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,260
um and that's something that that I try

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,640
and build with every customer sometimes

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,620
it's difficult because you don't work

68
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,060
with everybody for very long right so

69
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,920
building relationships is sometimes

70
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,080
difficult when all they want is a single

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,660
training class but I have other

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,000
customers that I work with constantly

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,260
and they keep coming back

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
um I've been working with the Department

75
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,620
of work and pensions in the UK for whoo

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,480
seven eight years nine years maybe and

77
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,000
they keep coming back for more classes

78
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,379
and they keep having to it what's more

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,540
interesting in that engagement is they

80
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:11,519
have to really struggle to get me to do

81
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,340
the to do the engagements for them so

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,840
they really want me to do it right

83
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,940
um because of their procurement rules

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,620
and how do you get the person that you

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,720
actually want to do it to do it and

86
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,360
that's that's that's hard

87
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,580
um and I think that attests to the value

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,560
that they are getting from the classes

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,720
that I'm teaching and some of those

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,340
values might not be immediate or

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,200
immediately apparent it's not like

92
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,540
people learn a new skill and suddenly

93
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,940
they're magically able to do it but it's

94
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,819
in that that long-term systematic

95
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,640
engagement with a single customer and

96
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:45,959
keep coming back off I'm speaking at

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,680
their

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,500
um

99
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,360
they're having a conference this week

100
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
um an internal organizational conference

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,400
and I'm doing two talks for them at

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,959
their internal organizational conference

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,599
um I speak at Microsoft conferences I

104
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,099
was just last week at the MVP Summit in

105
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,080
Seattle talking to people on the product

106
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,760
team engaging with them giving them

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,580
feedback on the product

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,920
becoming more known right you you build

109
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,459
those relationships and that's really

110
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,959
