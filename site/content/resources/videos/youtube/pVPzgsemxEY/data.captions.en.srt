2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,480
them not quite right for their meaning

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,080
uh but one of the the key phrases that

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,240
we use all the time in kamban is kaizan

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,199

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,640
continuous Improvement it's keeping

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,720
changing things hopefully for the better

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,560
because you're observing improvements in

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,119

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,160
