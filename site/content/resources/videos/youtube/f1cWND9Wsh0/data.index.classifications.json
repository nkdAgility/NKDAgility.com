    "reasoning": "The content critiques the use of Lego in Scrum training, emphasizing professional context and perceived seriousness, but does not explicitly reference first principles or foundational Scrum constraints. It focuses on professionalism, messaging, audience appropriateness, and effective training toolsâ€”important topics, but not discussions of immutable, irreducible first principles. No references to first principle theorists, boundaries, or system constraints are present. Most discussion is about methods and context-fit, not core, non-negotiable truths. Therefore, direct mentions and conceptual alignment scores are low: the contentâ€™s main thrust lies in applied pedagogy, not foundational principles. Depth of discussion is slightly above superficial as it explores multiple facets of the Lego debate, but it lacks any analysis or naming of first principles. Audience fit and signal are higher since the writing targets Scrum professionals and focuses mostly on topic.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While thoughtfully assessing training methods in Scrum, the article doesn't discuss first principles or their application. Its focus is more on appropriate pedagogy and professional tone than on foundational, immutable Scrum truths. Thus, it only weakly fits the 'First Principal' category.",

    "reasoning": "The content critiques the use of Lego in Scrum training but never mentions Service Level Expectation (SLE) or its calculation, application, or purpose. It is focused on pedagogical credibility, audience engagement, and mismatches between learning tools and executive training, not on delivery forecasting, flow metrics, or continuous improvement through SLE. No key terms or authoritative sources related to SLE are cited. The only LinkedAgile concept is Scrum itself, tangential to SLE, and thereâ€™s no reference to measurement, prediction, or expectation of delivery times. The critical tone toward training practices aligns poorly with the intent of SLE content. Therefore, while itâ€™s tangentially aimed at a practitioner audience, it is almost entirely off-topic for this classification.",
