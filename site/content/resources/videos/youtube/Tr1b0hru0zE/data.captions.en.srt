1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,960
want to make your legacy systems faster

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,879
more scalable and easier to change You

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,639
need

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,880
DevOps A lot of organizations struggle

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,559
with modernizing their systems They know

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,480
they need to move faster but they're

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
stuck with decades of decisions

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,720
Decisions that made sense at the time

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,880
but are now holding them back And the

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
risk of change just feels

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,480
overwhelming This is where DevOps

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
practices come in By introducing

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,039
automation continuous integration and

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,520
deployment and systemwide observability

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,160
you make it easier safer and faster to

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,960
evolve your systems you reduce the cost

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,280
of change shorten feedback loops and

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,399
create an environment where improvements

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,200
happen continuously not just once every

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,360
few years in a major

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,920
rewrite At Naked Agility we don't fix

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
your systems for you We help you

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,960
understand how to make your systems work

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,359
better for you That means looking at the

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,760
entire flow of work identifying where

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,520
things slow down and making it possible

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,560
for teams to deliver improvements

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,320
without disrupting business

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,240
operations Modernizing a legacy system

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
isn't about throwing it all away and

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
starting over It's about making smarter

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,320
decisions at the system level So change

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,280
becomes a natural part of how you work

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,920
If you want to make legacy modernization

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
a reality let's have a conversation
