OKRs are never explicitly mentioned, described, or implied in the theoretical sense aligned with John Doerr's principles and book 'Measure What Matters.'

Audience alignment is partially compatible as organizational leaders responsible for strategic decisions in legacy modernization contexts may overlap in audience interests with OKRs. While DevOps modernization can intersect theoretically with OKRs (both aiming at agility, transparency, and outcome measurement), this particular content does not bridge explicitly or implicitly to the OKR theoretical or practical foundations. Hence, conceptual alignment, depth, and intent scores are low, and no penalties were applied as nothing outdated or contradictory to OKR concepts was detected.",

Audience overlap is possible only because DevOps practitioners may sometimes participate in cross-functional teams, but there is no explicit or implicit targeting of Product Developers as a conceptual entity.
