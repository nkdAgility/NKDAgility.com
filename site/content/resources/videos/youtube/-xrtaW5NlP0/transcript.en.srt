1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,120
I think kanban is

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,120
hugely popular in all Industries not

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,039
just creative Industries because it does

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,260
model the behavior of the existing

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
system right it doesn't require you to

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,939
change uh how you're currently doing

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,460
things so effectively when you're

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,920
implementing a kanban approach you you

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,740
start from where you are you model your

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,320
existing system right and in modeling

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,380
your existing system you actually iron

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,079
out some variability because if you've

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,020
got 10 people in your organization that

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,719
are let's say uh let's say our output is

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,719
marketing videos right uh marketing

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,480
content for uh for businesses that we're

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,079
working with then and we've got 10

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,000
people working on that marketing content

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,460
How does each person choose what the

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,460
next thing it is they go work on if

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,180
every person picks differently right

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,920
makes choices differently then we've got

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,159
a high degree of variability in our

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,780
system that we can iron out right if if

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,960
all these 10 people just got together

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,760
and agreed whatever thing is in in our

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,460
list of things to do that's been sitting

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,220
there the longest let's do that

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,979
right that that way the oldest thing is

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,060
the quickest thing uh uh to get through

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,460
the system because you're trying to

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,580
reduce your overall cycle time right for

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,759
your customers then you can use

34
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,860
kanban to model your system right you

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,900
have that conversation what is our

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,100
working agreement what is our definition

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,900
of workflow for our system you model it

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,340
decide when it starts when it finishes

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,840
and then you've got the data to figure

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,000
out

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,979
when we make changes

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,320
is it improving the system or is it not

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,140
improving the system actually I I had

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,360
this conversation uh a couple of months

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,700
ago with my dentist

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,280
right so totally nothing to do with

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,500
software nothing to do with it nothing

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,780
to do with any of those Industries if

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,300
you're if you're a dentist right you

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,959
have to book people in for appointments

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,700
how quickly can you book people in for

52
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,020
appointments so if I say to my dentist I

53
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
need an appointment and it's three

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,340
months out

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,280
right that's that's that's that's a very

56
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,860
long time right so their their cycle

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,300
time their ability to get something into

58
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,099
the system I've asked for an appointment

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,560
and be able to actually deliver it is

60
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,020
really really long really long what

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,180
could they do to shorten that cycle time

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,860
well perhaps they need little gaps in

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,220
their CIS in their in their in their

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,200
calendar to be able to have things that

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,480
pop in perhaps they need to deal with

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,640
cancellations better perhaps they can

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,019
chase people to say do you still need

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,840
this appointment all those kind of

69
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,519
things right but how do they know that

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,920
that's effective how do they know that

71
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,239
it's valuable and it's changing uh the

72
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,860
way they do business

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,480
right because wouldn't it be great if

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,040
you went to the dentist and said I need

75
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,260
an appointment and they said yeah we've

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
got one next Thursday for you right that

77
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,500
would be great

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,260
um so having

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,000
a model for your system so you can

80
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,280
monitor the flow of work through your

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,260
system and look at your cycle times look

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,959
at your throughout look at how long

83
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,900
things are taking because

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,480
the shorter uh the throughput quite

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,980
often shorter the cycle time right

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,659
people getting into the system and

87
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,099
getting through it quicker and I'll tell

88
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,900
you something people are happier

89
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:36,239
customers if they get their stuff faster

90
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,340
and that's what we're looking at we're

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,220
looking at that Continuous Flow

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,500
continuous delivery of stuff whatever

93
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,060
stuff's in your system we want to

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,560
deliver it as quickly as possible
