    "reasoning": "The content centers on the evolving role and practical skills of the product owner within agile contexts, with an emphasis on ownership and collaborative learning. However, it only tangentially connects to 'Customer Focus': it discusses product owners' organizational responsibilities, immersive learning, and cross-functional influence, but offers minimal explicit reference to defining, measuring, or prioritizing according to customer value or outcomes. There is little direct mention or substantive exploration of customer feedback, metrics, or customer-centric evidence-based decision-making. The majority of the narrative frames product owner development as an inward, role-based journey rather than focusing on delivering measurable customer value in line with agile or DevOps philosophies. Some audience overlap exists, but dedicated customer focus is not the main intent or depth.",
