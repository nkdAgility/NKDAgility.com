Therefore, the score for direct mentions is 0.0, and both conceptual alignment (0.3) and depth (0.2) are close to zero, as the content neither discusses nor approaches the SLE concept. The intent is only slightly above zero (0.5) since there is a very remote, tangential relevance to Agile-based improvement, but no targeted alignment with SLE as a practice or tool. The audience is Agile practitioners (5.3), which aligns with the expected SLE audience, so a moderate score is given in that dimension. Signal to noise is relatively high (7.4), as the content is focused and relevant for its stated topic, but that focus is not on SLE.
