1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,139
so the question is why is the PSP all a

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,179
great fit

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,320
um for the eight week immersive learning

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,980
experience and I think it's a great fit

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,840
because they're even more than

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,760
I think even more than all of the other

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,420
classes there's a huge disconnect

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,899
between how we teach and explain the

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,520
breadth of what the product owner is and

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,399
does

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,800
and people are actually trying to do it

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,379
in their organizations

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,879
um we're we're talking about the product

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,680
owner as a an agile product manager

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,600
right so it's still product management

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
all the tools and techniques of product

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,579
management but then we're bringing in

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,579
this idea of the product owner moving

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,640
from a scribe right that's the the the

20
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,040
the lowest form of product owner through

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,520
a journey towards

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,600
um mini CEO or entrepreneur of that that

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,640
product

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,400
like they're they're the top of that

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,280
product totem they totally own the

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,680
product full fiscal and uh commercial

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,560
accountability for this this product

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,040
within within your their organization

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,020
and then they're able to uh focus on

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,460
other things that maybe they didn't have

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,799
access to at a different level so things

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,479
like how do you bring in marketing how

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,460
do you bring in sales how do you bring

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,259
in contracts right if you've got to

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,640
write contracts with customers the

36
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,960
product owner needs to be involved in

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,820
that because how you write the contract

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,579
matters to how you actually deliver the

39
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,560
work and they're in control effectively

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,060
delivering the work or deciding what

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,619
order we're going to do things in right

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,060
so

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,520
that that immersive class allows us to

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,619
create better connections but between

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,979
those activities that we're going to

46
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,840
talk about in the class and the the the

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,940
the the stuff that they need to do in

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,739
their organization and perhaps how they

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,080
have conversations about how they do do

50
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,940
that stuff right how do they if they

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,400
can't directly

52
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,840
um control that thing which is quite

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,640
often the case right if you're in a

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,800
bigger organization the chances of you

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,739
controlling branding and marketing it's

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
probably pretty low right but

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,959
perhaps you could influence it maybe you

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,020
can be part of those conversations that

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,200
then your voice becomes respected at

60
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,360
that table as well so that

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,239
they're going to be more involving you

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,099
looking at you would you think as well

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
because you've had some great Insight on

64
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,599
that topic and you need to be credible

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,819
in all of those spaces you need to be

66
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,319
credible in in that conversation about

67
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,780
legal and the conversation about

68
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,540
marketing contracts all of those things

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,040
so that you can have that engagement and

70
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,560
this

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,340
iterative and incremental immersive

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,980
experience is going to help you bring

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,900
empiricism into that story right you we

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,159
can we can talk about stuff we can talk

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,860
about stuff till we're blue in the face

76
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,680
but you can go actually try that thing

77
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,260
in your organization and then come back

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,480
and say well that didn't work

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,340
right then we can have a conversation as

80
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,659
a group which is great because you'll

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,640
have a bunch of product owners there

82
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,260
right who've all tried the same thing

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,180
right they've all gone off and tried the

84
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,739
same activity in their organization or

85
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,720
different parts of the same organization

86
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,400
and they can come back with help and

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,739
advice they can provide the help and

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,680
advice I tried it my organization is

89
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,599
also a bank right or the same bank and

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,440
we were able to do this because we had

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,480
this conversation with our compliance

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,099
director and they were able to say yes

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,080
we can do it that way that's different

94
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,239
from the way we were doing it before

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,519
oh awesome I'll go have that

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,440
conversation with my compliance person

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,019
and see if we can't come to the same

98
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,040
conclusion right that that sharing and

99
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,260
collaborating of ideas is is going to be

100
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,000
exponentially increased as part of the

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,040
immersive learning experience for the

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,019
the product owner
