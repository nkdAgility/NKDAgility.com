1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,980
so a product by product backlog

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,800

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,300
backlog is just a list of things that we

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,240
would like the product to do that it

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,880
doesn't do yet that's it uh it can be

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,080
super short here's one thing that I

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,939
would like the product to do that it

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,820
doesn't do yet that's a product backlog

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,840
uh here's 20 things that I'd like the

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,480
product to do that might be a product

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,720
backlog uh here's something that's not a

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,099
product backlog here's 5 000 things I'd

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,739
like the product to do that is

14
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,960
absolutely not a product backlog that's

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,399
just a Dumping Ground that's a dump

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,640
right

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,160
um one of the key things that makes a

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,739
product backlog a product backlog is

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,120
that everybody stakeholders product

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,980
owner and team members understand

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,960
everything that's in there and if they

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,960
