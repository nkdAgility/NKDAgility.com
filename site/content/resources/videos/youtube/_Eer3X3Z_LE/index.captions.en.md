So a product backlog is really very misunderstood. A product backlog is just a list of things that we would like the product to do that it doesn't do yet. That's it. It can be super short. Here's one thing that I would like the product to do that it doesn't do yet; that's a product backlog. 

Here's 20 things that I'd like the product to do; that might be a product backlog. Here's something that's not a product backlog: here's 5,000 things I'd like the product to do. That is absolutely not a product backlog; that's just a dumping ground. That's a dump, right?

One of the key things that makes a product backlog a product backlog is that everybody—stakeholders, product owner, and team members—understand everything that's in there. And if they don't, it's not a product backlog.
