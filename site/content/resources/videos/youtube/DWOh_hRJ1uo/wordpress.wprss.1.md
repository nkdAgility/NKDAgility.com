As the world shifts from traditional #projectmanagement to #agile #productdevelopment, it has created a great deal more opportunities for people who want to become a #scrummaster rather than a #projectmanager.

But, what do you do if you don't come from a #softwareengineer or #developer background? How do you work with teams if you have no idea how to build #software or solve #complex engineering problems?

A great place to start is to recognize that your current field of expertise, combined with the experience you have working within a team in that environment, is a valuable place to start.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the best way to launch your career as a #scrummaster and how to integrate your current knowledge, skills, and experience into becoming a valuable #scrummaster for your industry.
