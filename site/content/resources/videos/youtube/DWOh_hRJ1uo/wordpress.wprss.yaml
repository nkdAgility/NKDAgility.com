  - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWOh_hRJ1uo\r\n\r\nAs the world shifts from traditional #projectmanagement to #agile #productdevelopment, it has created a great deal more opportunities for people who want to become a #scrummaster rather than a #projectmanager.\r\n\r\nBut, what do you do if you don't come from a #softwareengineer or #developer background? How do you work with teams if you have no idea how to build #software or solve #complex engineering problems?\r\n\r\nA great place to start is to recognize that your current field of expertise, combined with the experience you have working within a team in that environment, is a valuable place to start.\r\n\r\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the best way to launch your career as a #scrummaster and how to integrate your current knowledge, skills, and experience into becoming a valuable #scrummaster for your industry.\r\n\r\nAbout NKD Agility\r\n\r\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \r\n\r\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/training/ \r\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nakedalmweb.wpenginepowered.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \r\n\r\nWe would love to work with you. \r\n\r\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg"
