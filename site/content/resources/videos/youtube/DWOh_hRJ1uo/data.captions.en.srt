1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,519
foreign so the question is what's my

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,700
advice for becoming a scrum Master

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,199
outside of software engineering

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,660
I don't I think that's a that's an

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,320
interesting topic because

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,680
in order to be a scrum Master be a

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,279
successful effective scrum master I

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,460
believe that you need to be able to

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,920
um understand fully the work that the

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,760
team is doing so it makes the most sense

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,840
for a scrum Master to be somebody who

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,059
has been part of a team doing the thing

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,480
that they're going to scrum master has

14
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,320
been in that domain has been part of

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,020
those those organizations and has worked

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,020
their way to that advanced position

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,500
which is the scrum master

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,180
um as a change leader in the in as part

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:10,260
of a team right so if you want to be a

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,680
scrum master and you're not currently in

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,799
the ite software world then what

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,220
probably makes the most sense is to be

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,259
part of a team doing what you like and

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,580
enjoy doing anyway

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,740
right I was speaking to somebody

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,960
recently who has an accounting

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,119
background and wants to be a scrum

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,600
Master to accounting teams to help

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,020
accounting organizations get better at

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,220
doing accounting right and that's really

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,040
what what you want to be and being an

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,900
experienced team member doesn't mean

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,939
that you're awesome at the thing the

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,860
team does right you don't actually have

35
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,960
to be awesome at coding to be a scrum

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,540
Master for a coding team

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,180
but you have to understand

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,399
the coding you have to understand the

39
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,020
ramifications of devops you have to

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,500
understand the ramifications of

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,780
automated build automated testing of uh

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,660
what it means to be a software engineer

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,239
or means to be a tester right in that

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,980
space so if you want to be a scrum

45
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,560
master and your background is accounting

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,540
what better place to start than joining

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,900
an accounting team in an accountancy

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,920
firm and then working slowly to help

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,920
improve the way they work and at some

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,440
point that team that you work with

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,060
is going to be seen to be more

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,099
successful than other teams in the

53
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,900
organization and somebody's going to

54
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,480
come along and ask why why is this team

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,060
more accessible successful why is it

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,340
doing better why are are people on this

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,200
team happier than the other teams that

58
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,300
we have in our organization and they're

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,860
going to come and ask and your boss is

60
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,620
going to say well I don't know but if

61
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,920
you go speak to Bob right he's he's been

62
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,420
leading that those ideas and maybe maybe

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,640
Bob can tell you a little bit more about

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,500
how that works and then you build a name

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,540
for yourself you're given more

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,760
accountability and responsibility within

67
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,620
the organization and you can do it at a

68
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,140
higher and higher level across across

69
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,480
the arc for me that's that's that's

70
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,640
leadership right that's the leader who

71
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,640
serves from the scrum kite
