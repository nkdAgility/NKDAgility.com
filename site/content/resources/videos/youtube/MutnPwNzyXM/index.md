As an agile consultant, I've learned a multitude of lessons over the years, but one stands out above the rest: the statement of work (SoW) often bears little resemblance to the actual problems my clients face. This insight transcends the realm of agile consulting; it applies to any consulting role. 

### The Disconnect Between SoW and Client Needs

In my experience, the primary focus for many consultants is to deliver on the SoW. It’s a straightforward approach: "Here’s the contract, and this is what we need to do." However, I’ve found that this can lead to a losing proposition. Delivering exactly what’s outlined in the SoW can result in unhappy clients because, more often than not, it doesn’t address their real needs. 

- **Unmet Needs**: Clients may receive what they asked for, but if it doesn’t bring about systemic, lasting change, they’re left feeling dissatisfied. 
- **Temporary Solutions**: Without addressing the core issues, organisations often revert to their old ways as soon as the consultant leaves.

### A Personal Anecdote

Let me share a personal experience that illustrates this point. I was on a train in England, and the Wi-Fi was utterly horrendous. Frustrated, I tweeted the train company to express my dissatisfaction. Their response? "We’re not contractually obligated to provide Wi-Fi." 

This response epitomises the pitfalls of rigidly adhering to a contract. It’s a classic case of missing the forest for the trees. The company was so focused on the letter of the contract that they neglected the spirit of customer service. 

### Rethinking Contracts

This experience has shaped my approach to contracts. I often prefer to work without formal contracts, opting instead for a more flexible arrangement. Here’s how I typically operate:

- **Variable Contracts**: I use what I call an "email contract." It’s simple: "Can you help us out?" "Yes, I can." "What dates?" "These dates." That’s enough for me to book my flights and get to work.
- **Trust Over Formality**: This approach has served me well, especially with larger clients who often come with their own contracts. I assume an NDA for every engagement, but I prefer to maintain a level of flexibility that allows me to adapt to the client’s needs on the ground.

### Delivering Value Beyond the SoW

The key takeaway here is that delivering value should be the primary goal, not merely fulfilling the terms of a contract. I strive to provide enough value that my clients feel confident in saying, "Yes, Martin delivered." 

- **Focus on Relationships**: Building a relationship with clients allows for a more dynamic and adaptive approach. When you understand their needs, you can deliver solutions that truly matter.
- **Value-Driven Engagement**: By prioritising value over contractual obligations, I ensure that my clients receive the support they need, even if it diverges from the original SoW.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the most valuable lesson I’ve learned as a consultant is to focus on the real needs of my clients rather than the constraints of a contract. By fostering relationships and delivering genuine value, I can help organisations achieve lasting change.
