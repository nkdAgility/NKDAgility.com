1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,000
well I think so the question is what is

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,240
the most valuable lesson

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
you'll you've learned as an agile

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,119
consultant and and I think you could

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
take the word agile out and it's just

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,660
the most valuable lesson I've learned as

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,240
a consultant in whatever flavor right

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,220
I've ended up working in and that's that

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,960
quite often the statement of work in

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,199
fact almost always the statement of work

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,180
Bears no relevance to the problems that

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
the customer actually has

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,360
and that's where

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,379
you have to try and tread carefully

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,200
because it is is your business is my

16
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,480
business as a consultant in delivering a

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,940
statement at work or is it maximizing

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
the value that I bring to the customer

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,199
right

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,820
and quite often Consultants will deliver

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
to the stem to work right here's the

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,820
contract this is what we've been told we

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,860
have to do and we need to deliver to

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,500
that contract

25
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,500
um I find that that's a losing

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,020
proposition because you can quite often

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,460
and this happens a lot have unhappy

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,260
customers

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,439
because you've delivered what they asked

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,659
for but it's not what they need right it

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,100
doesn't actually bring any systemic

32
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,960
lasting change to their to their

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,340
organization and things go back to the

34
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,080
way they were as soon as you leave

35
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,159
because there's not that that change

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,040
because the statement of work didn't

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,200
include it or a scope for it

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,799
um a great example of that was

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,619
um

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,579
I was on a train uh

41
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,340
um

42
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,380
in in England somewhere and it had Wi-Fi

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,020
on the train and the Wi-Fi was

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,040
absolutely horrendous absolutely

45
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,119
horrendous

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,579
and I I think I tweeted at the the train

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,860
company and that's using my mobile

48
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,140
signal when I could and basically said

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,899
your Wi-Fi is completely unusable on the

50
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,880
train completely unusable and the answer

51
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,020
I got back obviously from their

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,799
marketing team right because that's

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,079
where Twitter goes uh was well we're not

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,220
contractually obligated to provide Wi-Fi

55
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,560
so

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,720
of yours right that was pretty much the

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,180
the answer that came back from them it's

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,180
like it's not in the contract so if it

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,280
doesn't work we don't care right and

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,220
that to me

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,440
is is is that idea taking to a little

62
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,680
bit too extreme right of just following

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,879
what's in the contract I I quite often

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,819
don't like having contracts at all with

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,920
with with customers because because of

66
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,560
that I want to be able to dynamically

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,540
and adaptively figure out what it is

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,760
they need when we get on the ground and

69
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,940
get engaging and for most customers I

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,099
work with I just have a a a variable

71
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,720
contract an email contract right can you

72
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,640
come and help us out yes I can come and

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,739
help you out what dates can you come

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,040
these dates okay I'm there right and

75
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,319
that's enough for me to go go book

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,260
flights right pre-covered book flights

77
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,599
uh turn up on site and and help them out

78
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,120
and then invoice them afterwards and I

79
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,099
never never had a problem never been

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
burned I'm sure now I've said that it

81
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,959
will probably happen right but

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,700
um never had a problem uh for the big

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,560
large customers right they come with

84
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,540
their own contracts that they like you

85
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,180
to sign and then do EAS and all of those

86
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,519
things I just assume NDA right for for

87
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,260
every customer I work with

88
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,840
um but but

89
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,000
those bigger organizations of bigger

90
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,580
contracts lock you in to delivering

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,920
something that the procurement we need

92
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,480
right in the organization is going to

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,860
hold you to regardless of whether you're

94
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,319
delivering value to the customer so you

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,819
have to deliver enough value that the

96
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,739
people that you're working with will

97
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,900
happily just tick that box and say Yes

98
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,180
Martin delivered right what what what

99
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,739
what's in this statement of work when

100
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,060
actually there's no relationship between

101
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,040
what's in the statement of work and what

102
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,319
was delivered but we delivered what they

103
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,180
needed at the level they needed that

104
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,819
provided them with the value they needed

105
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,299
to not worry about what was written in

106
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,299
the contract

107
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,299
