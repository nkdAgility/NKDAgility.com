## It's All About Direction

Greetings, fellow agile enthusiasts!

Today, I've been asked, "What is a product vision?" 🤔

So, let's dive right into it, shall we?

In my view, a product vision boils down to one essential element - 'direction.'

Understanding the Concept of a Product Vision?

Now, that might seem a little vague, so allow me to elaborate.

To my mind, a product vision is our understanding of the destination we're striving for.  It's the 'North Star' that guides all the developmental efforts of our team. 🌠

It reflects the desired outcome that we're trying to achieve and the ultimate outcome we're trying to achieve at the end of a specific product cycle. 🔄

## A Look Ahead

A product vision must look beyond any immediate goals and into the future.  It's critical to understand that a product vision goes far beyond a product goal and I can say with conviction that it's definitely leagues beyond a sprint goal. 🔝

It's like gazing into the expectations of the product, envisaging what success would look like at the end of our journey.

Think of it this way.  A product vision is our best guess about the future state of our product, crafted in the present, steering us towards success.  It's the roadmap we sketch today to reach our goals tomorrow.

A product vision needs to resemble the end result if everything goes according to plan and we hit the bullseye.  🎯

In summary, I believe that a product vision is a long-term, overarching goal that aligns your team's efforts and keeps everyone moving in the same direction. 🚀

It paints a picture of the desired end state that will inspire your team, stakeholders, and customers.

To put it in simpler terms, a product vision is your beacon, guiding you through the development process.  It's not about the nitty-gritty details of every sprint or even the specifics of the product goal.  It's about the big picture, the direction you steer your product.
