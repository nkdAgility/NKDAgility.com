1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,519
question is what is a product division

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,940
and I feel like a product vision

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,599
is really just Direction

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,720
it's what's what's our currently

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,279
understood end states that we're trying

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,020
to achieve

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,600
what's the outcome that we're trying to

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,300
achieve at the end of this product cycle

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,980
so we're looking pretty far ahead we're

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,199
probably looking much further than a

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,140
product goal definitely much further

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,820
than a Sprint goal and we want to see

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,000
what

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,540
would it look like at the end if we were

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,540
successful
