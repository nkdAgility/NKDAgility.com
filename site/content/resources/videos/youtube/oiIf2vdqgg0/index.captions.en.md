Question is, what is a product division? I feel like a product vision is really just direction. It's what's our currently understood end states that we're trying to achieve. What's the outcome that we're trying to achieve at the end of this product cycle? So we're looking pretty far ahead. We're probably looking much further than a product goal, definitely much further than a Sprint goal, and we want to see what would it look like at the end if we were successful.
