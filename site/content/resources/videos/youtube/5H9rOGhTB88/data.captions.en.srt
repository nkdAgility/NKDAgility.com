1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:08,440
another key question to ask leadership

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,639
about their way of working is if their

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:15,000
teams are empowered to change their

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,600
processes based on what they

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,760
learn this is this is one of those

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,920
critical things that in order for a

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,960
group of people to work as effectively

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,199
as possible that doesn't mean they work

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,240
like another team working on the same

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,600
product or another team working on on a

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,040
different product it means that every

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,559
team although we're going to perhaps

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:42,840
follow some general guidelines about how

14
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,480
we want to uh do business with our

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,559
customer um perhaps that represents the

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,280
Cadence of delivery to our customer we

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,879
need teams to be empowered to change

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,399
their process based on what they learn

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,719
because just because you've decided that

20
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,160
something um needs to be a certain way

21
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,040
does doesn't mean that that adds value

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,759
to this team it might actually be waste

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,560
for team a while it is value for Team B

24
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,280
and we need to recognize that we want to

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,320
maximize the amount of value that teams

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,960
are able to create which means we need

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,560
to minimize any uh uh waste a great

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,119
great example of that is I used to work

29
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,920
with um work for an organization I was

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,799
Employee of Merl Lynch back in the day

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,799
and because they had had a a trading

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,600
desk software within the body of their

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,880
organization there were certain

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,680
processes that had to be in place for

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
all software in the

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,759
organization even if it had nothing to

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,000
do with this trading desk bit so the

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,040
trading desk defined those processes and

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,520
everybody had to follow them so I I was

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:00,119
building a small CRM system uh for a

41
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,479
group of about 20

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,280
um sales folks who were making calls uh

43
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,960
uh calling people up selling the

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,759
mortgages and what they wanted was a way

45
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,160
to uh you know tapy interface pop the

46
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,680
call I'm running it on my my desktop or

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,640
my laptop and I'm able to click see the

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,239
phone numbers call them up see notes

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:27,200
that kind that just a simple uh uh CRM

50
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,440
system and in order to deliver that I

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,200
had a whole bunch of constraints that I

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,000
had to work within one was that um I had

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,080
to have the architecture signed off

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,159
before I started and any changes to the

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,080
architecture need to be signed off as

56
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,760
well so if you think about as you're

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,200
building the product you can't go oh

58
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,000
actually that architecture I thought I

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,120
was going to use is wrong I need to do

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,519
something different it all has to go

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
through an architectural Change review

62
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,599
board right Central Central environment

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,360
and it was very time consuming so they

64
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,800
didn't get back to you within a few days

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,959
uh they got back to you within a few

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,519
weeks or a few months because they maybe

67
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,640
only sat once over a over a period or

68
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
they had a backlog of work right so

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,080
that's that's one thing for a small

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,799
system that doesn't have a lot of

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,280
consequence or any consequence for the

72
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,920
rest of the business and only affects a

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,319
small number of people that's a little

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,080
bit of Overkill right um I also had to

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,440
have all of the systems that I used even

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,280
though they weren't publicly facing uh

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
pent tested so we had to pay an external

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
company about

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,000
$20,000 per pentest to pentest our

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,959
system even though it was internal and

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,519
the data was of no consequence it's not

82
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,840
the trading desk system it's a

83
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:52,239
small data set for a small group of

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,920
people yes it has some PPI um but from a

85
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,959
risk value Factor we probably could have

86
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,920
done a lot less security Overture and

87
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,159
still provide Ed on the the the

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,720
compliance for the PPI external PPI

89
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,720
compliance site so that was a bunch of

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,879
waste uh that we couldn't change um and

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,199
what was the other there's two more we

92
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,040
had

93
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,440
um uh when I when I had to deploy to an

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,000
environment uh I had to have three

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,199
servers front end middle tier back end

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,639
so the database uh running on one server

97
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,440
um I had to to have a separate server

98
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:37,199
for um the the the middle tier the the

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,039
API so it had to have apis uh that were

100
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,800
available and then the front end had to

101
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,240
run on a separate machine and so you had

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,080
to have those three servers part of that

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,080
mix so you had to pay for them so it was

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,800
actually worked out about $33,000 per

105
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,520
month for those three um and then you

106
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,800
had to have a Dev environment a test

107
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,639
environment a uat environment and a

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,400
production

109
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,919
environment so that was $3,000 per

110
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,360
environment and I had to have four

111
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,639
environments for a little system that

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,720
was just used by 20 people in a call

113
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:16,120
center total Overkill total waste for

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,759
what it was we're created those were

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
processes that were imposed on us from

116
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,639
the rest of the business even worse we

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,800
were doing continuous delivery and in

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,120
the organization if you didn't uh submit

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,440
a change request for a deployment of

120
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,560
your product

121
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,160
uh more than I think it was 6 weeks in

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,680
advance it was considered an emergency

123
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,800
and you got a black mark against your

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
name and we were doing daily continuous

125
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,680
deliveries on a number of different

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,479
products uh that we were creating so we

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,120
got a lot of black marks in fact we got

128
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,600
the most black marks of any Department I

129
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,880
think the combined black marks of every

130
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,960
other department in the whole

131
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,840
organization because we were doing

132
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,600
continuous delivery because we were

133
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,199
starting to use modern engineering

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
practices we were punished

135
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,000
within the organization because that's

136
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,080
not the way we do things here so are

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,960
your teams empowered to change their

138
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,199
processes based on what they learn so

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,120
they can make everybody's lives better

140
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,000
and maximize the value that you deliver

141
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,039
to your

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,800
customers if your answer to any one of

143
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,319
these questions or the answer of your

144
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,160
business to any one of these questions

145
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,280
is no we're not doing that then you

146
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,759
would probably I probably wouldn't

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,039
consider that you're already in the

148
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,440
agile space right you're not already

149
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,000
agile you might be working towards it

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,080
and you might have put in loads of

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,319
effort but unless you can Mark every

152
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,919
single one of these six questions as yes

153
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,160
we do this this is how things work here

154
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,319
then we're still lacking we're still

155
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,599
trying we're still working towards

156
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,000
being agile now this is just a litmus

157
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:11,080
test dreamed up uh by uh the US

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,479
Department of Defense but they are

159
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,440
probably the least likely place for you

160
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:19,199
to expect something um with this High a

161
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,520
bar to have come from and I'm not going

162
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,879
to um go into a team uh and work with a

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,440
team or a company and if they're not

164
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,400
doing these things then I'm going to say

165
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,199
well you guys suck you're not agile

166
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,720
because you're not doing this that's

167
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:39,000
that's not how we work towards success

168
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:41,400
uh but I think it's hugely valuable from

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,280
the perspective of

170
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,879
self-reflection for you all to think

171
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,080
about the processes and practices in

172
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,360
your organization and are you a how many

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,400
of these six questions are you able to

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,800
achieve and what could you do to make it

175
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,759
a little bit easier for the teams for

176
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:09,720
the people doing the work to work work

177
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:09,720
towards this idea of not being agile BS
