This is fundamentally why having high quality, usable, working product on a regular cadence is a superpower for your teams and for your organisation in your ability to deliver value. 

So the concept that we talk about a lot from the perspective of modern software engineering that enables you to push quality, build quality, build security, build these things in from the beginning, build it in rather than testing it in later, is the concept of shift left. 

Shift left is about moving quality assurance earlier in the development cycle.
