Um, that's a good good question I don't know if you like the answer so the question is how did I know I was ready to transition from a devops practitioner to a devops consultant and I feel like I didn't it just happened to me that's for for me personally I feel like it just happened to me.

I worked predominantly in the Microsoft space I was awarded a Microsoft MVP in 2008 I think 2008 and that kind of gets you access to a different group of people and I got noticed by people who were consultants people who worked in consulting firms and then I was hired into a consulting firm so I feel like I don't know if it's the right answer but I feel like you don't make that decision somebody else makes it for you.

You need to be you need to be noticed right you need to you need to be good at what you do and you need to do something in that space that somebody who's in the consulting space notices you and says oh that would be great if you were able to leverage those skills to help people rather than just working in one job for one company right because I think it takes a little bit of a different mindset to help many at many companies than just just your own company.

But I have also met some of the best two of the best devops consultants that I worked with were actually hired from straight from university into a devops consultancy but they were hired out of a competition right so the devops consultant say I worked for in Seattle went to the local university and ran a competition with all of the students in computer science and then they picked the two that looked like they would make the most effective devops consultants.

And both of them are now I.T directors in multinational companies in the US so I think I think that that level of expertise demonstrate your expertise and you'll get noticed write blog posts right demonstrate that you know stuff build things in the devops space and people will see you hopefully and think you're doing good stuff and then want you to come and help them out some more and that's that's kind of how you know you're ready is people want your advice people want to talk to you people want to know you.
