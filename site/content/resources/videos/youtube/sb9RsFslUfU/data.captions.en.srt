1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,540
um

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,920
that's a good good question I don't know

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,019
if you like the answer so the question

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,599
is how did I know

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,080
I was ready to transition from a devops

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,500
practitioner to a devops consultant

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,500
and I feel like I

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,660
didn't it just happened to me that's

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,939
that's for for me personally I feel like

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,380
it just happened to me

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,260
um I worked predominantly in the

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:40,860
Microsoft space I was awarded a

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:43,379
Microsoft MVP in 2008 I think 2008 and

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,000
that kind of gets you access to a

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,579
different group of people and I got

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,160
noticed by people who were Consultants

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:54,660
people who worked in consulting firms

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,440
and then I was hired into a a consulting

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,059
firm so I I feel like

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,920
I don't know if it's the right answer

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,840
but I feel like you don't make that

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,659
decision somebody else makes it for you

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,000
you need to be you need to be noticed

24
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,500
right you need to you need to be good at

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,260
what you do

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,439
and you need to do something in that

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,260
space that somebody who's in the

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,720
Consulting space notices you and says oh

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,140
that would be great if you were able to

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,759
leverage those skills to help people

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,799
rather than just working in one job for

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,060
one company right because I think it

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,500
takes a little bit of a different

34
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,360
mindset to help many at many companies

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,880
than just just your own company

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,740
but I have also met

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,500
um some of the best two of the best

38
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,420
devops Consultants that I worked with

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,360
were actually hired from straight from

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,820
University into a devops consultancy

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,860
but they were hired out of a competition

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,200
right so the devops consultant say I

43
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,780
worked for in Seattle uh went to the

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,820
local University and ran a competition

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,340
with all of the students in computer

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,500
science and then they picked the two the

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,540
the the that looked like they would make

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,619
the the most effective devops

49
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,940
Consultants

50
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:15,900
and both of them are now I.T directors

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,660
in multinational companies in in the US

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,520
so I think I think that that level of

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:25,739
expertise demonstrate your expertise

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,160
and you'll get noticed write blog posts

55
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,620
right demonstrate uh uh that you that

56
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,680
you know stuff build build things in the

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,660
devops space and people will will see

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,400
you hopefully

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,840
um and think you're doing good stuff and

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
then want you to come and come and help

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,140
them out some more and that's that's

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
kind of how you know you're ready is

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,360
people want your advice people want to

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,400
