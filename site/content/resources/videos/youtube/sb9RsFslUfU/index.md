## From Practitioner to Consultant

When asked how I knew I was poised for the leap from DevOps practitioner to consultant, my initial instinct and honest answer was that I didn't have a definitive 'Aha!' moment.

It's complicated, yet, in retrospect, there were signals and undercurrents.

The landmarks on this expedition weren't neon signs but subtle nudges.

Let's talk more about these nuances. 🚀

## The MVP Milestone

It all began in 2008 when I received an unexpected recognition - the Microsoft MVP award.  Now, this wasn't just a laurel; it was a gateway.

This wasn't just another accolade.  It became my ingress to a world I hadn't explored before.

Unexpectedly, I found myself amidst a new tribe - a league of individuals in the consulting arena who took note of my expertise.  🌟

Suddenly, I was rubbing shoulders with consultants and individuals with a unique vantage point that shifted my career trajectory.

## The Power of Being Noticed

Here's a quirky revelation: I believe, at times, the decision to transition isn't purely yours.

I've garnered insight over time: sometimes, the universe chooses for you.   👀

You pave the path, but the discernment might come from external quarters and the power of being noticed cannot be underestimated. 

✨ You excel in your domain.

✨ You garner attention for your craft.

✨ Consulting moguls notice your potential.

And just like that, from working for a singular company, you are handed the mandate to be the beacon for many.

The objective transforms from delivering value in one organization to guiding several on their journey.  Such a transition isn't just about proficiency.  It demands a shift in perspective.

## Nurturing Talent: From Novices to Stalwarts

In my journey, I've also witnessed another breed of DevOps consultants.  Some of the most competent ones I've known didn't scale the conventional ladder.

I've known individuals who didn't tread the beaten path.

For example, people fresh out of university were scouted and hand-picked by consultancies, not for experience, but potential. 🌱

Their prowess was evident in competitions, in the raw vigour they brought to the table.  Fast forward, these are the people who, today, spearhead IT in some of the world's leading companies.

Tips for Aspiring Agile Consultant Stars

With all my years of experience in the Agile world, I want to share with you a blueprint for carving your path.  ⭐

Here's the blueprint:

\- Showcase Your Expertise: Make Your Presence Felt.  Venture into the DevOps landscape, create, build, innovate, leave your mark and demonstrate your skills.

\- Share Your Insights: Voice Your Thought Process, be it through blog posts or discussions, and let the world glimpse your knowledge reservoir.

\- Engage and Enlighten: When people start seeking your counsel and lean into your insights, that's a telling sign.  It signals you're not just proficient; you're influential.

And as I always believe, it's not about _readiness_.  It's about being seen, being of value, and having a unique narrative to share.

Together, let's dive into the intricacies of Agile and Scrum with my courses and set your trajectory towards excellence.
