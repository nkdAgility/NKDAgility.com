# How did you know you were ready to transition from DevOps practitioner to DevOps consultant?

Over millennia, the path to mastery has always involved empowering others to achieve the same outcomes or results you have achieved, through the effective transfer of knowledge, skills, and capabilities.

From architecture to sculptures, from chefs to software engineers, it has always been this way. As you master a certain element of something, it is in teaching, coaching, and mentoring others to achieve those same positive outcomes that we master our field.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about his path to mastery and how he made the transition from practitioner to consultant.
