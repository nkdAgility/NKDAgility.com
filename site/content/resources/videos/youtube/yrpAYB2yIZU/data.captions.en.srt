1
00:00:03,549 --> 00:00:11,509
so I just came upon a nasty situation in

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,780
which my primary domain controller in

3
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:17,780
fact my only domain controller of my

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,400
demo lab environment and has popped off

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,910
this message box and I have been unable

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,460
to resolve it I've tried to activate

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:30,050
Windows it failed and I've tried to do a

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,630
bunch of other things so what I need to

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,510
do is create our new domain controller

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,910
and migrate everything across if I can

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,160
so hopefully this is going to work so

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:46,660
this server

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:50,359
let me pop this open this is air LAN

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:56,059
which is my primary domain controller if

15
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:57,920
I flip over to my new server which is

16
00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:07,100
COBOL it's not currently joined to the

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:09,799
domain so I I do not have DHCP I will

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,820
need to set a hard-coded IP address for

19
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,450
this machine so we're going to and now

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:23,930
let me check which ones which network

21
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:27,439
connect it'd be nice if it let me know

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:31,880
which one was which so let's just get

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:39,950
the status and this has an IP address so

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:45,130
this is Wi-Fi and this does not there we

25
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:45,130
go so this is private

26
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,860
I have fed two networks one plugged into

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,860
the internet and the other plugged into

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:08,380
just the servers so let me just fix it

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:17,440
IP address with one and currently I need

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:21,220
to set the DNS of the server that is our

31
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:30,090
domain controller so let me join the

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:30,090
domain and here we go

33
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:42,190
go join this machine to the domain they

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:44,110
don't have to reboot this machine I have

35
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,610
activated so I won't be in the same boat

36
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:54,280
as I was before and there we go welcome

37
00:02:48,610 --> 00:03:04,440
to the and naked isle I'm com domain so

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:04,440
let's restart this machine for a minute

39
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:37,680
as my domain administrator and more or

40
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,270
less there we go we are now in and the

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,300
domain so what we really want to do is

42
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:48,540
we want to promote this machine to be a

43
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:51,150
domain controller within the domain so

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,290
now if we go to local server we've got

45
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,760
our server COBOL in the naked LM domain

46
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,330
so now I need to promote this to be a

47
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:06,020
domain controller so the first thing we

48
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:13,080
do is when to add roles and features and

49
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:15,420
the server and I got to go to so we need

50
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,620
to select item Directory domain services

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,180
and DNS server and we're going to be

52
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,100
decommissioning the old server moving

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,900
all the services across to this server

54
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,580
and so we need to make sure we have all

55
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,190
of the things available we'll need our

56
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:34,740
DNS server we need to select any

57
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,200
additional features it's already set up

58
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:44,820
anything that we need when we selected

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:46,560
the options that we want it so it's

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,320
going to automatically set all this up

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:57,300
and there we go we can start the

62
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,790
installation going and there we go

63
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,130
installation has completed we still have

64
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:03,930
at some configuration to do because

65
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,310
although we've installed all the PCs we

66
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,830
need we haven't configured any of them

67
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,050
yet so I'm going to click on this option

68
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,740
to promote at the server to a domain

69
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:17,280
controller so we're going to M we're not

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,900
creating a new domain or a new forest or

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,340
any of those things I already have all

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,690
of that set up I just want to move

73
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,180
everything across so I'm going to add

74
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,430
this domain controller to the existing

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,700
domain so it's pre-selected the domain

76
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:34,030
and that I was currently on she's

77
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:37,540
awesome so I'm just going to click Next

78
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:40,560
and really we mostly want a default set

79
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,820
of options so right now is communicating

80
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,480
with the mid mean domain controller and

81
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,090
figuring out what options I can select

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,040
so now that that's loaded you can see

83
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,160
that the it's limited the options that

84
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,740
we have available and we've got dinner

85
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,550
server enabled global catalog we don't

86
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:08,110
want it read-only

87
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:18,250
I'm going to leave the default site put

88
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:20,590
in our password options replicate from

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,090
well I can see I need to mean controller

90
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,350
or it can pick the one other one I have

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,110
easy enough

92
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,260
I'm going to leave the path default this

93
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:32,260
really is a demo system but I've made a

94
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,000
lot of configurations so I don't want to

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,770
lose the existing to me and that's why

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,030
I'm not just setting up a new one it's

97
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,860
fun when you have to then go and rebuild

98
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:44,320
all of your servers that have sequel

99
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:46,060
server and whatnot on them there we go

100
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,000
there's completed all the appearance it

101
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,480
checked there's a couple of triangles a

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,850
couple of bangs default security

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,540
settings are enabled I'm okay with that

104
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,420
a thorat of parent zone can be found

105
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,710
again I'm ok with that

106
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:06,040
and so we can just go ahead and click

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,480
install if you were in a production to

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,840
mean you may want to look more carefully

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,840
at those things I'm not so I don't care

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,600
so because we just installed domain

111
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,580
controller it's going to restart as

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,170
automatically if I click close

113
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,650
I think it's effectively just going to

114
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:31,630
there we go

115
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:35,190
often do it itself now this restart me

116
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,190
take a little bit longer than normal

117
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:52,160
there we go

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:54,590
let me Logan is the administrator no no

119
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,960
we're almost there we have a server it

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,480
is a domain controller if we still have

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,900
a bunch of things that we need to move

122
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,460
across to this it's going to sink in the

123
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,800
background at some of the capabilities

124
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:18,820
and it should other DNS may not be

125
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:18,820
replicating yet go to DNS manager

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,910
and it has already replicated awesome so

127
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,430
you can see all the the servers that

128
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,349
I've had in the past so I'm no longer

129
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,580
exist probably needs a bit of cleanup um

130
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,440
but it's already replicated the DNS

131
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:44,020
across but there are a number of other M

132
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,940
pcs - Active Directory that are specific

133
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,710
to a server and we need to move those

134
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,900
across before we can decommission the

135
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,510
old server so the first thing we need to

136
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:56,380
do is open up our Active Directory users

137
00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:00,840
and computers and if we right click on

138
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:04,000
our domain and click operations masters

139
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,150
we will see that I am currently the our

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,100
ID operational master is airline and

141
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,380
we'd like it to be cool bald so if we

142
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,770
hit the Change button that will change

143
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:19,690
it over our primary domain controller is

144
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:24,910
currently airline we change that now

145
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:27,460
it's COBOL our infrastructure master is

146
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,550
currently airline again change it over

147
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,680
and I were at COBOL for all three of our

148
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,000
operational master roles now in a very

149
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,340
large domain you might have these on

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,340
separate servers for performance and

151
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:48,430
scalability but here we don't really

152
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:52,450
need that now everything should be

153
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,190
transferred over m to cobol we're going

154
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,590
to leave that for a couple of minutes

155
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,020
just make sure that everything trans

156
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,210
over errors over correctly and then

157
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,600
we'll be able to decommission the old

158
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:09,480
domain controller so in order to remove

159
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,900
Active Directory we remove idividuals

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,900
pick our server

161
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,800
so you can see that we still have the

162
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,410
schema operational master role on this

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:31,620
server so if we right-click and select

164
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:37,380
run and run MMC for /a and add the

165
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:41,410
schema snap in there we go we're now

166
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,350
currently we connect to airline there we

167
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,769
go so we're connected to our operational

168
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:49,390
master and if we click operations master

169
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:53,140
you can see that it says airline in both

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:57,300
boxes what we need to do is change the

171
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:02,019
server and see then know both online

172
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,630
connect to cobol and if we right-click

173
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:07,269
select operations master we don't have

174
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:10,390
current as airline we want to change it

175
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:12,880
to cobol so we hit change yes we want to

176
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,190
change operational master has now been

177
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,070
changed

178
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:22,300
close that no so we've removed the

179
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,880
schema operational master we also need

180
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,329
to remove the domain name operational

181
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,750
master in order to that we run the

182
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:34,740
domains and trusts we right-click on

183
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:38,260
Active Directory domains and trusts

184
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,240
select operational master and you'll see

185
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,279
that the current is airline we want it

186
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:49,740
to be cool ball and we can just change

187
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:52,890
that over and we've moved that across as

188
00:11:49,740 --> 00:12:03,570
we've moved these over we're pretty good

189
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:07,750
we can proceed with the removal hit next

190
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,300
and that was it will and we can demote

191
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,310
it

192
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:17,079
we won't we've successfully it demoted

193
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:22,709
it's going to restart anyway just force

194
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,709
it there we go

195
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,800
now while this machine is still is not a

196
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,140
domain controller anymore it's still

197
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,880
currently joint the domain I believe we

198
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:49,960
will check that in just a minute message

199
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:51,630
we're trying to avoid nope it's a

200
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,510
workgroup awesome

201
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,160
so this server has been and removed from

202
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,940
the domain and we have a new domain

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:04,720
controller and really as there is

204
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:10,230
absolutely no going back at this point

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,230
anyway let me shut down this server

206
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:23,250
there we go it's off I'm going to open

207
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:26,230
up my hyper-v manager and I can delete

208
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:32,250
there we go I've deleted that server

209
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:32,250
so now cobalt is our domain controller

210
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:45,820
so on Kobol and if we do I pee don't

211
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:52,530
fake and this is for so now I can change

212
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:55,530
let me pick our machine let's connect to

213
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,530
Baltar

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:09,210
take the right password you may need to

215
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:17,770
login as a local administrator let me

216
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:22,860
open up Sarah manager up not on Wi-Fi

217
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:27,940
well let's open up our private about six

218
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:30,190
before and this is number four is our

219
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:42,150
new DNS server our new active joyed your

220
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:42,150
domain let's try something simple

221
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:02,380
and we're able to find everything in our

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,950
domain and I will be who is not on this

223
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,740
machine and add them in so we were able

224
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:11,770
to query connect to itit rectory so it

225
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:15,010
looks like everything's doing just fine

226
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,470
and there you go that's how to migrate

227
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:22,170
Active Directory from one machine to

228
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,170
another and dmort the old machine
