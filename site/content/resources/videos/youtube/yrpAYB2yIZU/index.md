I recently found myself in a rather tricky situation with my demo lab environment. My primary domain controller, which also happened to be my only domain controller, threw up a message box that left me scratching my head. After several failed attempts to activate Windows and troubleshoot the issue, I realised I needed to create a new domain controller and migrate everything across. This experience was a reminder of the importance of having a robust setup and a solid plan for such scenarios.

### Setting Up the New Domain Controller

First things first, I had to get my new server, COBOL, ready to join the domain. Since it wasn’t currently connected, I needed to assign it a hard-coded IP address. Here’s how I approached it:

- **Identify Network Connections**: I checked the status of my network connections to determine which one was which. I had two networks: one connected to the internet and the other solely for the servers.
- **Configure IP Address**: I set a static IP address for COBOL and pointed its DNS to the existing domain controller, AIRLAN.

Once that was sorted, I joined COBOL to the domain without needing a reboot, which was a relief. I was now ready to promote this server to be a domain controller.

### Promoting the Server

The next step was to promote COBOL to a domain controller. Here’s a quick rundown of the process:

1. **Add Roles and Features**: I navigated to the server manager and selected the Active Directory Domain Services and DNS Server roles. This was crucial as I planned to decommission the old server and migrate all services to COBOL.
   
2. **Installation**: After selecting the necessary features, I initiated the installation. Once completed, I proceeded to promote the server.

3. **Configuration**: I opted to add COBOL to the existing domain rather than creating a new one. The wizard guided me through the necessary configurations, including enabling the DNS server and global catalog.

4. **Final Steps**: After confirming the settings, I clicked install. The server restarted automatically, and I logged in as the administrator.

### Migrating Active Directory Roles

With COBOL now functioning as a domain controller, it was time to transfer the Active Directory roles from AIRLAN. Here’s how I did it:

- **Access Active Directory Users and Computers**: I right-clicked on the domain and accessed the operations masters to see which server was currently holding the roles.
- **Role Transfer**: I changed the roles over to COBOL for all three operational master roles. This step is vital in ensuring that the new server takes over all responsibilities.

### Decommissioning the Old Domain Controller

Once I confirmed that all roles had successfully transferred, I was ready to decommission AIRLAN:

1. **Remove Active Directory**: I initiated the process to remove Active Directory from AIRLAN. This involved running the necessary commands and confirming the removal.
   
2. **Final Checks**: After demoting AIRLAN, I ensured it was no longer a domain controller and that it had transitioned to a workgroup.

3. **Clean Up**: Finally, I shut down AIRLAN and deleted it from my Hyper-V manager, leaving COBOL as the sole domain controller.

### Conclusion

Migrating Active Directory from one machine to another can seem daunting, but with a clear plan and methodical execution, it can be done smoothly. This experience reinforced the importance of having a backup plan and being prepared for unexpected issues. 

If you find yourself in a similar situation, remember to take it step by step, ensure all roles are transferred correctly, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help if needed. After all, the world of IT is all about collaboration and learning from one another. Happy migrating!
