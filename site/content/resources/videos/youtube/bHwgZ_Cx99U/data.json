If you’ve seen a company scale up—more teams, more developers, more features—only to watch everything slow down, you’re not alone.  \n\n🔸 Dependencies pile up\n🔸 Teams get out of sync  \n🔸 Technical debt explodes\n\nThe issue isn’t the number of teams. It’s how they work together.  \n\nWhen teams aren’t aligned, they spend more time coordinating than delivering. Handoffs, rework, and endless meetings replace shipping value.  \n\nAt Naked Agility, we take a different approach.  \nScaling isn’t about adding more teams—it’s about removing friction.  \n\n✔️ Eliminate dependencies \n✔️ Preserve high quality  \n✔️ Speed up delivery with the right patterns & guardrails  \n\nBecause scaling should mean better outcomes, not just bigger teams.  \n\nIf your organization is struggling with this, let’s talk.
