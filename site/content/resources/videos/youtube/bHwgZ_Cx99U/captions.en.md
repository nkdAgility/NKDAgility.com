More teams doesn't always mean faster delivery. You've probably seen this happen: a company says, "Let's scale up! More teams, more developers, more features, faster releases!" And then everything slows down. Dependencies pile up, teams get out of sync, and technical debt explodes. 

So what's wrong? The issue isn't the number of teams; it's how they're working together. When teams aren't aligned, they spend more time coordinating than delivering. You see constraints, handoffs, rework, and instead of shipping value, they're drowning in knittings and delays. 

At Naked Agility, we take a different approach. Scaling isn't about adding teams; it's about eliminating friction. We help organisations structure their teams in a way that removes dependencies, keeps high quality, and actually speeds things up. The right patterns, the right guard rails, and just enough structure to keep things moving without bogging teams down. 

Because at the end of the day, scaling should mean better outcomes, not just bigger teams. If your organisation is struggling with this, then let's talk. We can help you scale without the chaos.
