All discussion about delivery speed or coordination is generic and high-level, not specific to SLE or the techniques used to forecast or manage work delivery against probabilistic timeframes. The audience may overlap somewhat, as some Agile practitioners interested in SLE might read this, but the purpose, details, and main message are unrelated. The signal-to-noise is low for SLE, as 100% of the content is devoted to scaling teams and removing coordination friction, not anything related to forecasted delivery times with probabilistic ranges. Therefore, each scoring dimension is extremely low-to-zero, resulting in an appropriately minuscule confidence score.",
