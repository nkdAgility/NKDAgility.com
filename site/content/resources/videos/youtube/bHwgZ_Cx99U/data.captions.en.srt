1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,240
more teams doesn't always mean faster

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,720
delivery you've probably seen this

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,160
happen a company says let's scale up

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,160
more teams more developers more features

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,960
faster releases and then everything

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,160
slows down dependencies pile up teams

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,119
get out of sync and Technical debt

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,199
explodes so what's wrong the issue isn't

9
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,880
the number of teams it's how they're

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,080
working together when teams aren't

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,640
aligned they spend more time

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,399
coordinating than delivering you see

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,320
constraints handoffs rework and instead

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,559
of shipping value they're drowning in

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,160
knittings and delays at naked agility we

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,480
take a different approach scaling isn't

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,199
about adding teams it's about

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,199
eliminating friction we help

19
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,199
organizations structure their teams in a

20
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:55,199
way that removes dependencies keeps high

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,239
quality and actually speeds things up

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,640
the right patterns the right guard rails

23
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,519
and just enough structure to keep things

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,839
moving thing without bogging teams down

25
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,439
because at the end of the day scaling

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,400
should mean better outcomes not just

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,320
bigger teams if your organization is

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,680
struggling with this then let's talk we

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,680
can help you scale without the chaos
