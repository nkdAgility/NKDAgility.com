# Why are recessions a great time for organizations to evaluate the opportunity of agile?

Traditional organizations tend to focus on #projectmanagement because it is well-known, comfortable, and for many people, just the way things work around here.

A well-funded organization that has strong market leadership in a stable environment could afford with traditional #projectmanagement for a fairly long time, but at some point, they will experience disruption that forces them to reevaluate what they do, how they do it, and why they are doing it.

Deep recessions and intensely competitive markets can force organizations to think about agility, responsiveness, and the ability to quickly adapt over the comfort of well-known processes and frameworks.

Why is that? Why is #agile such a great opportunity to explore when things become tough, volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why #agile has proven so popular in times of deep disruption, recession, and turbulence.
