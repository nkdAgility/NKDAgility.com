The question is why why might recessions be a great time to re-evaluate our opportunities with agile and I think it's deeper than that forget the agile story right I think the time when you should be investing the most in marketing from a sales perspective right when you should be investing the most in your people from getting the most out of the out of the people that you have is is when the world's a troubled place around your organization when you're when you're struggling and life is difficult that's when you should invest more time in the people and the um and and and getting people to understand the markets and add more value to your customers right so so that really brings you back around to that agile conversation right we talk about agile but what is agile really it's about responding to the market more quickly more quickly that's not English responding to the market quicker right um so we want to respond to the market quicker and in order to respond to the market quicker we need people with the skills and capability to be able to respond to the market more quickly I did it again with uh um with the the the accountability and to be able to do that right that they are able they feel like they are empowered and to be able to go and go and make the changes necessary because that was that was the thing from from years and years ago um when a lot of the organizational practices were created it it was designed to slow the change in the organization because the markets were slow right you wanted to be able to take advantage of your market for as as long a period as possible because it's going to exist for a long time so you didn't want to change the company let's create some burratic bureaucratic processes to enshrine the way we do things uh push responsibility up the organization rather than down and the people at the top made the decision so the people at the bottom who are closest to the market have to have to realize it has to be painful enough because they don't actually care about your business right it has to be painful enough that something's wrong in order for them to tell their boss that that something's wrong and then painful enough to go all the way up the chain to the top and then eventually a decision is made to do something different and comes all the way back down own um but the time that response comes back down the market hasn't shifted in the old way but today the market that opportunity's gone right we we don't have that opportunity to take it or we've lost a bunch of money in the delay it takes to make that decision so so I think um so I can't think of a better time to invest in the ability capability of your organization to deliver value to your customers the more value you deliver to your customers the more favorable your customers will look because they're getting a higher return on investment therefore if there is a choice in our highly competitive markets then they're going to pick you over the competitors that's that's how you survive a recession and they don't because you're able to more quickly adapt to the market demand and provide your customers with more value so the purpose of agility right is to help companies better respond to changing demand in the market give customers more of what they want and less of what they don't so yeah that's perfect time to do that
