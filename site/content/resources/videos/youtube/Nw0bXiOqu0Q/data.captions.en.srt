1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,480
the question is why why might recessions

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,420
be a great time to re-evaluate our

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
opportunities with with agile and I

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,500
think it's deeper than that forget the

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
agile story right I think

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,800
um

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,260
the the time when you should be

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
investing the most

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,840
in marketing from a sales perspective

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,780
right when you should be investing the

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,880
most in your people from getting the

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,880
most out of the out of the people that

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,160
you have is is when the world's a

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,840
troubled place around your your

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,100
organization when you're when you're

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,200
when you're struggling and life is

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,860
difficult that's when you should invest

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,660
more time in the people and the

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,539
um and and and getting people to

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,120
understand the markets and add more

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,059
value to your customers right

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,899
so so that

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,000
really brings you back around to that

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,400
agile conversation right we talk about

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,200
agile but what is agile really it's

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,100
about responding to the market more

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,560
quickly

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,360
more quickly that's not English

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,439
responding to the market quicker

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,700
right

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,040
um so we want to respond to the market

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,640
quicker and in order to respond to the

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,799
market quicker we need people

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,320
with the skills and capability to be

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,400
able to respond to the market more

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,840
quickly

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,880
I did it again with uh um with the the

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,560
the

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,420
accountability and

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,520
to be able to do that right that they

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
they are able they feel like they are

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,259
empowered and to be able to go and go

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
and make the changes necessary because

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,880
that was that was the thing from from

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,439
from years and years ago

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,960
um when a lot of the organizational

47
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,899
practices were created it it was

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,759
designed to slow the change in the

49
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,560
organization because the markets were

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,840
slow right you wanted to be able to take

51
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,219
advantage of your market for as as long

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,659
a period as possible because it's going

53
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,239
to exist for a long time so you didn't

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,640
want to change the company let's create

55
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,860
some burratic bureaucratic processes to

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,780
enshrine the way we do things uh push

57
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,879
responsibility up the organization

58
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,319
rather than down and the people at the

59
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,720
top made the decision so the people at

60
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,280
the bottom who are closest to the market

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,420
have to have to realize it has to be

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,860
painful enough because they don't

63
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,480
actually care about your business right

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,099
it has to be painful enough that

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
something's wrong in order for them to

66
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,819
tell their boss that that something's

67
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,739
wrong and then painful enough to go all

68
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,239
the way up the chain to the top and then

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,260
eventually a decision is made to do

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,440
something different and comes all the

71
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,599
way back down own um but the time that

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,640
response comes back down the market

73
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,920
hasn't shifted in the old way but today

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,720
the market that opportunity's gone right

75
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,819
we we don't have that opportunity to

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
take it or we've lost a bunch of money

77
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,760
in the delay it takes to make that

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,260
decision so so I think

79
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,540
um

80
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,540
so I can't think of a better time

81
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,580
to invest

82
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,819
in the ability

83
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,819
capability of your organization

84
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,220
to deliver value

85
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,959
to your customers the more value you

86
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,360
deliver to your customers the more

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,620
favorable your customers will look

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,220
because they're getting a higher return

89
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,500
on investment therefore if there is a

90
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,760
choice in our highly competitive markets

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
then they're going to pick you over the

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,940
competitors

93
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,560
that's that's how you survive a

94
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,140
recession and they don't because you're

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,000
able to more quickly adapt to the market

96
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,440
demand

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,360
and provide your customers with more

98
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,140
value

99
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,440
so the purpose of agility

100
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,840
right is to help companies better

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,519
respond to changing demand in the market

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,260
give customers more of what they want

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,200
and less of what they don't

104
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,200
so yeah that's perfect time to do that
