It’s when things go wrong that you need to explore how best to leverage what you have and align that with value creation for customers.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p><strong>Agile</strong> is simply a great framework and tool to help you do that effectively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>So, it is in times of turmoil that we often discover our deepest opportunities for growth and continuous improvement.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<h2 id=\"h-the-agile-conversation\">The Agile Conversation</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p><strong>Agile</strong> is simply about the ability to adapt and respond to market circumstances and conditions more effectively than your competitors.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It’s about the ability to capture and create value for customers, continuously, in ways that truly delight those customers, which leads to increased customer satisfaction, retention, and acquisition.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>If you’re simply looking for a different way of working, agile isn’t the solution for you.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It needs to solve a problem or create an opportunity for you in a way that traditional project management and conventional product development simply can’t match.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Agile helps provide a framework that helps teams identify whether they have the necessary cross-functional skills to deliver a great product, and to be adaptive and responsive to markets, and if not, develop a plan to acquire those skills.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It’s also about deep market learning and customer sensing to focus on producing the most valuable outcomes for customers and the organization. Empirical Process Control is all about learning through data, feedback, and evidence and using that to inform what you will attempt next.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>In complex environments, we don’t know what we don’t know.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>We don’t know if customers will buy this idea.

That, in turn, has to be equally as painful for that manager for them to escalate it to their boss.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>And so forth, until finally it reaches the leaders, people who are miles away from customers and markets. If it’s painful and inconvenient enough, you might get a decision to change, which then flows down the hierarchy in the form of an order or policy shift.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It’s slow.
