What did an effective Scrum Master's day look like? Probably report writing, probably building some graphs and sending them out to people. Perhaps getting into the daily Scrum so they can get a status update from their team. And then berate them for not working fast enough; it's probably part of their story. Perhaps they're going to make sure that nobody from the business is talking to the developers so that they can control and maintain that relationship. It has a pretty dismal outlook there for anybody who works with this poor Scrum Master that I've come up with.
