1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,400
what what did an effective scrum

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,880
Master's day look like

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,099
uh probably report writing probably uh

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,840
building some graphs and sending them

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,540
out to people

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,240
um perhaps getting into the daily scrum

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,920
so they can get a status update from

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,840
their team

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
um and then berate them for not working

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,619
fast enough it's probably part of their

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,320
story

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,480
um perhaps they're going to make sure

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,820
that nobody from the business is talking

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,120
to the developers so that they can

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,059
control and maintain that relationship

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,640
um it has a pretty pretty dismal Outlook

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,559
there for for anybody who who works with

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,980
this this poor scrum master that I've

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,980
come up with
