I've written bad code and shipped it. That's not technical debt; that's incompetence. Right? So, within the context of a competent team, there's known technical debt and unknown technical debt. But there's another thing that we call technical debt, which is just shipping bad code, making poor choices, knowing that they're poor choices, and not doing anything about it. Right? Shipping bad code. Stop shipping bad code would be the way you pay that one back. 

But for technical debt, you need to pay it back. You need to prioritise paying back that technical debt. Think of it more as an unhedged fund rather than a debt like a credit card. Most debt is secured against something, secured against an asset. If you stop paying your mortgage, then the bank comes and repossesses your house and gets their money back, right? And maybe you get some leftovers because you've paid some of your mortgage.
