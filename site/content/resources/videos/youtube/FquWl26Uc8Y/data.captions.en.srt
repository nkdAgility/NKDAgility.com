1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
I've written bad code and shipped it

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,960
that's not technical debt that's

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,599
incompetence right so so within the

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,160
context of a competent team there's

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,080
known technical debt and unknown

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,440
technical debt but there's another thing

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,320
that we call technical debt which is

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,640
just chipping bad code making poor

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,760
choices knowing that they're poor

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,840
choices and not doing anything about it

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,720
right shipping bad code stop shipping

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
stop shipping bad code would be the way

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,320
you pay that one back but for technical

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,360
debt you need to pay it back you need to

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,399
prioritize paying back that technical

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,760
debt uh think of it more as an unhedged

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,079
fund rather than a debt like a credit

18
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:47,399
card um most debt is secured against

19
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,879
something secured against an asset if

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,800
you stop paying your mortgage then the

21
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,399
bank comes and repossesses your house

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,879
and gets their money back right and

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,760
maybe you get some leftovers because

24
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,760
you've paid some of your mortgage
