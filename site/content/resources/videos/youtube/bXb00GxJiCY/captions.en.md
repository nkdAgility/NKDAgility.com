One of the great benefits of immersive learning is that there's generally less cognitive load. There's less fatigue and tiredness. That video conferencing fatigue that we get from having those 8-hour or multiple consecutive day four-hour sessions is just not there. People can engage for a shorter period of time; they feel more connected to the topics, more connected to the content, and they just don't feel so tired. So we get higher levels of energy, higher levels of excitement, and more engagement from people in the class. And if there's more engagement, there's more learning.
