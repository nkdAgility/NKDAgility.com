00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,920
one of the great benefits of immersive

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,719
learning is that there's generally less

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,080
cognitive load there's less fatigue and

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,960
tiredness that video conferencing

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,880
fatigue that we get from having those uh

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,600
8 hour or multiple consecutive day 4our

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,480
feel more connected to the topics more

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,880
connected to the content and

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,160
they just don't feel so tired so we get

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
higher levels of energy higher levels of

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,640
excitement more engagement from people

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,879
in the class and if there's more

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
