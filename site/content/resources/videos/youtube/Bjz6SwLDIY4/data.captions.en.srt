1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,519
in order to be

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,719
successful we need to constantly

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,679
readjust to to our surroundings right

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,760
things

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:19,560
happen um if you're going through life

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,680
and uh you meet new people uh people

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,039
disappear uh things happen in the world

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,800
right medical things happen uh winning

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,640
the lottery happens all of those things

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:35,280
happen and we as humans are default

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,480
behav behavior is to adapt around those

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,239
situations and the same is true for for

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,039
for businesses right this it's basically

14
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,160
an

15
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:50,239
ecosystem your business exists within a

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:53,399
specific Niche that it um

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,640
developed into right your your business

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,760
grew into one or maybe many niches

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
depending on the size of your

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,920
organization and

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,880
and in those niches things aren't

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,080
constant things are continuously

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,040
changing so in the old days the niches

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,880
used to be there for a really long time

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,200
they used to change very slowly right so

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:24,640
if you were a carpet manufacturer in um

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,159
Islington then um you would be a your

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,159
Market was fairly stable your

29
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,439
competition was fairly fairly low but

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,640
today that's that's not true for any

31
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,200
organization they're very there are

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,920
organizations which don't have

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,600
competitive markets um but they are

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,320
incredibly rare you're probably not one

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,520
of them and if you exist in those highly

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,000
competitive highly Dynamic

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
markets you need to be constantly

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,039
adapting to the needs of those markets

39
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,360
in order to maximize the value that you

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,960
delivered to your customers and maximize

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,079
the the revenue that you create and

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,719
profit that you return uh for your

43
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,880
organization and that requires constant

44
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,239
adaptation constant adaptation to the

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,480
market constant adaptation to changing

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,200
circumstances constant adaptation to

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,800
things that happen in the world that

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,519
affect your business and I think that

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
the the great example of that is when co

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,360
co came along if you were an

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,200
organization um in March of 2020 uh that

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,239
had already embraced the interwebs right

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,800
you already had people working from home

54
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,040
you had already embraced modern security

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,840
practices so you weren't using uh uh VPN

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,959
tunnels into a a specific office

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,280
location um then you probably if you

58
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,319
were already in that modern Camp you

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,760
probably had and your business was

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,800
largely either doing business I.E people

61
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,400
working in an office um then you

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,000
probably had very little impact

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,000
to your business from the work from home

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,640
rules right because people could just go

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,840
work from home and it was cool yeah we

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,400
had to deal with you know we we lost

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,879
some productivity cuz the kids were at

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,959
home as well right we lost some

69
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
productivity because I don't have an

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,720
office in my house and I had to work on

71
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,000
the kitchen table right and there's

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,480
things going on around me but we adapted

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,360
right we adapted to those circumstances

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,360
we adapted um to to what it was we had

75
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,400
to do and we made it work

76
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,200
and that's the genius of of of humans

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:42,000
that's the thing that we're emly uh good

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,599
good at so you don't want to get in the

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,080
way of that inside of your organization

80
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,080
and the way we get in the way of that is

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,480
by creating

82
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,720
rules so companies

83
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,640
organizational uh

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,400
um controls or uh boundaries or

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,840
organizational boundaries should be

86
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,400
maintained using um principles rather

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,959
than rules if you use principles in the

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,560
way you do business um I a guiding

89
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,919
principle

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,320
then you're not constraining people to

91
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,440
the way we currently do things you're

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,960
leaving it open for people to choose

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,800
different ways to do things that those

94
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,280
you might have policies and procedures

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,120
and rules right you might work in a

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,360
regulated industry and here's a bunch of

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,160
stuff we have to do but how you

98
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,280
interpret those things should be fluid

99
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,440
based on the needs of the market while

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,880
still complying with the rules and um

101
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,600
that is probably one of the hardest

102
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,080
things for organizations to adapt to is

103
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,919
that old thinking uh the inter of the

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,560
century Industrial Revolution thinking

105
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,080
that we can just create a bunch of room

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,560
rules a bunch of ways that we work um

107
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,960
and have everybody follow it and we're

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,560
going to continue to be successful those

109
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,759
days were gone in the 1920s they're

110
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,440
completely eradicated by the

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:19,720
1970s um and we all all successful

112
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,600
organizations continuously adapt if you

113
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,840
continuously adapt to your Market why

114
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
don't you continuously adapt to the work

115
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,520
inside of your organization what's

116
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,880
holding you back from making that change

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,120
