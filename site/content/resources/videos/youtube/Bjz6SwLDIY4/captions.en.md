In order to be successful, we need to constantly readjust to our surroundings. Right? Things happen. If you're going through life and you meet new people, people disappear. Things happen in the world, right? Medical things happen. Winning the lottery happens. All of those things happen, and we as humans are default behaviour is to adapt around those situations.

The same is true for businesses, right? It's basically an ecosystem. Your business exists within a specific niche that it developed into. Your business grew into one or maybe many niches, depending on the size of your organisation. In those niches, things aren't constant; things are continuously changing.

So, in the old days, the niches used to be there for a really long time. They used to change very slowly. Right? So if you were a carpet manufacturer in Islington, then your market was fairly stable. Your competition was fairly low. But today, that's not true for any organisation. There are organisations which don't have competitive markets, but they are incredibly rare. You're probably not one of them.

If you exist in those highly competitive, highly dynamic markets, you need to be constantly adapting to the needs of those markets in order to maximise the value that you deliver to your customers and maximise the revenue that you create and profit that you return for your organisation. That requires constant adaptation, constant adaptation to the market, constant adaptation to changing circumstances, constant adaptation to things that happen in the world that affect your business.

I think that the great example of that is when COVID came along. If you were an organisation in March of 2020 that had already embraced the interwebs, right? You already had people working from home. You had already embraced modern security practices, so you weren't using VPN tunnels into a specific office location. Then you probably, if you were already in that modern camp, you probably had, and your business was largely either doing business, i.e. people working in an office, then you probably had very little impact to your business from the work-from-home rules. Right? Because people could just go work from home, and it was cool.

Yeah, we had to deal with, you know, we lost some productivity because the kids were at home as well. Right? We lost some productivity because I don't have an office in my house, and I had to work on the kitchen table. Right? And there's things going on around me. But we adapted. Right? We adapted to those circumstances. We adapted to what it was we had to do, and we made it work.

That's the genius of humans. That's the thing that we're really good at. So you don't want to get in the way of that inside of your organisation. The way we get in the way of that is by creating rules.

So companies, organisational controls or boundaries or organisational boundaries should be maintained using principles rather than rules. If you use principles in the way you do business, i.e. a guiding principle, then you're not constraining people to the way we currently do things. You're leaving it open for people to choose different ways to do things.

You might have policies and procedures and rules, right? You might work in a regulated industry, and here's a bunch of stuff we have to do. But how you interpret those things should be fluid based on the needs of the market while still complying with the rules.

That is probably one of the hardest things for organisations to adapt to, is that old thinking, the Industrial Revolution thinking, that we can just create a bunch of rules, a bunch of ways that we work, and have everybody follow it, and we're going to continue to be successful. Those days were gone in the 1920s. They're completely eradicated by the 1970s.

All successful organisations continuously adapt. If you continuously adapt to your market, why don't you continuously adapt to the work inside of your organisation? What's holding you back from making that change?
