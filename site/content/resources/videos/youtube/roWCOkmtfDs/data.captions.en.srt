1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,440
when you think a feature is going to be

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:11,120
valuable to your customers or to your

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,040
business how do you know that that work

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,880
has actually provided value so been

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,160
working with a a customer recently where

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,960
a lot of um

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,320
sales driven features end up in the

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,359
product um which is actually having the

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,439
impact of fragmenting the product and

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,200
making the product more difficult to use

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,559
because the driving force for adding

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,399
those features to the product is closing

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,800
a

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,879
deal it's get nothing to do with what

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,840
the users of the product want it's got

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,800
nothing to do um with what the business

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,440
that is creating the product want all it

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,160
has to do with is closing the deal with

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,480
the

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,239
customer so what why why is that bad we

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,440
obviously want to close deals with

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,800
customers but why it's bad is because we

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,400
don't

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,479
know whether those things that we're

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,520
creating actually produce value or not

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,600
okay so um they're all there's

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,880
definitely an assumed value right so we

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,040
think if we add this feature we're going

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,119
to get value from it close that deal but

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,680
what's the longterm impact of that

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,560
feature we might close that

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,079
$30,000 deal but if over the next 5

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,640
years that feature is going to cost us

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,240
100,000 in support and maintenance and

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,479
uh all those kind of things and we don't

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,880
close any more deals because of that

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,640
feature then it wasn't worth adding that

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,399
feature to close that $30,000 contract

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,000
but your sales guys don't care because

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,640
they've made their 5% bonus on the

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,320
$30,000 of the deal they closed there's

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,719
no incentive um um for

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,240
them to really focus on the right

44
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,039
features that will support many of their

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,240
customers they're just worried about

46
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,440
closing the deal because that's how they

47
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,760
get the bonus um that's usually the

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,319
metric that

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,440
that that for salespeople so one of the

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,040
ways to turn that around is to start

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,480
changing the way you measure changing

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,959
the way you you you you deliver bonuses

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,519
um because people behave how they're

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,519
measured right so

55
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,840
uh a great great example again Microsoft

56
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,200
has lots of these examples because

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,040
they've been through some of these these

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,159
traumas is they they switched the Azure

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,480
sales folks from getting their bonus

60
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,640
based on the number of azure hours they

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,720
sell to being instead on the number of

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,959
azure hours the customer

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,599
uses so then instead of selling a

64
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,640
million dollars to the

65
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,239
customer and then the customer being

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,599
unhappy at the end of the year year

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,879
because they bought a million dollars

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,480
worth of azure and they've used $40,000

69
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:10,040
and the rest is waste so they're unhappy

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,200
um that the salesperson is focused on

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,920
usage how can I help you as the customer

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,519
use this product not how can I be

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,799
Draconian and close the deal and get you

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,799
to sign on the do line right signing on

75
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,159
the do line is not the value that the

76
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,599
customer wants using the features and

77
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,239
capabilities to the maximum capability

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,720
that they have that's what the customer

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,319
wants and it's that shift and focus from

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,400
um

81
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,840
um Revenue

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,239
extraction right towards value creation

83
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,519
because quite often that shortterm view

84
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,519
on Revenue extraction has a long-term

85
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,239
cost that's not obvious um to to it it's

86
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
not obvious to the people that are

87
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,840
making the decision that the feature

88
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
goes in it might be obvious to the

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
people who are actually doing the work

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
right but they don't have any say or

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,239
control over that so this this valid

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,000
is really important because you pull

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,760
back around and once you've shipped a

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,239
feature

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,239
you monitor that feature's usage you

96
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,079
collect Telemetry from that feature now

97
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,680
in order to collect the right Telemetry

98
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,199
because we can always in hindsight say

99
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,199
well this feature did this right but was

100
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,440
that what was intended is that why you

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
added that feature in the first place is

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,199
that the change that you wanted to make

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
and this is why I have I'm a big

104
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,680
proponent um as part of product

105
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,800
management of hypothesis driven

106
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,440
engineering practices um or it doesn't

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,560
have to be engineering it can be

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,039
anything we're building if we're

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,560
building a product I guess I would just

110
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,960
call that engineering anyway if we're

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,639
building a product um every feature that

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,440
we want to add to the product that is

113
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:04,759
not just table state

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,479
right there are features um that are uh

115
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,440
we just we we we have to have so for

116
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,880
example if you're going to have a

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,080
webbased uh product and there's um

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Dynamic content specific to the user

119
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,800
they're going to have to be able to log

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,520
in I I don't need to have a hypothesis

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
to say is adding login a good idea we

122
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,000
kind of have to have it it's table

123
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,960
Stakes but

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,960
um what level does that go to might

125
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:38,280
include some kind of hypothesis right um

126
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,600
if we make it easier to log in right so

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,960
base username password is is how most

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:48,360
login systems work um most systems are

129
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,639
moving to password lists um if we

130
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,039
Implement a password list system do we

131
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,600
get more or less users using our product

132
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:01,000
if we put a a a LinkedIn Auto login or a

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,560
or a Windows or a um apple or or Google

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,720
auto login Facebook Auto

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,360
login does that increase the number of

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,240
users that we get in the system so the

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,039
hypothesis would be um if we add the

138
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,400
capability for people to L in with

139
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,479
Facebook um we're going to get a higher

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,479
number of people logging into the system

141
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,160
because it's easier for them to log in

142
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,440
right that would be a hypothesis and

143
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,360
then you might ask the question well how

144
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,160
how much more is that worth um and

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,720
hopefully it's very minimal F that sort

146
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,800
of thing should be very minimal effort

147
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,840
to add to your system right should be

148
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,039
not saying it will be but it should be

149
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,160
um if you add that to your

150
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,080
system what data are you going to

151
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,440
collect to know whether you've

152
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,840
successfully achieved that hypothesis

153
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
well I I I want to I want to know how

154
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,280
many people click the Facebook Link

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,800
versus us the username and

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,639
password right and I also want to know

157
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,560
the total number of people new net new

158
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,840
users coming onto the system so what I

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,120
would expect to see is you know we've

160
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,199
got our line for new users in the system

161
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,599
U we add that feature and that line has

162
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,039
a something noticeable that says we're

163
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,560
increasing at a higher rate right and

164
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,759
then we can look at the data and say

165
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,800
well um 10% of people clicked the

166
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,360
Facebook button we've got a 10% increase

167
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,160
in the net new users therefore we've

168
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,080
opened up access to new users and New

169
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,960
Market that less people go to the page

170
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,560
and then bounce more people go to the

171
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,800
page and then sign in just because it's

172
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,160
easy they can just click the button um

173
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,879
so that's hypothesis driven practices we

174
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,240
have to look at the data and figure out

175
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,000
whether um the thing that we added has

176
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,400
the result that we expect but this is

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,360
the important part that means um whose

178
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,680
job is it to provide the

179
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,960
hypothesis it could be the person who

180
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,120
wants the feature who's asking for the

181
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
feature right this is this is something

182
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,080
that I encouraged I customer recently I

183
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,280
encouraged them to push back to sales

184
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,520
right so if sales say we want feature X

185
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,319
because we think it's going to close

186
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,560
this deal right and this deal is worth x

187
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,319
amount of money engineering should say

188
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,080
well

189
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,639
how much other customers are going to

190
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
use the feature how much do we think

191
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,960
it's going to increase usage of the

192
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,440
product um

193
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,719
and I'd like you guys to come up with a

194
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
hypothesis of why we're adding this

195
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,440
feature and what we expect to be

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,279
different other than just closing that

197
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,039
deal because we want to look at the

198
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,959
total cost total cost of ownership let's

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,959
say over five years of adding a feature

200
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,480
so support and maintenance and testing

201
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,360
and automated testing and all of those

202
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,200
things what's What's the total total

203
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,959
total cost of that the amount of time it

204
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,880
adds to the build right all those kind

205
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,800
of things and a lot of that gesses but

206
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,760
we come up with here's what we think it

207
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,800
will cost

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
that's are we actually going to make the

209
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,000
money that back that we're putting in is

210
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,560
it is it enough of a difference to make

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,079
it worth doing if we do it what else is

212
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,640
it going to support how many other

213
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:18,399
customers is it going to help um and

214
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,440
that's the Clincher do you understand um

215
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,720
how

216
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
many customers are using the features

217
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,800
that you have in your product I think

218
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,600
the there's some data from the sish

219
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,160
group in in Boston used to create the

220
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,959
chaos report I think they still do

221
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,640
create a report called the chaos report

222
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,640
every year might have a new name now um

223
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,079
and in that report they've they they

224
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,720
collect data they're an data analysts

225
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:45,760
group they collect data across I think

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,200
it's about 70 75,000 projects worldwide

227
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,640
um mostly us and Europe but some rest of

228
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,320
the world I think it's like 60% us 30%

229
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,959
Europe and then 10% of the rest of the

230
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,279
world I can't remember exactly but I

231
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,399
seem to remember remember those numbers

232
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:06,640
could be making them up

233
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:09,680
but the data that they analyzed showed

234
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,800
that only 35% of the features that we

235
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:17,839
build in our products are actually used

236
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:21,320
by our customers I think it's um uh

237
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,000
used it could be used a little bit but

238
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,160
not enough to make it worth adding to

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,519
the to the to the to the product so

240
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,480
they've analyzed that across all these

241
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,120
products so why is that number so low

242
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,680
because that sounds like for every

243
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,560
million dollars you invest in your

244
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,600
product you're only getting

245
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,519
$350,000 worth of

246
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,279
value right so

247
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,279
that's a lot of waste that's

248
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,360
$650,000

249
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,360
waste that's a lot of money where's it

250
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,360
going why why why are we building

251
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,720
features that our customers aren't using

252
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,000
even worse why are we continuing to

253
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
invest in

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
features that we could know that our

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,720
customers aren't

256
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,760
using that's that's the even more

257
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,320
interesting question how many features

258
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,880
do you track the usage of features in

259
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,360
your product and how many features in

260
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,720
your product are you actively adding new

261
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,959
functionality to that your customers

262
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,040
don't use that because if they're not

263
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,839
using it you probably want to think

264
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,040
twice about adding new features you may

265
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,200
want to double down right you've got

266
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,240
that old a adage that we can either H

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
double down right so we keep investing

268
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,800
in that feature because we think it's

269
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,079
going to be valuable in the future and

270
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:45,360
customers will use it we pivot we need

271
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:47,320
to change the way that feature Works in

272
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,639
order to maximize the user user

273
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,839
engagement with it right which is means

274
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,639
it's valuable if they're engaging with

275
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,399
it um or or we stop investing in it and

276
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,839
perhaps take it out the product

277
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,800
how often do you make those decisions

278
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,800
and how often do you make those

279
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,440
decisions based on data do you have the

280
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,079
data to be able to make those

281
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,800
decisions th this is something that that

282
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,839
product management wants the data the

283
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,720
only way they can get the data is if the

284
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,519
team adds that capability into the

285
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,560
product it needs to be integrated with

286
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,199
the product because you want to be

287
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,440
looking at the actual features how they

288
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,720
work and create Telemetry specific to

289
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,519
those features

290
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,240
understand based on what you intended

291
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,839
the feature to do that you're able to

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,480
track that data see the needles moving

293
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,519
and decide whether to continue investing

294
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
in it or stop that's something that

295
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,760
every product manager every product

296
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,720
owner should have for almost every

297
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,720
feature they add um to the product or

298
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,560
the intent to add to the product and

299
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,360
that can be great feedback and

300
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,680
information you can use when you're

301
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,000
talking to stakeholders who've asked for

302
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,120
those features and um you know you

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,800
before you've built the whole

304
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,920
feature build a little bit of it

305
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,680
validate that it's the right feature and

306
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,360
you see there's very few people using it

307
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,920
and go back to the stakeholder and say

308
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,800
we don't want to keep investing in this

309
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,560
feature because nobody's using it do you

310
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,120
know why nobody's using it right no you

311
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,360
can go ask the customers as well but

312
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,959
this is your push back on that Financial

313
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
investment that's maybe been imposed

314
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,839
upon you if you don't control everything

315
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,959
so validation is a super important part

316
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:39,480
of product development it's often

317
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:43,320
lacking um I feel that it's more often

318
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,399
lacking than almost anything else uh in

319
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,360
in product development uh so go out

320
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,480
there figure out what Telemetry you need

321
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,880
in your product get your engineers to

322
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,880
build it and start making evidencebased

323
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,040
uh decisions and validate that the

324
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,519
features that you create actually adding

325
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,519
the value that you intended for them
