1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,639
the applying scaling portfolio cbank

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:11,880
class is really about how do we look at

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,240
our system no longer at the team level

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,279
and but how do we look at our system at

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,400
the at the organization level at the

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,240
program level um and what how how do we

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,199
then

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,000
understand analyze the work and create

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:33,680
create effective strategies for enabling

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,960
that flow of of uh uh uh portfolio items

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,200
through our system to increase the

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,840
amount of value that we deliver for our

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,680
products to to to increase

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
predictability so that we can um have a

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,480
better understanding of which things are

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,719
likely success to be successful which

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,399
things we need to cut our losses on um

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,399
which things need to be changed

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,160
drastically in order to to to result in

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,480
that value acrel and so it really

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,559

things into production um and they need

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,159

organizations understand the current

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,439
flow through their system and ask more

interesting questions about what they

41
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,640
can do differently to improve the flow
