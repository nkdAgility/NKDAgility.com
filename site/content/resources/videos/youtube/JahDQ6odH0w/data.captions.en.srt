not alone If you're a CTO right now it

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,160
probably feels like you're drowning in

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,560

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
research every trend You can't test

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,079
every idea And you definitely can't

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,480
