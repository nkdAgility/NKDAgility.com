if you're having a conversation about

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,480
caman V scrum you probably don't

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,000
understand caman very well caman is a

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,599
strategy that you can apply to any

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,520
system any process to gain deeper

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,080
insights and understandings of that

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,439
system and process so that you can

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,560
optimize it to increase the flow of

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,400
value through that system so it's not

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,920
scrum these caman it's scrum and caman

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,280
always if you're using a another system

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,079
it's that system and caman always so you

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,680
can see what's going on cban is a tool

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,399
to increase transparency for any system

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,640
for any type of work in any situation

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,559
and it will always add value to the

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,559
conversation
