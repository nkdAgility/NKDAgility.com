If you're talking about [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) versus [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}), chances are you might not fully understand what Kanban is all about. Kanban isnâ€™t a rival or alternative to Scrumâ€”itâ€™s a strategy that can complement any system or process. Whether youâ€™re working with Scrum or any other system, integrating Kanban can help you gain deeper insights and improve the overall flow of value.

In this post, weâ€™ll explore how **Kanban** works within the context of Scrum, how it brings [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}), and why itâ€™s a powerful tool for optimizing your processes. As a [professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) Trainer, Iâ€™ll share personal experiences and recommendations to help you leverage Kanban in your Scrum practices.

## Kanban and Scrum: Not a Choice, But a Partnership

### Misunderstanding the Relationship

One of the most common misunderstandings I come across in my work as a Scrum Trainer is people thinking they have to choose between **Kanban and Scrum**. But hereâ€™s the truth: itâ€™s not a matter of Kanban _versus_ Scrum; itâ€™s always about **Kanban and Scrum together**.

#### Why Kanban Fits With Scrum:

- **Kanban enhances Scrum** by improving the transparency of work in progress.

- **Itâ€™s a tool** that complements the Scrum framework, rather than replaces it.

- **Kanban can be applied** to any system or process, not just Scrum. Itâ€™s a universal strategy.

For instance, Iâ€™ve worked with teams who struggled to manage their work-in-progress (WIP) limits in Scrum. By introducing Kanban alongside their Scrum framework, we were able to visualize their workflow better, identify bottlenecks, and improve efficiency. This isnâ€™t an either-or situation; Kanban and Scrum work beautifully together to create more value for teams and stakeholders.

* * *

## What is Kanban, Exactly?

To put it simply, **Kanban** is a strategy that helps you understand any system or process more deeply. It increases transparency and gives you the ability to optimize that system by improving the flow of value.

### Key Concepts in Kanban:

- **Visualizing your workflow**: Kanban boards make your process visible, so you can see whatâ€™s going on at any given time.

- **Limiting work in progress (WIP)**: This helps teams stay focused and avoid overloading.

- **Managing flow**: You can track how work moves through the process and identify bottlenecks.

- **[Continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}})**: Kanban encourages teams to keep improving the process and flow of work.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** If your team is struggling with too many tasks in progress, a Kanban board can help you visually limit the WIP and maintain focus on delivering value.

* * *

## Kanban's Value in Any System

Kanban isnâ€™t just limited to Scrum or [Agile frameworks]({{< ref "/tags/agile-frameworks" >}})â€”itâ€™s applicable to any kind of work. Whether youâ€™re in a marketing department, a [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) team, or a manufacturing plant, Kanban can bring value by improving transparency and efficiency.

### How Kanban Adds Value:

- **Increases visibility**: You can instantly see where tasks are in the workflow.

- **Enhances communication**: Teams have clearer insights into progress and obstacles.

- **Improves decision-making**: By identifying bottlenecks, you can make informed decisions to optimize the process.

- **Reduces waste**: Limiting work in progress means focusing on tasks that truly matter and reducing unnecessary work.

I once worked with a non-IT team that was overwhelmed by a chaotic backlog. By implementing a Kanban board, they could visualize all their tasks and streamline their workflow. This allowed them to focus on high-priority items, which led to increased efficiency and reduced stress. Kanban isnâ€™t tied to technology or specific industriesâ€”itâ€™s a versatile tool that fits anywhere.

## Integrating Kanban and Scrum

So, how do you actually integrate Kanban with Scrum? Itâ€™s simpler than you might think.

### Steps to Combine Kanban and Scrum:

1. **Start with transparency**: Use a Kanban board to visualize your [Scrum team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}})â€™s workflow.

3. **Set WIP limits**: This helps Scrum teams avoid taking on too much at once, a common challenge when sprint goals are set.

5. **Track flow and bottlenecks**: Use Kanbanâ€™s emphasis on flow to identify where work is getting stuck.

7. **Continue Scrum ceremonies**: Scrum events like sprint planning, sprint reviews, and daily standups still hold their importance, but now you have more data to work with.

9. **Apply Kanban principles**: The Kanban principles of limiting WIP and managing flow enhance your Scrum processes.

By adding Kanban principles into Scrum, teams can manage their sprints more effectively. Iâ€™ve personally seen teams reduce their [cycle time]({{< ref "/tags/cycle-time" >}}) significantly after adopting this hybrid approach. Kanban gives teams real-time feedback on their workflow, which allows them to make data-driven decisions during sprint retrospectives.

## Real-Life Example: Kanban and Scrum in Action

In one of my [coaching]({{< ref "/tags/coaching" >}}) experiences, I worked with a team that was constantly missing their sprint goals. The team was struggling to visualize what was happening between different stages of their work. By integrating a Kanban board into their existing Scrum practices, we were able to see exactly where the delays were happening.

### What We Did:

- **Set up a Kanban board** to visualize work at each stage.

- **Implemented WIP limits** to reduce the number of tasks in progress at any given time.

- **Analyzed the flow** and adjusted processes to eliminate bottlenecks.

After a few sprints of using both **Scrum and Kanban**, the team was hitting their sprint goals consistently. The ability to see the workflow in real-time helped them make better decisions and deliver more value to their stakeholders.

* * *

## Why You Should Adopt Kanban in Your Scrum Process

If your team is struggling with transparency, bottlenecks, or missed sprint goals, it might be time to consider adding Kanban to your Scrum process. Here are some of the main benefits:

### Key Benefits of Using Kanban with Scrum:

- **Improved transparency**: You can see where every piece of work is at all times.

- **Better focus**: WIP limits keep the team from getting overwhelmed.

- **Faster feedback**: You can identify bottlenecks and resolve them quickly.

- **Increased flexibility**: Kanban allows teams to adapt their process continuously.

- **Better collaboration**: A visual board fosters better communication within the team and with stakeholders.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Donâ€™t be afraid to experiment! Try combining Kanban and Scrum and see how it works for your team. Youâ€™ll likely find that it brings a new level of clarity and efficiency to your process.

## Final Thoughts: Kanban and Scrum Are Stronger Together

Kanban isnâ€™t here to replace Scrumâ€”itâ€™s here to **enhance it**. By bringing transparency, improving flow, and encouraging continuous improvement, Kanban can help your Scrum team deliver even more value.

If youâ€™re struggling to keep up with sprint goals or feel like your team isnâ€™t as efficient as it could be, try implementing Kanban principles. Youâ€™ll gain deeper insights into your workflow, improve decision-making, and ultimately increase the flow of value through your system.

**Remember**: Itâ€™s always Scrum _and_ Kanban, not one or the other. ðŸŒŸ **Take Action**: Set up a Kanban board with your team today and start experimenting. You might be surprised by how quickly you see results!
