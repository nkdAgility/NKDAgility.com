The focus is largely on process optimization (transparency, flow, WIP) within the team. There is little reference to customer feedback as a driver of improvement or evidence-based prioritization based on customer outcomes—core to the Customer Focus category.

However, the article never directly uses the term 'Definition of Workflow' or explicitly describes it as a set of explicit team agreements or policies about workflow entry/exit criteria. It provides substantial conceptual alignment by describing visualization, WIP limits, process adaptation, and continuous improvement within a Kanban-Scrum hybrid, frequently mentioning how Kanban makes workflow visible and manageable. The discussion is practical and moderately deep, with real-life implementation examples and recommendations for practitioners. The primary intent is to inform and support agile teams, aligning well with the intended audience. There's some dilution as the focus shifts between general Kanban benefits, its integration with Scrum, and teamwork, so the signal-to-noise is not maximal. As there are no outdated or critical tones, no penalties are warranted. The confidence score reflects strong conceptual alignment and practical depth, though the lack of a direct, explicit treatment of Definition of Workflow in the strict Kanban Guide sense moderates the result.",
