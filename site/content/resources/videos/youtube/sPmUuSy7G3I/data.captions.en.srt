1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,300
the question is how does the the a scrum

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,920
team plan and prioritize work

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,540
effectively let's leave aside for a

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,720
moment that the word prioritizes

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,000
singular rather than uh plural because

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,279
that always always triggers me a little

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,100
bit but

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
um the the how do they plan and

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,859
prioritize and that's actually

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,500
it's actually quite difficult because it

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,760
it depends on the business it depends on

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,680
the organizer like what is the business

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,059
trying to achieve

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,040
the the the work flows from the business

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,260
so you need to understand what the what

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,039
the business is trying to achieve what

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,579
are their goals where are they going and

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,079
then align the work

19
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,079
towards those goals and outcomes and

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,320
how they might actually do it they

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,100
they might

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,619
um

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,840
they might do sizing right I'm trying to

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,400
avoid the e word right the estimation

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,760
word

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,680
um they they they might do they might do

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,240
they might do some form of sizing right

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,560
we want to figure out how big some of

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,979
these things are because that's going to

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,259
impact on the ROI of the item

31
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,479
um they need to understand well how

32
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,920
valuable is this item which is a bigger

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,840
problem because now the business needs

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,640
to understand what value is Right which

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,799
is a whole whole bigger problem for the

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,200
product owner and once you kind of

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,259
understand how much how much how much

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,180
value there is and you understand how

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,040
how big things are

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,479
you also probably want to understand how

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,700
risky

42
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,259
things how much risk is involved in this

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,060
item

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,000
um

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:58,619
and with all of that information then we

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,220
can start to figure out uh um like value

47
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,860
minus risk divided by size there's a

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,020
poor man's order of your your product

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,959
backlog right there's a first order and

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,819
then you could Nuance it from there but

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,800
the reality is that I I really don't

52
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,280
expect people to have that many things

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,540
in their product backlog the the one of

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,720
the most important things that folks can

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,080
do to help plan and prioritize the work

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,319
is not have so much crap to plan and

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,180
prioritize right and if you've got 5 000

58
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,800
things in your product backlog it's not

59
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,560
a product backlog it's a Dumping Ground

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
right there's there's no 5 000 things

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,940
that the product owner and the scrum

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,459
team and the stakeholders can actually

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,040
understand

64
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,739
what is in there and what this thing is

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,760
they would need to

66
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,160
um

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,220
um remove as many of those things as

68
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,660
possible get rid of the the the

69
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,180
I don't know all the stuff that's just

70
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,300
getting why is there so many weeds in

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,280
the way to try and find the value that

72
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,440
you need to need to deliver the best

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,060
product backlogs are small

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
um the best product backlogs are

75
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,959
probably

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,019
um two or looking two or three Sprints

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,120
into the future maybe a little bit more

78
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,860
if you're a large organization but the

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,680
further out into the future you look the

80
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,680
kind of higher level the item is

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,140
therefore it's less granular and there's

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,540
less detail I.E less weeds right because

83
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,580
it's a big thing it's a tree rather than

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,060
being a plant that you can go deal with

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:39,720
and move around and I think

86
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,700
that that d scaling de-escalation

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,319
removing as much as possible so that

88
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,420
they can focus

89
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,940
they can focus on the things that

90
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,760
they're trying to create what is what is

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,379
what is the business trying to achieve

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,620
select the things that go towards that

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:58,500
achieving that business goal and iterate

94
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,659
right you need to be collecting data and

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,180
looking at are we actually being

96
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,659
successful one of the key key pieces to

97
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,060
to to planning and prioritization is are

98
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,200
we even working on the right thing and

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,480
how do you know if you're working on the

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,340
right thing if you have no collected no

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
data to understand how your customers

102
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,739
are using it what your customers want

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,299
um You're Building features are they

104
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,979
still being used by your customers

105
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,020
should you be removing stuff from your

106
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,960
products instead of adding it I think it

107
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,520
it all comes down to a massive of of of

108
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:35,220
data analysis and understanding of

109
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,380
um what it is that that you're trying to

110
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,660
achieve so merging those those long-term

111
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,180
goals of the business with the

112
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,840
short-term goals of the product and the

113
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,100
data to back up to validate your

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,100
hypothesis right
