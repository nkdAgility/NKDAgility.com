the question is how does the scrum team plan and prioritize work effectively let's leave aside for a moment that the word prioritizes singular rather than plural because that always triggers me a little bit but um the how do they plan and prioritize and that's actually it's actually quite difficult because it depends on the business it depends on the organizer like what is the business trying to achieve the work flows from the business so you need to understand what the business is trying to achieve what are their goals where are they going and then align the work towards those goals and outcomes and how they might actually do it they might um they might do sizing right I'm trying to avoid the e word right the estimation word um they might do they might do some form of sizing right we want to figure out how big some of these things are because that's going to impact on the ROI of the item um they need to understand well how valuable is this item which is a bigger problem because now the business needs to understand what value is right which is a whole whole bigger problem for the product owner and once you kind of understand how much how much how much value there is and you understand how how big things are you also probably want to understand how risky things how much risk is involved in this item um and with all of that information then we can start to figure out uh um like value minus risk divided by size there's a poor man's order of your product backlog right there's a first order and then you could nuance it from there but the reality is that I really don't expect people to have that many things in their product backlog the one of the most important things that folks can do to help plan and prioritize the work is not have so much crap to plan and prioritize right and if you've got 5,000 things in your product backlog it's not a product backlog it's a dumping ground right there's there's no 5,000 things that the product owner and the scrum team and the stakeholders can actually understand what is in there and what this thing is they would need to um remove as many of those things as possible get rid of the the the I don't know all the stuff that's just getting why is there so many weeds in the way to try and find the value that you need to need to deliver the best product backlogs are small um the best product backlogs are probably um two or looking two or three sprints into the future maybe a little bit more if you're a large organization but the further out into the future you look the kind of higher level the item is therefore it's less granular and there's less detail i.e. less weeds right because it's a big thing it's a tree rather than being a plant that you can go deal with and move around and I think that that de-scaling de-escalation removing as much as possible so that they can focus they can focus on the things that they're trying to create what is what is what is the business trying to achieve select the things that go towards that achieving that business goal and iterate right you need to be collecting data and looking at are we actually being successful one of the key key pieces to to planning and prioritization is are we even working on the right thing and how do you know if you're working on the right thing if you have no collected no data to understand how your customers are using it what your customers want um you're building features are they still being used by your customers should you be removing stuff from your products instead of adding it I think it all comes down to a massive of data analysis and understanding of um what it is that that you're trying to achieve so merging those those long-term goals of the business with the short-term goals of the product and the data to back up to validate your hypothesis right thanks for watching the video if you enjoyed it please like follow and subscribe I always reply to comments and if you want to have a chat about this or anything else agile scrum or devops then please book a coffee with me through naked agility
