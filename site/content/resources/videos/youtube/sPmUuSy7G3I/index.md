 In a #projectmanagement environment, the people doing the work are often separated from the customers and project stakeholders they are doing the work for. The #projectmanager runs interference and acts as the bridge between what needs doing and what is being done.

In #agile, we believe in bringing #scrumteams, #customers, and #productstakeholders together to ensure that everyone is clear on what needs doing, what that matters, and how it will impact the customer environment.

The #productowner is ultimately responsible for prioritizing and ordering the #productbacklog, but more often than not it is a process of cocreation. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about how a #scrumteam can effectively plan and prioritize work.
