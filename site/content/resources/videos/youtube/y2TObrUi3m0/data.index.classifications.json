It discusses decision-making, adaptation, and coaching grounded in principles. However, the term 'ethos' is never directly mentioned, and while the conviction behind the advocacy is evident, the analysis stops short of deeply exploring system-level ethos, evidence through outcomes, or differentiating ethos from mindsets or rituals—key hallmarks of the category. The audience and intent align well for practitioners and coaches, but the discussion remains at the level of principles, not extensively dissecting ethos as the system-level foundation. Signal-to-noise is moderate—some content is networking-oriented or general advocacy.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article champions core Agile principles as key to real success, deliberately moving the spotlight away from tools and surface-level frameworks. While conceptually close to Ethos, it doesn’t explicitly analyze underlying convictions or systemic evidence of values.

The distinction between first and derived principles is not explored, nor are theoretical sources or explicit linkages to foundational theorists. The discussion stays at a level of urging focus on principles as better guidance, but references to first principles are indirect and generic, with no breakdown of what those irreducible truths are or their structural consequences.
