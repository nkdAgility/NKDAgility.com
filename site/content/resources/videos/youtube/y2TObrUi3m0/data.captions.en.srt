1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,000
so what the question is what should be

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,280
way more popular in in agile

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,719
than it is today

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,719
and I think it's

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,039
the opposite of tools

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,100
so the main the main focus of agile

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,580
coaches agile consultants and people

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,279
actually trying to do Agile

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,280
um seems to be tools right the focus is

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,180
on the tools but the tools aren't how

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,340
you

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
figure out how to solve problems in a

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,360
complex environment because in a complex

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,980
environment you might need different

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,239
tools every time you do something you

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,160
might need a different practice a

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,440
different capability a different an

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,680
emergent process right

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,340
so the thing that I think is missing

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,020
is that focus on principles right

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,500
because the principles are the thing

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,300
that are underlying everything and

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,580
helping you make

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,799
choices that fit within the direction

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,240
that you want to go of of your

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,720
organization and the way you want to do

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,360
things and the tools are just something

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,299
that supports those

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,770
ideas right those those practice those

30
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,200
those

31
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,759
[Music]

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,200
um

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,740
principles

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,960
so I think the the big lack of focus is

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,560
on the underlying principles that

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,320
support the good decision making that

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,079
results in great organizations great

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,500
teams and great products and it's just

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,500
not there

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,560
