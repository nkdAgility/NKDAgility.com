So what the question is what should be way more popular in agile than it is today. 

I think it's the opposite of tools. 

So the main focus of agile coaches, agile consultants and people actually trying to do Agile seems to be tools, right? The focus is on the tools, but the tools aren't how you figure out how to solve problems in a complex environment. Because in a complex environment you might need different tools every time you do something. You might need a different practice, a different capability, a different emergent process, right? 

So the thing that I think is missing is that focus on principles, right? Because the principles are the thing that are underlying everything and helping you make choices that fit within the direction that you want to go of your organization and the way you want to do things. And the tools are just something that supports those ideas, right? Those practices, those principles. 

So I think the big lack of focus is on the underlying principles that support the good decision making that results in great organizations, great teams and great products. And it's just not there.
