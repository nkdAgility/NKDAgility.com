There are three core principles of Caman. To keep it really simple, there's defining and visualising your workflow. That's like creating your rule book as a team. How are you going to function? What does your system look like? 

So, defining and visualising a workflow. The second core principle is to actively manage the items in the workflow. Now that you can see them, you can see what's going on. You have a visualisation, so you're going to actively take action. You're not just going to passively look at it; actively take action. 

Then, the third principle is improving your workflow. You want to make changes to the workflow in order to make things a little bit better, to make things flow better through your system.
