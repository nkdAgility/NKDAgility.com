    "reasoning": "Direct mention of 'Agentic Engineering' does not appear; the focus is on the definition of done as a practice for improving delivery and value. There's moderate conceptual overlap in emphasizing team autonomy, evolving practices, and outcome orientation, but it does not deeply explore maximizing human or AI agency, nor systemic feedback or observability as core themes. The depth remains practical and process-focused, with limited philosophical or agentic framing. Intent is aligned with practical improvement for technical teams but does not adopt, critique, or advance agentic engineering as a field. The audience is technical, with strong practitioner relevance, but the discussion is not tailored to agentic engineering proponents. Most of the content is focused and actionable with little filler.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The article focuses on 'definition of done' as a team competency for value delivery, showing moderate relevance to Agentic Engineering through autonomy and improvement themes but without directly addressing agency or systemic feedback as defined in the category.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the importance of a strong Definition of Done (DoD) for driving team performance, business value, and competitive advantage. However, it does not explicitly mention or discuss agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, their integration with human expertise, or related technical or governance practices. The themes are more general Agile, Scrum, and delivery excellence, without reference to context-aware agents, automation intelligence, or human-in-the-loop approaches as described in the category definition. Thus, conceptual alignment and depth are quite low. The content targets a similar audience (software delivery practitioners), but lacks the agentic focus necessary for higher confidence. No penalties are warranted because the content is neither outdated nor oppositional.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is focused on Agile/DoD best practices with no mention or meaningful discussion of agentic software delivery or autonomous agents. The topic is only weakly aligned with the category and does not address its core themes.",
