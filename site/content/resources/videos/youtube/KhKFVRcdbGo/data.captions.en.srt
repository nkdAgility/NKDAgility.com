00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,240
naked agility helps

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:11,320
organizations create culture of

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,360
engineering Excellence do we I I'm I'm I

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,039
I struggle with the idea of creating

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,160
culture culture is just what is within

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,960
the organization but what we can help

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,760
you

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,080
do think of culture as the shadow on the

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,599
wall right you need to change the shape

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,599
of the thing in order to change the

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,720
shadow in the wall and naked agility can

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,600
help

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,800
you understand your current system of

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,079
delivering value in order to

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,559
measure the things

16
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,120
that make an

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,960
impact on where you want to go and what

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:55,680
you want to achieve in order to create

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,120
the highest value optimization that we

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,920
can have within within within your

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,280
context so we do that by by monitoring

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,920
the system identifying what your system

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,439
is defining that

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,640
system of delivering

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:19,320
value and then creating or helping you

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,040
create metrics and understanding and

27
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,520
transparency of that system so that you

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,960
can see what's going on and make better

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,400
decisions that enable you to get to the

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
outcomes that you're trying to achieve

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,920
which could be it could be reducing cost

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,200
it could be maximizing value I would go

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,360
for the maximizing value to be

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,840
honest but this idea

35
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,040
of technical leadership and Engineering

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,759
Excellence within the context of

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,680
building software

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,280
products is that overall ethos of

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,439
understanding your system measuring it

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,119
so you can see what's going on and then

41
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,200
making substantive changes to that

42
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,280
system to see whether you're able to

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,879
optimize the goals and outcomes that

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,080
