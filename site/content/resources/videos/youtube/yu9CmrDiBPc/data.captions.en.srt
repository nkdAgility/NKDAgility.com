1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,120
hex Stacks can scale but can your

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,719
culture that's the real question because

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,400
scaling technology is the easy part you

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,280
add more servers more clusters more

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
Automation and you're done but if your

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,199
engineering culture doesn't scale with

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,920
it you're setting yourself up for

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,680
failure and the worst part you won't

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,880
even see it coming till it's too late

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,240
when your teams grow when complexity

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679
increases when the pressure mounts to

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,879
deliver faster your culture is either

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,360
your greatest asset or your biggest

14
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:38,200
liability collaboration starts to break

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,559
down devops becomes a buzzword instead

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,600
of enabler continuous learning it turns

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,800
into an

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,079
afterthought and that's where so many

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,399
organizations hit a wall they think they

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,600
can just throw more tools at the problem

21
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,160
more jir more dashboards more standups

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,680
more daily

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,320
scrums but culture isn't a tool problem

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,760
it's an ethos problem a philosophical

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,119
problem and if you don't build a culture

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,560
designed to scale all the tools in the

27
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,000
world won't save

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,439
you that's what we do at nak agility we

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,159
help companies not just grow but grow

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
right building a culture that scales

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,680
within your teams your goals your

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,240
Ambitions a culture where collaboration

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,439
isn't forced devops isn't just

34
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,799
Automation and learning isn't a one-time

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,320
event it's just how you

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,840
operate because at the end of the day

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,280
the companies that win they're not the

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,159
ones with the best tech they're the ones

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
with the best culture so is yours ready

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,799
to scale
