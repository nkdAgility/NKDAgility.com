 # CI/CD Done Right: Engineering Excellence with Continuous Integration and Delivery | Martin Hinshelwood  

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I unpack the real meaning of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**‚Äîand why most teams aren‚Äôt doing it right. From mainline branching to ring-based deployments, I explore how CI/CD pipelines can help teams reduce risk, improve product quality, and achieve faster, more reliable releases. Let‚Äôs redefine what CI/CD should look like and how it can transform your development process.

**üìå Chapters:**  

1. 00:00 ‚Äì Introduction: The Problem with ‚ÄúFake CI/CD‚Äù  
2. 02:30 ‚Äì What Continuous Integration Really Means  
3. 05:00 ‚Äì Why Mainline Branching is Critical  
4. 08:15 ‚Äì Continuous Delivery: Shipping Directly to Production  
5. 11:30 ‚Äì Ring-Based Deployment Models for Controlled Risk  
6. 15:45 ‚Äì The Role of Automation in CI/CD  
7. 19:30 ‚Äì Adapting CI/CD to Fit Your Product and Business Goals  

**üéØ Who This Video is For:**  

- Developers and engineering teams looking to adopt true CI/CD practices  
- Product owners and business leaders aiming to improve release frequency and quality  
- Organizations struggling with complex branching models or deployment bottlenecks  

**üìñ What You‚Äôll Learn:**  

- The difference between automated builds and true CI/CD  
- Why DevTestLive branches are outdated and risky  
- How mainline branching reduces integration issues and supports continuous delivery  
- The benefits of ring-based deployments for managing risk and gathering feedback  
- Strategies for automating CI/CD pipelines to reduce costs and improve efficiency  
- Real-world examples from Microsoft‚Äôs deployment models  

**üí° Key Takeaways:**  

- Continuous Integration means frequent merges into a mainline branch, not separate branch builds.  
- Continuous Delivery ensures every commit is deployable to production, reducing deployment friction.  
- Ring-based deployments allow teams to manage risk while iterating quickly.  
- CI/CD isn‚Äôt one-size-fits-all‚Äîtailoring it to your product and goals is key.
