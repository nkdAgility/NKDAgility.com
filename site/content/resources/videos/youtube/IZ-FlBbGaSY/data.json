    "description": "# CI/CD Done Right: Engineering Excellence with Continuous Integration and Delivery | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I unpack the real meaning of **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)**—and why most teams aren’t doing it right. From mainline branching to ring-based deployments, I explore how CI/CD pipelines can help teams reduce risk, improve product quality, and achieve faster, more reliable releases. Let’s redefine what CI/CD should look like and how it can transform your development process.\n\n**📌 Chapters:**  \n\n1. 00:00 – Introduction: The Problem with “Fake CI/CD”  \n2. 02:30 – What Continuous Integration Really Means  \n3. 05:00 – Why Mainline Branching is Critical  \n4. 08:15 – Continuous Delivery: Shipping Directly to Production  \n5. 11:30 – Ring-Based Deployment Models for Controlled Risk  \n6. 15:45 – The Role of Automation in CI/CD  \n7. 19:30 – Adapting CI/CD to Fit Your Product and Business Goals  \n\n**🎯 Who This Video is For:**  \n\n- Developers and engineering teams looking to adopt true CI/CD practices  \n- Product owners and business leaders aiming to improve release frequency and quality  \n- Organizations struggling with complex branching models or deployment bottlenecks  \n\n**📖 What You’ll Learn:**  \n\n- The difference between automated builds and true CI/CD  \n- Why DevTestLive branches are outdated and risky  \n- How mainline branching reduces integration issues and supports continuous delivery  \n- The benefits of ring-based deployments for managing risk and gathering feedback  \n- Strategies for automating CI/CD pipelines to reduce costs and improve efficiency  \n- Real-world examples from Microsoft’s deployment models  \n\n**💡 Key Takeaways:**  \n\n- Continuous Integration means frequent merges into a mainline branch, not separate branch builds.  \n- Continuous Delivery ensures every commit is deployable to production, reducing deployment friction.  \n- Ring-based deployments allow teams to manage risk while iterating quickly.  \n- CI/CD isn’t one-size-fits-all—tailoring it to your product and goals is key.  \n\nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we specialize in helping organizations design and implement CI/CD pipelines that fit their needs. Whether it’s full automation, ring-based deployments, or just a reliable build system, we can help you optimize your processes and deliver better software, faster.
