1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,280
what are the bariers that prevent

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,639
Developers

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,219
from fully accepting a product owner as

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,320
the final decision maker wow there's a

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,020
lot of barriers to that I see that all

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
all the time at the moment

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,100
um

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,920
other other people not respecting other

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,660
people who are perhaps more senior not

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,019
respecting the product owner is probably

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,500
the biggest barrier right it's it's

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,899
other people coming down and saying

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,360
something different to the team from the

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,600
product owner or

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,120
um going behind the product owner's back

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,480
or agreeing with the product owner in in

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,399
in person but then get it in a larger

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,440
environment with more people and perhaps

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,840
recording is on

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,000
um than disagreeing with them and seeing

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,920
it different uh I didn't experience

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,320
recently where

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,159
um a product owner the product owner was

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,020
really really frustrated uh because

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,140
they'd

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,020
um been collaborating with somebody in

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,119
the organization to to to to to get the

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,040
backlog all like this is what we need

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,299
this is what we're doing and they've

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159
been collaborating them with them quite

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,540
heavily they've had lots of private

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,759
meetings with them where they

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,040
collaborated and literally written the

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,080
backlog items word for word like that

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,720
key stakeholder that's the way they

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,939
wanted it and collaborated heavily on

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,159
that and then

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,340
um they get into

39
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,799
the the the the the the Sprint planning

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,220
and the stakeholders like no that's not

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,220
what I want

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,619
and it's like

43
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,619
that that is explicitly there's a couple

44
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,600
of things there right apart from being a

45
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,299
bit douchey right that's that's there's

46
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,420
that that's one piece but because it's

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,000
then in that group team Forum it

48
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,619
undermines

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,600
the ownership of the product by the

50
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,399
product owner right that totally

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
undermines it

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,540
and if the developers the people doing

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,160
the work

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,099
see that the product owner is being

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,720
undermined well I can't really listen to

56
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:22,560
the product owner I still have to run it

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,560
by Bob or I still need to speak to Janet

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,660
or whoever it is that that is doing the

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,420
undermining and as more and more of

60
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,959
those things happen

61
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,140
the less unless the developers are able

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,580
to to feel that they are able to respect

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,020
product owner as the final decision

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,780
maker right

65
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,940
and if you look at the scrum guide

66
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,060
who needs to respect the product order

67
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,459
as the final decision maker everybody in

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,140
the organization everybody not not just

69
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,040
the people below them

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,800
but also all of the people about them

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,420
if if you're above a product owner and

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,519
the product owner is consistently not

73
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,500
making the right decisions

74
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,760
get rid of that product owner and get a

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,099
new one that's your call right you've

76
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,720
hired somebody to do a job if you don't

77
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,819
think they're doing a good job you don't

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,980
undermine them

79
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:21,900
you get rid of them

80
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,760
right and that maintains that respect of

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,379
product management that respect of

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,659
product ownership

83
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,580
right that the team sees that the person

84
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,280
that's appointed is respected by

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,800
management even if management might not

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,280
necessarily 100 agree with all of the

87
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,060
the the the the decisions that are made

88
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,500
but if most of the decisions are made

89
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,760
result in value delivered to the

90
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,400
business because that is the true

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,860
outcome right what what you what you

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,560
find yeah I I I'm gonna add an

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,379
additional bit because what you find is

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,319
that that disrespect

95
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:00,720
or undermining of authority of the

96
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,780
product owner comes from a position of

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,360
of maybe one key stakeholder not one

98
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,700
thing to to

99
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,319
give all the information not wanting to

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,239
take accountability for their decision

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
right

102
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,680
um and it

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,400
it just results in nobody

104
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,780
having any capability

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,520
leadership doesn't take the

106
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,840
accountability the product owner can't

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,300
take the accountability because they're

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,100
continuously undermined or the ideas are

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,280
changed without their knowledge or

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,100
understanding and the developers

111
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,780
there's no credibility in that story so

112
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,320
then if I were to come back to the

113
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,479
question and answer it in one word uh

114
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,060
what are the barriers there's only one

115
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,740
what is the barrier that prevents

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
developers from fully accepting a

117
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,540
product owner at the final decision

118
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,060
maker and it's accountability or in

119
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,220
three words a lot
