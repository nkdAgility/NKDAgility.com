# What are the barriers that prevent developers from fully accepting a product owner as the final word

*Understanding Barriers in Product Ownership*
Developers often face challenges in accepting a product owner as the final decision maker. This video dives deep into the reasons behind this. *Enjoy this video? Like and subscribe to our channel:* https://www.youtube.com/@nakedAgility

In this video, Martin üéôÔ∏è discusses the barriers that prevent developers from fully accepting a product owner's decisions. He highlights the importance of respect and accountability within the organization. When a product owner is undermined, it affects the team's trust and the overall effectiveness of the product management process. Martin emphasizes that everyone in the organization, from top to bottom, needs to respect the product owner's role and decisions. If there's a lack of alignment or undermining, it's essential to address the root cause rather than bypassing the product owner's authority. üöÄ
