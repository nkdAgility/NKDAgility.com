1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
most

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,759
organizations really

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,719
struggle

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,679
to enable the people that are doing the

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
work in their organization to understand

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,720
where they're going and what they're

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,680
trying to

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,960
achieve um I I remember working with a

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,199
with an organization in the US this is

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,720
just an example probably about 80% of

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,080
the no must be more like 90% this is

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,079
anecdotal evidence from me Consulting

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,600
with organizations um probably 90% plus

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,160
of organizations teams groups that I

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,960
work with um have no idea what value

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,000
means to their business um they have no

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,520
idea what the Strategic direction of

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,160
their organization is and they have no

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:58,519
idea what the current goal is for their

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
organization can you imagine that you're

21
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:01,879
trying to trying to do work trying to

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
decide what to build trying to decide

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,400
what direction to go and you've no idea

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,759
what that direction is that's like being

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,280
being uh dropped in a field in the

26
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,799
middle of nowhere and told to get to the

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,439
nearest Village and you have no idea

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,600
what direction that Village is you're

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,759
just going to have to come up with a

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,759
search pattern and you're going to have

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,119
to go try and search whereas what you

32
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:30,000
really need is a map and a compass and

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:35,560
that's what those things are right that

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,159
is what this idea of uh uh um

35
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,200
vision and value is for an

36
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,079
organization it's the map and the

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,920
compass where are we going how are we

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,320
going to get there are we going in the

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,600
right direction how do we measure how

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,680
we're going in the right direction

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,159
that's that's why I talk about

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,439
evidence-based management right how do

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,200
we measure we're being more successful

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,840
than before we made that decision um

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,039
that's why I talk about hypothesis

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,360
driven engineering practices um how do

47
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,720
we ensure that the ideas that we have

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,360
actually have a valid story to them

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
right are we making the difference that

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,160
we thought we were going to make with

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,800
the investment we thought we were going

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,680
to do um

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,760
and that's why it's so important for

54
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,879
Senior Management and leaders to grow

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,200
their product management and product

56
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,120
ownership capabilities in in their

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,680
organization to to to

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,640
understand how important that story is

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,519
for organizations to to to have not not

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,959
just to have h a a goal and a vision

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,200
right but for it to be articulated in a

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,760
way that every single person in your

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,000
organization understands what that goal

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,319
and what that vision is and how the work

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,920
they do every day contributes to it

66
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,440
because if the work they do every day

67
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,879
doesn't contribute to what it is your

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,519
business is trying to achieve then you

69
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,959
probably shouldn't be

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,120
doing right and if we don't know what

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,959
direction we're going how do we know

72
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,120
where even the big things that we're

73
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,680
working on are supporting that goal and

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
vision that we're trying to

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,959
achieve you need to have a North star

76
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,319
you need to understand as a business

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,519
what are you trying to achieve and be

78
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,599
able to communicate that to everybody in

79
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,879
your organization in a way that makes

80
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,000
sense to them it doesn't matter if it

81
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,480
makes sense to you right it has to make

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
sense to them because they're the ones

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,360
who are doing the work they're the ones

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,280
who are doing making the decisions every

85
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,599
person in your organization is making

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,439
lots of little micro decisions every day

87
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,519
within the context of um the context of

88
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,480
whatever it is they've been hired to do

89
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,319
right so software engineer

90
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,000
are making engineering decisions uh

91
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,400
Architects are making architectural

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,319
decisions uh project managers are making

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,040
project decisions

94
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,040
uh delivery managers are making delivery

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,880
decisions uh every single day they're

96
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,880
not going to go ask

97
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,040
you whether they're making the right

98
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,240
decision or not in order for

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,960
them to be able to understand what it is

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,520
that whether their decision is a good

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,160
decision or not right let's say they

102
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,840
just have two options you never have two

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,880
options you have like 50 options but

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,039
let's say you've got two options um and

105
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,600
depending on the

106
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,400
future one is right and one is

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,479
wrong maybe they're both right but one

108
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,880
could be right one could be wrong we

109
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,800
don't know yet depends on the future but

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,080
if I am making that decision and I

111
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:59,199
understand more about the context I

112
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,400
understand more about the impact that

113
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,880
this choice is going to make on the

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,160
future I can perhaps make a better

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,720
choice if I don't understand I'm just

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
going to randomly pick whichever one's

117
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,880
my

118
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,759
favorite right because that's what

119
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,400
people do what do I think based on the

120
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
limited knowledge I have is the best

121
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,759
thing I can do so if you look if you

122
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
look at something like um David

123
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,199
marquette's turn the ship around right

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,199
it talks about intent based

125
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,720
leadership what do you intend as a

126
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,440
business how do you communicate that

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
does everybody understand your intent

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,319
because if they don't understand your

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
intent they're going to make bad

130
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,199
decisions you want them to make good

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,919
decisions because they're going to make

132
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,440
the decisions because in order for you

133
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,520
to make the decisions you have to

134
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
understand everything that they

135
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,240
understand and you're hiring incredibly

136
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:57,639
technical people these days right in the

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:06:00,520
in the in the old days of um big textile

138
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,120
factories um

139
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,199
management

140
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,039
leadership management could make better

141
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,120
decisions than the people on the shop

142
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,479
floor because the people on the shop

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
floor were large a largely uneducated

144
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,120
Workforce and you could maybe talk you

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,160
even the four four people foremans were

146
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,360
um probably not highly educated they had

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,120
anecdotal knowledge right they didn't

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
understand the theory they just

149
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,240
understood the mechanisms of what's

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,120
happening on the on the floor um you

151
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,479
needed to go up to management levels to

152
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,759
get people to understand what it is

153
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,800
we're actually trying to achieve as the

154
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,319
business what's the thing so so they

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,440
didn't make any of the decisions at the

156
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,680
bottom but they weren't doing highly

157
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,039
technical work that required lots of

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,639
decisions when you're doing Simple

159
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,560
Things when you're doing let's say

160
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,440
you're when you're doing complicated

161
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,440
things you can document them into

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,160
simpleness right that's probably a good

163
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,080
way it's terrible way to describe it but

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,039
anyway you you can you can take a

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,800
complicated thing you you can write a

166
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,440
bunch of documentation create a bunch of

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,800
rules create a bunch of uh if this

168
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,919
happens then this happens and you can

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,199
provide standard operating procedures

170
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,319
right so you can you can provide those

171
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,039
uh for people and they can just follow

172
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,360
them and we're going to have good

173
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,199
outcomes right because by following that

174
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,680
standard operating procedure we're going

175
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,680
to have the same outcomes every time um

176
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,000
but in the world of

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:35,080
complexity when uh we are dealing with

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
surprise and um surprises and surprises

179
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:42,599
can be good or bad surprises and

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,759
opportunities right um those vary too

181
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,280
much and we can't create a standard

182
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,000
operating procedure because we will

183
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
perhaps not be able to maximize the

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
value that we create because we're just

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,159
following the standard operating

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,840
procedure and lots of big organizations

187
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,520
definitely fall into that trap of they

188
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,960
have a a sop for everything this is how

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,199
we do things here this is our

190
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,080
bureaucracy our red tape or uh whatever

191
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,319
you call it locally um and it inhibits

192
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,639
the ability of the people in your

193
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,360
organization to make better decisions

194
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,319
than the person who decided on the

195
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
standard operating procedure which may

196
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,479
have been 10 years ago in a different

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,919
Market in a different part of the

198
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,759
business for a different context and now

199
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,960
it's applied to everybody and everything

200
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,080
equally across the organization and in

201
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,000
some cases it's a good decision in other

202
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,719
cases is a really bad decision we want

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,599
to make more right decisions and less

204
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,159
wrong decisions and that means everybody

205
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:40,120
in your organization has to understand

206
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,240
what it is you're trying to achieve and

207
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,880
in order for them to do that you as the

208
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,320
business you as leaders and management

209
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,360
within that business need to grow your

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:58,120
understanding of

211
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,440
um how you communicate and engage with

212
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,120
everybody in your organization to ensure

213
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,320
that they understand what you're trying

214
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,000
to achieve in what direction they're

215
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,560
going and that means you can't just go

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,839
install okrs and have everything be

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,320
perfect you can't just write something

218
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,200
in your vision statement and have

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,320
everybody just follow it they need to

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,800
understand understanding is not a

221
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,240
Boolean proposition it's not something

222
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,880
that you can standard operating

223
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,360
bureaucrat your way into it needs to be

224
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,079
something that is personal that is based

225
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,240
on empathy that is based on engagement

226
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,480
with people and for that that's why we

227
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,680
have a product owner that's why we have

228
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,279
product ownership capabilities and in

229
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
order to maximize the value that your

230
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,160
organization creates you're going to

231
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,839
have to help everybody understand what

232
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,839
it is you're trying to achieve
