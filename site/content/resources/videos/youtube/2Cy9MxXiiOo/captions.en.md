So the question is, what is a Sprint goal? 

Where a vision is strategic, a product goal is intermediate strategic. The Sprint goal is really tactical. It's what are we doing just now to make progress towards our product goal, towards our product vision. 

It has to be really something that the stakeholders can take at the Sprint review and provide you with actual feedback. We like this because, or we hate this because of this other thing. It's a tactical goal that your team is working on right now.
