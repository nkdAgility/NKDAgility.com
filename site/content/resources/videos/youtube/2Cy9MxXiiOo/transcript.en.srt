1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,000
so the question is what is a Sprint goal

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:12,179
um where a vision is strategic a product

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,199
goal is intermediate strategic the

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:19,760
Sprint goal is really tactical it's what

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,800
are we doing just now to make progress

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,340
towards our product goal towards our

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,260
product vision and it has to be

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:34,500
really something that the stakeholders

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:38,040
can take at the Sprint review and

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,800
provide you with actual feedback we like

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
this because or we hate this because of

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,899
this other thing it's a tactical goal

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,899
that your team is working on right now
