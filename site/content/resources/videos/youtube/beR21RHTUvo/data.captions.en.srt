1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,220
There are a number of ghosts of Agile
past that plague us and the first one

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,350
that I want to talk about is story points.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,840
The person that
originally created the idea

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,800
of story points has publicly
apologized for creating them.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,410
That should tell you something
about story points.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,620
But ultimately,

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,690
story points have been
with us for a very long time.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,720
In the old, old, old days,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,660
people used to do a lot
of absolute estimation.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,290
So things like hours, right?
We used to figure out exactly

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,160
how many hours this thing would take.
This will take 5,000 hours.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,120
And then we would
perhaps measure ourselves

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,340
against how many hours it did take.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,340
And in order to kind of move away

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,840
from that idea of hours
and absolute estimation,

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,470
a lot of teams started talking
about relative estimation

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,150
and relative estimation
points in some way.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,770
And that could be t-shirt
sizes I often hear,

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,590
but the main one is story points.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,860
Story points have been
with us probably for about,

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,580
about 20 years.

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,660
They've been plaguing,
they've been haunting teams

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,500
for about 20 years.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,740
And story points create a
whole bunch of, wow,

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,020
Really difficult things with teams.
So one of them is that you'll often see

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,430
or hear teams having a conversation

27
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,440
about how they claim points
for the work that they've done so

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,120
that they can push the rest
of the work that they haven't done

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,460
into the next sprint.

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,900
That's pretty dysfunctional
behavior right?

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,280
The point is not the points,
the point is the value

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,890
that we're delivering and
that's what we should be focusing on,

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,980
not some arbitrary set of points.

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:08,440
We also see teams being measured
or compared across teams based on

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
their story points.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,040
This team delivers 30
story points per sprint,

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,440
this team delivers 20
story points per sprint,

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,630
so this team must be better
than this team and that is utter garbage.

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,330
There is no way to compare
story points across teams.

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,570
There is no way, there is no
normalization algorithm

41
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,420
that you can use to do that comparison
or create it in some way.

42
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,980
It's just one of those
agile bullshit things

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,960
that keeps sticking
around we can't get rid of.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,320
So the the what was the
other thing that story...

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
Story...
Oh!

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,040
I recently engaged with a customer

47
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,140
and they had a team
that was struggling to deliver.

48
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,990
It was actually five
teams working on one product

49
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,720
and they were struggling to deliver.

50
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,940
And I was trying to figure
out what the problem was

51
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,040
and they kept going on
about story points were

52
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,420
the most important thing
for them to progress

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,860
and they had to get a
specific number of story points

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,820
And this was a professional
services organization.

55
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,160
And I found out that the contract
that they had with the customer,

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,640
obviously,

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,160
Somebody

58
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,930
on the customer's side
and somebody on their side had decided

59
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,400
that it would be a great idea,

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,960
because they've heard
about these story point things,

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,800
to put story points into the contract

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,040
and they were contracted
for an exact number of story points and

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,000
if they were outwith a 15% deviation
from the exact number

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,100
of story points then there
were fiscal penalties

65
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,890
for the for the
professional services organization

66
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,360
so you can imagine the raft
of dysfunctional behaviors that resulted

67
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,100
from that.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,200
I used to think story
points were a good thing.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,320
I used to think they were a good thing.

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,460
And now I'm a little bit more aligned

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,050
with Daniel Vacanti on this.

72
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,280
He's the Kanban, pro Kanban guy.

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Story points have set
our industry back 20 years.

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,880
Story points are one of the things

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,570
that have restricted the ability
for us to adapt to changing circumstances

76
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,290
as we might have because there's
that continuous focus on the numbers,

77
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:00,840
continuous focus on the work that's done
because story points reflect the work,

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,540
not the value, right?

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,160
Continuous focus on the work, the butts
on the seats, rather than on the value

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,940
that's created.

81
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,340
So I'm a firm believer
in flow metrics moving towards,

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,960
They're not the be all and end all,
right? Because we can have awesome flow

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,260
and we're delivering tons
of crap into production, but

84
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,680
at least flow is telling
us what's really going on,

85
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
right? We're
looking at our cycle time,

86
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,220
we're looking at our work item aging,
we're looking at our throughput,

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,880
right?

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,500
Those metrics are just based
on historical fact

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,920
for what we're delivering.

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,640
We can certainly manipulate them
by reducing batch size,

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,280
which usually has good outcomes.

92
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,170
And I just find that they're
all round a more useful way of looking

93
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,500
at the data of, and potentially looking
across multiple teams as well

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,810
for a whole department,
for a whole organization.

95
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,780
What is it we're able to deliver,
what does that look like?

96
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,740
But ultimately,

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,960
moving towards more flow-based metrics
and away from relative size estimation,

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,190
I think is a good idea.

99
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,370
And That's why I put story points

100
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,250
in that list of ghosts of Agile past.

101
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,790
And if you are being haunted
by these ghosts of Agile past,

102
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,280
We can help you exercise them
or help you find a coach,

103
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,060
consultant or trainer who can.

104
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't let these phantoms undermine
the effectiveness of the value

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,910
that you deliver.

106
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,600
And the longer you wait,
the more they're going to haunt

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,130
your team's progress.

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,560
