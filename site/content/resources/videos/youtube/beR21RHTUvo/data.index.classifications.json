The intent is to inform Agile practitioners and teams, which is somewhat adjacent to the SLE audience, but the signal-to-noise ratio is low due to a predominant focus on story points and only general references to flow measurement.

The main thrust is aligning agile measurement away from gamed internal numbers toward outcomes that matter—commonly interpreted as customer value—but the terms 'customer needs' or 'customer outcomes' are not directly and repeatedly referenced. The depth of analysis regarding team incentives, metric selection, and value is strong, but it would be even closer to the category if it included concrete methods for establishing measurable customer outcomes and feedback loops.
