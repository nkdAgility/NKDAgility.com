When it comes to migrating to the cloud, one of the most significant challenges we face is ensuring that our existing systems and customisations will function seamlessly in the new environment. I’ve been through this process multiple times, and I can tell you that preparation is key. 

Recently, I discovered a fantastic tool provided by Microsoft that can help streamline this process. This tool runs against your database and identifies potential issues before they become problems. It’s like having a roadmap that highlights the bumps in the road ahead, allowing you to address them proactively. Here’s how I approach this:

### Key Steps for a Successful Migration

1. **Utilise Microsoft’s Tool**: 
   - This tool will provide you with a comprehensive report detailing what’s likely to go wrong during the migration. 
   - It highlights areas that need attention, which can save you a lot of headaches down the line.

2. **Review Customisations**:
   - Not all customisations will work in the cloud. 
   - Some custom fields and backend setups may not be compatible due to the lack of access to the backend in a cloud environment. 

3. **Plan for Rewrites**:
   - If you identify customisations that won’t work, don’t panic. 
   - The good news is that these can often be rewritten before the migration takes place. This proactive approach can save time and resources later.

4. **Work Through the Stories**:
   - As you identify issues, create a list of stories or tasks that need to be addressed. 
   - This will help you keep track of what needs to be done and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### Personal Experience

In my own experience, I’ve seen teams struggle with the migration process simply because they didn’t take the time to assess their current setup thoroughly. By leveraging tools like the one from Microsoft and being diligent about reviewing customisations, you can significantly reduce the risk of encountering major issues post-migration.

### Final Thoughts

Migrating to the cloud doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right tools and a solid plan in place, you can navigate the complexities of the process with confidence. Remember, the key is to be proactive rather than reactive. By addressing potential issues before they arise, you’ll set your team up for success in the cloud.

If you’re considering a migration, I highly recommend taking advantage of Microsoft’s tool and dedicating time to review your customisations. It’s an investment that will pay off in the long run, ensuring a smoother transition and a more robust system in the cloud.
