00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,480
Microsoft actually provide a tool that

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:08,360
you run against your database that will

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,480
H tell you almost all of the things that

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,040
are going to be wrong and how to fix

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,519
them so it's a case of just working

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,119
through all of those stories um so

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,320
there's some customizations that aren't

8
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,400
going to work um in the cloud there's

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,560
there's quite a few um uh custom field

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,279
setups or backend customizations that

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,519
are not going to be able to work because

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,199
you have no access to the back end those

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,200
would need to be Rewritten but luckily

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,200
they can be Rewritten prior to the

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
migration
