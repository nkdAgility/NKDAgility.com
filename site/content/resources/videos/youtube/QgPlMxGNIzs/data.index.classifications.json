    "reasoning": "Direct mention of 'Agentic Engineering' doesn't occur; the content instead details the evolution of Agile with a strong focus on decentralised decision-making, team autonomy, and feedback-driven adaptability—topics conceptually close to agentic engineering. Examples include criticizing imposed frameworks and advocating for empowered teams. There is depth in its exploration of shifting from command-and-control to responsive, adaptive work environments. However, the discussion never names agentic engineering directly, nor does it address systemic observability, DevOps-infused craft, or AI/human collaboration explicitly—missing core category hallmarks. The audience (agile practitioners, leaders) is generally appropriate, intent is aligned, and the majority of the discussion is relevant, although some content is company promotion.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content aligns well with Agentic Engineering through its focus on decentralised decision-making, team empowerment, and adaptability in Agile, but lacks direct mention of the term and omits key topics such as AI agency and systemic observability. Overall, it is conceptually relevant and suitably targeted but not a perfect fit.",

However, it does not mention agentic software delivery, AI agents, contextual intelligence, or related topics. There is no substantive discussion of integrating autonomous agents or human–AI collaboration. The audience (agile practitioners, consultants) very lightly overlaps but is only tangentially related. The content's intent, alignment, and signal-to-noise all remain on agile evolution and leadership dynamics, not agentic delivery.",
