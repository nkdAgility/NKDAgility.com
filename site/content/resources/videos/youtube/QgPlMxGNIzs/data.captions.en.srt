1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,340
foreign

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:15,059
how do I think agile is involving since

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,940
its Inception in 2001.

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,699
I I think it's been involving steadily

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,039
although often unfortunately not in the

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,939
way we would like

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,939
um I think

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,180
the one of the whole purposes of agile

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,700
and the agile Manifesto and the ideas

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,800
behind it forget the names of the things

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,460
right the ideas behind it

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,860
is that we're trying to move away from

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,579
um those top down

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,680
steering departmental organizations

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:52,620
towards something that's

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,379
um more uh decentralized and

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,719
democratized right so that we can

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,820
respond better to to what's happening in

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,840
the market and that's just not been

20
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,420
happening most organizations even those

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,820
that that say that they're they're doing

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,700
agile they even I would look at and say

23
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,619
yeah they're doing pretty well right are

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,780
actually still

25
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,979
um hierarchical steering and budget

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,580
comes from the top type of organizations

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,420
um

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:28,460
it it people aren't making that that

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:32,759
leap which I think it is a leap from

30
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,860
steering towards decentralization

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,840
and I think that's the evolution that's

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,579
happening now you're seeing a lot of

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,079
movements uh now talking about agile 2.0

34
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,780
talking about

35
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,479
um rewilding of agile

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,060
right um and those those ideas are

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,140
around let's let's kind of get back to

38
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,860
the original ideas which is getting rid

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,979
of these monolithic processes that are

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,600
perhaps getting in the way of of of the

41
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,399
standardized processes which are getting

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
in the way of our ability to deliver

43
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,319
value to our customers and engage with

44
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,300
our Market in a way that is dynamic and

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,459
fast right

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,560
um and that that that I think is is

47
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,480
the new struggle is how do we get back

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,480
to those topics and I think one of the

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,599
things that I've been trying to do is

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,620
use less agile terminology

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,640
right because most people I think are

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,980
um Fed Up of hearing agile this ideal

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,599
that mindset this mindset that and they

54
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,220
think it's just all a big pile of

55
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
bollocks now because it's not worked for

56
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,300
them

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,040
but the reality is that it it it they

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,560
haven't been doing it which is part of

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,300
what's not working for them right it

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,420
causes more friction to try and create

61
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,040
decentralization and democratization

62
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,080
within the bounds of an organization

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
that is inherently commanding control

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,200
you're just going to cause lots of

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,660
friction and then things aren't going to

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,840
happen in command and control wins

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,819
so I think that yeah I think that's the

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
big the big change

69
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,140
um or the big

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,700
push that we're looking at now and how

71
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,440
agile has changed it's gone through that

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
phase of

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,800
um not

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,680
actually providing a lot of value or

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,319
nibbling at the edges of providing value

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,560
for organizations and now we're starting

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,620
to see more organizations move to

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,760
embracing more of the underlying

79
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,500
concepts of of empiricism

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,159
self-organization decentralization and

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,159
democratization
