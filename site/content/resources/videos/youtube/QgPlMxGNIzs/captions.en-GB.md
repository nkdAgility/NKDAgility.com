How do you think Agile is evolving since its inception in 2001? 

I think it's been evolving steadily, although often unfortunately not in the way we would like. 

I think that one of the whole purposes of Agile and the Agile Manifesto and the ideas behind it, forget the names of the things, right? The ideas behind it, is that we're trying to move away from those top-down steering departmental organizations towards something that's more decentralized and democratized, right? So that we can respond better to what's happening in the market. And that's just not been happening. 

Most organizations, even those that say that they're doing agile, that even I would look at and say, yeah, they're doing pretty well, right? Are actually still hierarchical steering and budget comes from the top type of organizations. 

People aren't making that leap, which I think it is a leap from steering towards decentralization. And I think that's the evolution that's happening now. You're seeing a lot of movements now talking about Agile 2.0, talking about rewilding of Agile, right? And those ideas are around, let's kind of get back to the original ideas which is getting rid of these monolithic processes that are perhaps getting in the way of the standardized processes which are getting in the way of our ability to deliver value to our customers and engage with our market in a way that is dynamic and fast, right? 

And that I think is the new struggle is how do we get back to those topics. And I think one of the things that I've been trying to do is use less agile terminology, right? Because most people I think are fed up of hearing agile this, agile that, mindset this, mindset that, and they think it's just all a big pile of bollocks now because it's not worked for them. 

But the reality is that they haven't been doing it, which is part of what's not working for them, right? It causes more friction to try and create decentralization and democratization within the bounds of an organization that is inherently command and control. You're just going to cause lots of friction and then things aren't going to happen and command and control wins. 

So I think that, yeah, I think that's the big change or the big push that we're looking at now and how Agile has changed, it's gone through that phase of not actually providing a lot of value or nibbling at the edges of providing value for organizations and now we're starting to see more organizations move to embracing more of the underlying concepts of empiricism, self-organization, decentralization and democratization.
