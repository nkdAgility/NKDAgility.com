1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,660
How do you think Agile is evolving

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,220
since its inception in 2001?

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,360
I think it's been evolving steadily,
although often unfortunately not

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,700
in the way we would like.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,960
I think...

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,440
That one of the whole purposes

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,300
of Agile and the Agile Manifesto
and the ideas behind it,

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,120
forget the names of the things,
right? The ideas behind it, is

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,730
that we're trying to move away
from those top-down steering

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,060
departmental organizations
towards something

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:54,350
that's more decentralized
and democratized, right?

12
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,510
So that we can respond better
to what's happening in the market.

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,690
And that's just not been happening.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,900
Most organizations,

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
even those that say
that they're doing agile,

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,220
that even I would look
at and say, yeah,

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,270
they're doing pretty well, right?

18
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,540
Are actually still hierarchical steering
and budget comes from the top type

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,220
of organizations.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,920
People aren't making that leap,
which I think it is a leap

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,440
from steering

22
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,280
towards decentralization.

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,890
And I think that's the
evolution that's happening now.

24
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,340
You're seeing a lot of movements
now talking about Agile 2.0,

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
talking about rewilding

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,610
of Agile,

27
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,610
right?

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,200
And those ideas are around, let's kind
of get back to the original ideas

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,250
which is getting rid
of these monolithic processes

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,040
that are perhaps getting
in the way of the standardized processes

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,980
which are getting in the way of
our ability to deliver value to

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,860
our customers and engage with our market
in a way that is dynamic and fast,

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,400
right?

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
And

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,160
that I think is the new struggle
is how do we get back to those topics.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
And I think one of the things
that I've been trying

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,300
to do is use less agile terminology,

38
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,720
right? Because most
people I think are fed up

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,500
of hearing agile this,
agile that, mindset this, mindset that,

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,000
and they think it's just all a big pile
of bollocks now because it's not worked

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
for them.

42
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,200
But the reality is
that they haven't been doing it,

43
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,240
which is part of what's
not working for them, right?

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,900
It causes more friction to try
and create decentralization

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,660
and democratization

46
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,350
within the bounds of an organization
that is inherently command and control.

47
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,220
You're just going to
cause lots of friction

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,840
and then things aren't going to happen
and command and control wins.

49
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,940
So I think that, yeah,
I think that's the big change

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,880
or the big push that we're looking
at now and how Agile has changed,

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,660
it's gone through that phase
of not actually providing a lot of value

52
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,560
or nibbling at the edges
of providing value for organizations

53
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,060
and now we're starting to
see more organizations move

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,500
to embracing more of the underlying
concepts of empiricism,

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,140
self-organization,

56
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,940
decentralization and democratization.
