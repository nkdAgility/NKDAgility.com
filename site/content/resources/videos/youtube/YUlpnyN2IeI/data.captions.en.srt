1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,380
the question is what's the best scrum

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,300
advice I've ever received

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,820
and

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,820
I think we it's the same advice we

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,980
actually see all the time although on on

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,980
social media although in varying degrees

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,660
of upsettedness with scrum and

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,920
Frameworks and stuff

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,160
and you'll see there's a lot of

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,740
movements out there to move away from

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,320
a Dogma that I feel like didn't really

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,380
exist except in

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,500
crappy people anyway right this this

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,300
Dogma that oh you're not you're not

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,379
doing scrum unless you're standing up or

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
you're not doing scrum unless you're

17
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,480
doing user stories or

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
um if you don't do exactly 15 minutes

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,500
for your daily scrum and it must be in

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,520
person then you're not doing scrum all

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,860
of that stuff I think has always been

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,719
[Â __Â ] it's not really it's not really

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:03,359
scrum it's not really agile it's not

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
really in keeping with that story and

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,340
people kind of latch on to that idea of

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
uh in the footnotes of scrum of the

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,640
scrum guide it does say that scrum as

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,439
defined in here is immutable and

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,780
implementing part of it is fine right

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,640
but

31
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,439
um it's not scrum if you only Implement

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,200
part of it and

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,640
people latch onto that so I think the

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,740
main advice is not to be dogmatic to be

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,380
pragmatic

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,439
and I feel like you could you you need

37
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,360
to be dogmatic in education right

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,880
because you're telling somebody how

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,420
something works right this thing is

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,159
defined this way here is how it works

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,840
does it matter that they use it

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,119
differently when they actually go and

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,100
use it in their company no are they

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,259
getting valued yes then we're cool right

45
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,079
are they doing all of it no are they

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,840
still getting value yes then it's great

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,340
um you don't need to be following every

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,380
little thing

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,360
um to to me that's successful and it's

50
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,520
actually something something that I

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,800
think the scrum guide scroll struggles

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,080
with because people complain when it

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,860
tells you it's to

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,060
structured into uh detailed and then

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,680
they complain when it doesn't tell you

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,060
how to solve your problems right oh the

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,640
scrum guide's not enough of course it's

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,020
not enough nothing's enough

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,860
um you need to come up with the

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,599
strategies and that I think is that that

61
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,940
core piece of advice that I see

62
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,099
consistent advice that I see from almost

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,800
everybody who knows what they're talking

64
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:44,040
about on the internet and whether it's

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,379
scrum agile lean cap doesn't matter what

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,580
it is the advice is almost always the

67
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,640
same

68
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,160
um the actual framework the actual tools

69
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,420
that you use are just tools they don't

70
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,819
matter

71
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,040
people and interactions over processes

72
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,040
and tools processes and tools are

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,319
valuable use them when they're effective

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,560
for you adapt them when they're not

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,060
ditch them when they're bad right that's

76
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,680
it that's that's the only advice you

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,900
need to be

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,659
um more agile

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,659
um but I would also caveat that I'm

80
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,659
going to caveat that because how do you

81
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:25,019
know something doesn't work for you if

82
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:29,220
you haven't done it right there's also

83
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,620
that idea that sometimes especially when

84
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,440
we're learning right and that could be

85
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,940
learning I'm in a classroom or learning

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,540
I'm trying to figure out how this thing

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,340
works is perhaps you want to do it the

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,000
way it says on the box

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,560
and then go I tried it this and this

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,599
stuff doesn't work we need to adapt this

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
we need to adapt that just like a recipe

92
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,799
and that's what I try and where the way

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,080
I try and phrase it

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,500
you know a recipe book

95
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,299
is not there for you to just follow

96
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,060
verbatim

97
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,340
because you will find that after you've

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,799
made the recipe verbatim once right you

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,439
follow the instructions you'll find it's

100
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,060
not quite to your taste maybe you like a

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,739
little bit more salt or you like a

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,199
little bit more paprika or you like to

103
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,620
put something else in it that is yours

104
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,239
so you take that recipe and you adapt it

105
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,940
and make it yours and create your own

106
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,759
recipe for what it is that you're doing

107
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,380
and that is the power of agile That's

108
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,479
The Power of

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,460
um flexibility of adaptive iterative

110
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,740
incremental and empirical processes

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,680
right use what works ditch what doesn't

112
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,660
look at the data see what's going on
