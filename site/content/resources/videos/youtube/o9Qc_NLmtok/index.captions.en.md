The immersive learning classes that we're teaching from Scrum.org are all over kind of seven to ten weeks. They have both learning, you know, classroom learning, offline learning, but also assignments at the end of each session for people to go and practice within their organisation. These new techniques, try them out, and then come back and get feedback, collaborate with a group of people who've all participated in the same assignment, and try and figure out what their next move is within their organisation. So the PSPO, for example, is ten at eight week of that iterative model.
