1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:09,160
when you're doing a migration of data um

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:12,120
for your devops um downtime isn't of

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,080
always great concern for organizations

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,560
if you've got 5,000 software engineers

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,840
in your collection um you don't want it

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,039
to be down for an extended period of

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
time and your your engineers not able to

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
not able to work I'm going to put that

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,240
in air quotes because it's not really

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
true not able to work uh for that period

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,399
of time so there's a couple of things

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,360
that you do need to kind of understand

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,719
in this this this context um even if TFS

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,640
slz devops is

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,239
down like offline your engineers can

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,160
still work it's just more difficult for

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,920
them to collaborate together uh so if

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,120
they're using git as the source control

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,359
system which is the primary source

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,920
control system in Azure devops and TFS

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:06,360
then um

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,080
they're able to even share code in a way

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,200
that works within the context of the

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
tool even when they're offline um that's

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,040
how Linux was created there was no

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
Central Source control system and they

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,119
sent patches to each other over email

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,960
right uh so get fully supports that

29
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,439
obviously they wouldn't have access to

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,520
the work items uh so they would need to

31
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,079
have you know know what it is we're

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,799
working on for the time that it's down

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:36,840
but um I will point out that if you plan

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,880
it right uh downtime can be absolutely

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,399
minimal uh the largest migration we have

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,520
done was uh uh 2.5 terabytes uh

37
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,960
collection that we moved up from on Prem

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,719
in Europe uh on Prem to asure devops and

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,640
we took the system offline because it

40
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,159
needs to be offline to do the final part

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,560
of the migration we're actually moving

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,039
up to the cloud uh we took it offline at

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:09,520
5:00 p.m. on Friday um and we were back

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,680
online uh Sunday morning uh the

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,200
engineers came in over the weekend to

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
validate uh that things looked good

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,239
right they did their cursory checks you

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,519
everything's in the right place that

49
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,200
that that's working this is working

50
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,000
that's kind of thing um and we they were

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,280
back up and running Monday morning so

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,599
that's probably one of there be very few

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,080
people out there that have collections

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,160
that big um but if you plan it right and

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,519
that took in order to do a 2.5 terabyte

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:45,239
uh um system in that time we probably

57
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:48,040
took 3 to six months of planning and dry

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,159
runs and validations and making sure

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,760
everything's good in the data um dry

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,800
runs are really important for that sorry

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,800
that's practice runs right um to get the

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
data out of the data center in a timely

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,680
manner get it up to the cloud in a

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,120
timely manner or get it processed cuz

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,080
that can be quite failure prone you want

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,560
to have done a dry run so that that

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,440
always you know that's going to work um

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
and perhaps have Microsoft on hand to

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,480
help out if if there are any issues um

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,080
so that that was minimal downtime I

71
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,799
think that was about 5 and a half

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,400
thousand software Engineers um and they

73
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,879
really really had no downtime 5:00 P p.m

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,120
on Friday uh back up uh uh uh in the

75
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,080
morning but they were a global company

76
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,040
so there was some downtime for some

77
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,599
engineers in some regions um right

78
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,439
because that's just unavoidable but we

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,439
minimized it as much as possible
