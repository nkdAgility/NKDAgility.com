That's ultimately where those practices came from. The Gantt chart was developed in 1905 for IR 1906. It's a long time ago, so project management has done a lot of work to make itself more modern, which has helped. But ultimately, project management, the tools and techniques in project management, are designed to help people that know everything that they're going to do plan the things that they're going to do.
