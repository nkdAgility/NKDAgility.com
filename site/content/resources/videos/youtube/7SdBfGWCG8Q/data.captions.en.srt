1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
another great thing that practitioners

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,120
get from immersive learning is

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,519
relationships relationships with the

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,240
other people in the class who are um

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,000
bringing their knowledge their

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,520
experience who effectively become your

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,560
colleagues over a period of time if you

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,960
just spend a few half days with them

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,519
over a week you're probably never going

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,559
to see or speak to them again but if you

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:34,280
spend 8 to 16 weeks with those folks

12
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:36,840
collaborating uh talking about how you

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,640
did things that's where relationships

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,640
are built
