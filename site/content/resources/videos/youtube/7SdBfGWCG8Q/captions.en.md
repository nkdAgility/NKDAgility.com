Another great thing that practitioners get from immersive learning is relationships. Relationships with the other people in the class who are bringing their knowledge, their experience, who effectively become your colleagues over a period of time. If you just spend a few half days with them over a week, you're probably never going to see or speak to them again. But if you spend 8 to 16 weeks with those folks, collaborating, talking about how you did things, that's where relationships are built.
