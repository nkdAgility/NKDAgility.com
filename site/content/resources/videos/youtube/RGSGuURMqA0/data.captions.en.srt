1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
you don't have to choose trends if

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,839
you've built agility into your core

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,760
because when your systems are adaptable

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,480
and your teams know how to respond to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,679
change you're not scrabbling to keep up

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,400
you're ready that's what DevOps and

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
agile are really about not velocity for

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,480
its own sake but reducing the friction

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,880
that holds you back when changes hit

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,519
want to adopt a new tool try a different

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,160
architecture rethink how you deliver

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,480
great but if your delivery pipeline's

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,200
fragile your teams are overloaded and

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,480
every change is a drama it doesn't

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,360
matter how shiny the tech is at Naked

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,399
Agility we help organizations build

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,239
resilience in the way they work we bring

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
DevOps and agile together not as

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,000
buzzwords but as enablers of sustainable

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,559
adaptability that means smoother paths

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
to production better feedback loops and

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,719
teams that can shift without stalling

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
it's not just about tools it's about

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,040
people practices and the systems that

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,720
connect them if you want to stop chasing

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,680
and start leading make adaptability part

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,680
of your foundation we'll help you get
