The content instead focuses on transparency, workflow optimisation, and process clarity via Caman as a complement to Scrum. While transparency is core to accountability-adjacent topics, the text's main themes—insight, visibility, value flow—are aligned more with process improvement than explicit outcome ownership or role-based accountability. There is little to no exploration of defined accountabilities (such as Product Owner or Scrum Master roles), structural constructs, or organizational design that impact accountability in modern work systems. Audience alignment is decent, as practitioners or process leads would find it relevant, but the intent is process-centric rather than accountability-centric, and the signal, while focused, is not category-central.",
