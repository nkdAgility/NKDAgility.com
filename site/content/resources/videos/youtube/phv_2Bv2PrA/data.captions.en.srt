1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,819
agile is fundamentally about shortening

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,880
the time it takes to deliver your

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,800
products to users and to learn from it

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
traditional management practices were

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,820
developed during the Industrial

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,779
Revolution to manage the work of largely

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,480
uneducated Workforce while we can still

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,359
be somewhat successful when using these

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,420
traditional management practices they no

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,240
longer fit the type of work that we are

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,759
doing in modern organizations

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,380
my name is Martin hincherwood I'm a

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,780
professional scrum trainer with

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,000
scrum.org professional kanban Trainor

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,700
with Pro kanban and I've been a

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Microsoft MVP in devops for the last 14

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,320
years

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,180
I want to create an understanding of the

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,460
two different worlds that we're talking

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,440
about here so during the Industrial

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,500
Revolution with a largely uneducated

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,320
Workforce we needed to make lots of

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,559
goods really quickly so we created a

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,260
model in our organizations where we had

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,180
the highly knowledgeable people at the

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,700
top of the organization who were

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,960
steering and giving direction to all of

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,299
the rest the people in the organization

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,700
that were largely uneducated

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,260
but the type of work that we were doing

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,299
the type of work we were physically

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,299
doing was was complicated

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,000
and this complicated work had a

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,759
particular characteristic right

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,759
um we could apply more knowledge

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,380
to it and it became

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,680
simple

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,259
right this work became simple so by

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,140
applying more knowledge to this problem

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,280
we made it simple so we created standard

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,520
operating procedures we uh um built out

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,860
common ways that things work and

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
optimized you know identified the

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,860
patterns and optimized for them uh we

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
pushed people into ability based groups

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,719
inside of our organization so we

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,440
actually we ended up not only with the

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,879
hierarchy of our organization but also

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,520
the departmental model within our

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,819
organization as well where we had the

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,920
CEO at the top giving direction they had

52
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,720
the absolute knowledge of the entire

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,599
business and how everything functioned

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,220
and they give direction

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:36,239
to perhaps the sales team or the uh

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,000
marketing team right and they had a head

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,040
who then farmed out that work to

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,300
individual people down the down the

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,000
totem

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,000
um and work work work was done and that

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,400
that works great in a world where the

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,040
CEO can give instructions give

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,200
instructions and we follow them and

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,920
things are successful but the problem is

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,879
the market is at the bottom

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,940
and in our new world and the market is

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,420
changing a lot more frequently than the

68
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,180
CEO is is is taking a a test on what's

69
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,840
going on so knowledge would have to flow

70
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,940
back up this chain and it's too slow if

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,580
your organization is unable to respond

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,159
to change as quickly as your competitors

73
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,860
you're going to fail and because the

74
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,140
markets have changed this complicated

75
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,140
work no longer really exists we can't

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,840
turn it into simple so every single

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,940
thing we do becomes custom which means

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,500
that that flow of information is

79
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,900
becoming heavier and heavier and heavier

80
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,940
up and down the chain in order to get

81
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,959
things done and it's just not being

82
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,640
successful

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,099
and that's because we're we're not

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,180
operating in this complicated space

85
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,739
anymore

86
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,480
things have changed things have become

87
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,000
complex

88
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,519
and no amount of

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,159
standard operating procedures or

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,799
processes or practices or ways of doing

91
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,220
things can turn

92
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,700
complicated work into simple

93
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,760
okay it never becomes simple what

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,979
complicated sorry complex work does do

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,199
is it generates

96
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,199
copious amounts of

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,880
surprise right that's those markets

98
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,240
changing so we need to be able to adapt

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,340
to it much more quickly uh than we were

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,560
doing before so that's that's the

101
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,560
different world so traditional

102
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,120
management and project management

103
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:47,120
practices were developed to work in this

104
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,160
space so you have things like uh PMI

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,340
uh uh prince2

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,080
um more more recently we have things

107
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,080
like

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,479
safe the scaled agile framework and are

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,300
all developed to work in this space

110
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,000
where the work is is is just merely

111
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,300
complicated and we can turn it simple by

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,940
documenting a process okay but in actual

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,560
fact we mostly most of the work we do

114
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,800
today most of the way our organizations

115
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,720
need to operate today is we operate in a

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,540
complex World complex markets complex

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
work delivering all this complex uh

118
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,820
creative things

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,979
and agile was a response to that

120
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,900
difference right

121
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,840
um agile's been around a very long time

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:39,180
the agile Manifesto was signed in 2001

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:43,620
which is 22 years ago 21 years ago

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,740
um scrum was developed in this space

125
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,720
and scrum has been around for 25 years

126
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:56,639
uh 2019 93 was the first rendition of

127
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:59,699
scrum but even before that way back in

128
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,620
the the new new product development game

129
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,919
uh article Harvard Business review

130
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:09,800
article I have a a definition at the end

131
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,120
um was 1986 I think 1986. so these ideas

132
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,539
have been around for an incredibly long

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,460
time and actually uh it started long

134
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,460
before that but that's that's too much

135
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,620
for for just now but if we exist in this

136
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,259
complex space we need processes and

137
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,380
practices that were developed for this

138
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,720
complex space and we need something a

139
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,660
little bit different

140
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,919
um because in our world of of uh

141
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,539
complexity

142
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,759
things are very unpredictable okay uh

143
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,160
there's a great lack of predictability

144
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,979
in those species uh so here I've

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,539
categorized the the types of things that

146
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,759
we would do in product development just

147
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,919
into three three key areas uh

148
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,139
requirements technology and people

149
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,819
um it's a very very broad categories I

150
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,139
do understand that

151
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,539
um but let's think about the

152
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,699
predictability of each of those items

153
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,580
and where it would sit

154
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,259
well we're no longer taking orders right

155
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,819
we're not having orders coming from

156
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,759
above in the organization and we just

157
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,520
follow it the customer

158
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,560
might say yes I want this uh but the

159
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,319
reality is that the chances of this

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,300
being what they actually need are are

161
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,819
are are very different in fact there's

162
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,580
some good data around that uh so the

163
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,139
Standish group in in Boston create the

164
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,340
chaos report

165
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,060
um and they've added a few things that

166
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,220
story one of them is that uh um

167
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,060
35

168
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:43,020
percent of our requirements

169
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:46,979
change over the life of our product not

170
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,120
only that but 65 percent of the things

171
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,120
that we build

172
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,800
are used little

173
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,979
if ever

174
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,300
think about the waste for every every

175
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:07,139
dollar of investment that we have we're

176
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,139
losing 65 65 cents on the dollar is

177
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,419
being lost just to building stuff that

178
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,699
our customers don't actually use so why

179
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,620
do we build things that our customers

180
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,900
don't actually use surely they asked for

181
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,639
them so they need them but the reality

182
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,080
is that they ask for things they don't

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,580
need and the reason they ask for things

184
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,340
they don't need is because we ask them

185
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,620
an unreasonable question we say what are

186
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,539
you going to need in a year's time in 12

187
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,240
months when we've built your product for

188
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:35,159
you what do you need and the reality is

189
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,479
they don't know they don't know what

190
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,940
business decisions are going to happen

191
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
over the next 12 months they don't know

192
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,320
what Market changes are going to happen

193
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,839
over the next 12 months they don't know

194
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,279
what other unpredictable world events

195
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,060
are going to happen over the next 12

196
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,820
months so their knowledge of what might

197
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,160
maybe happen includes a whole bunch of

198
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,680
things that they won't need once the

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,500
decisions been made or if a particular

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,420
event happens we need these hundred

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,459
features if it doesn't happen we need

202
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,959
these other 100 features and if we're

203
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,880
asking them up front they're going to

204
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,160
give us the full 200 features so there's

205
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,000
half of those things we don't need

206
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,279
so requirements while we like to think

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,680
that our requirements once we've signed

208
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,760
off on them are are fairly High

209
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:27,260
predictability the reality is is they're

210
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,779
probably closer to that 30 percent

211
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,339
predictable so we need to figure out

212
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,720
um how do we how do we adapt more

213
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,100
quickly to be able to take that into

214
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,820
account

215
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:42,180
uh the next thing is technology okay uh

216
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,459
technology could be our uh the the

217
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,980
software technology it could be a

218
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,580
product technology it could be

219
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,940
um

220
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,700
processes ways of doing things

221
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,560
technology right uh probably scrum sits

222
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,060
in that space kanban sits in that space

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,760
these are technologies that were

224
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,260
developed in order to help us do things

225
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,060
uh traditional project management

226
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,920
practices PMI and prints too are

227
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,700
Technologies right ways of doing things

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,040
but the reality is that even during the

229
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,220
life of a product the technologies that

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,279
we need are going to change okay so some

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,260
of those Technologies might be uh would

232
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,339
you would you run a product in exactly

233
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,500
the same way when you're building

234
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,080
something new versus you're supporting

235
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,880
something that exists versus something

236
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,920
happened in the market that you need to

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
adapt around making a change to what's

238
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,019
going on no we're going to use different

239
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,080
processes and practices and even in the

240
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,480
software technology

241
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,120
windows and visual studio are are are on

242
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,100
daily builds these products the products

243
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,500
that we rely on that we use as part of

244
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,899
our process are constantly constantly

245
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,420
changing now technology is probably a

246
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,920
little bit more uh predictable than

247
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,920
requirements

248
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,920
um I'll put this in the 50 there it

249
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,980
might be a little bit higher okay but

250
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,140
it's still fairly fairly low and then

251
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,420
our last our last predictability is

252
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,240
people right and I don't know about you

253
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,760
but I don't come into work every day and

254
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,640
operate at exactly the same level people

255
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,500
are not machines no matter how much we

256
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,300
want to say that people should just come

257
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,180
into work and be professional every day

258
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,300
that's not how human beings operate

259
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,279
people take vacation people take sick

260
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,740
days people have kids people have

261
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,300
arguments people have disagreements if I

262
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,700
have to work with somebody I don't like

263
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,579
I'm not going to perform as well as I

264
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,980
would uh uh if I was working with

265
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,480
somebody I did like right we're going to

266
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,300
collaborate more

267
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,120
what is that impact on on the world and

268
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,500
I would suggest that people are probably

269
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,700
the least predictable element here

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,339
um

271
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,560
and if you if you average this across

272
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,079
each of these different ideas these

273
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,700
different topics we get a we get a kind

274
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,920
of picture of very low predictability

275
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,200
definitely less than 50 percent now

276
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,640
imagine that you've created our project

277
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,920
plan uh for the next next 12 months

278
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,899
um we've created our bunch of mitigating

279
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,640
uh we've got we've got a bunch of risks

280
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,260
that might happen we've got maybe 200

281
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,579
risks that might happen over the life of

282
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,320
the product

283
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,360
um and we have a whole bunch of

284
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
mitigating actions that we've created if

285
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,680
this happens we'll do this

286
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,779
that

287
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,600
what if 40 uh sorry eight eight sixty

288
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,920
percent sixty percent of all of that is

289
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,339
going to change over the life of the

290
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,260
product and change constantly right what

291
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,000
is that impact on the body of work that

292
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,860
we've created and our look forward into

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,779
the future there's a lot of waste in

294
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,240
there uh things that we couldn't protect

295
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:52,560
those surprises are going to happen so

296
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,839
we really want to tackle it in a

297
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,620
different way

298
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:01,260
uh so in in this agile space we deal

299
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,420
with this predictability this lack of

300
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,060
predictability we deal with it by having

301
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:10,200
working product on a regular Cadence

302
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,899
okay so perhaps we have a regular

303
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,260
Cadence of once a month we're going to

304
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:22,680
deliver working usable product so

305
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:25,860
instead of just having that single uh

306
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:30,060
delivery at the end in our traditional

307
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,000
model we have continuous delivery of new

308
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,279
uh product working product that our

309
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,220
customer can use can work with in

310
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,200
production can give us feedback on that

311
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,180
will help inform the next piece of work

312
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,500
this gives us a whole bunch of

313
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,300
capabilities and I'm going to talk about

314
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,800
that in a moment but this is the

315
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,720
superpower

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,980
um this is the thing that allows us to

317
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,980
mitigate risk

318
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,540
is the only thing that allows us to

319
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,639
mitigate risk in this complex world

320
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,500
where everything's changing so much we

321
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,600
can't plan our way out of the risk like

322
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,760
we would in a traditional model when the

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,980
variance is very small when the variance

324
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,079
is high we need to create these working

325
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,500
usable products because then when

326
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:17,160
something happens let's say a market

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:21,779
change happens we can maybe do another

328
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:24,540
release very quickly after right we can

329
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:29,660
do more releases than we have here

330
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,660
perhaps uh there's a world event

331
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,519
happens and we need to do a bunch of

332
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,920
small releases in order to get these the

333
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,380
the the the the you know competitors

334
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,540
released uh new features and we need to

335
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,360
get it our features into Market very

336
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,420
quickly and these are

337
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,240
the tool that we use to mitigate risk so

338
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,600
let's look at what that looks like

339
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,959
so in um I'm gonna gonna go through this

340
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,100
first uh quickly with uh or with a

341
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,100
traditional mindset right

342
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,100
so in a traditional mindset let's say we

343
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:10,260
take that a pure traditional mindset

344
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,940
where we don't actually give the

345
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,380
customer uh we don't deploy to

346
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,180
production Until the End you've got 12

347
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:17,220
month project let's say it's going to

348
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,880
cost 12 million of whatever monies you

349
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,100
like dollars Euros or Pounds and we're

350
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,120
going to deliver on a monthly basis so

351
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,760
we're gonna have

352
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,680
um in a traditional model uh we're going

353
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,440
to deliver at the end of the 12 months

354
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,060
okay so what's the visibility during the

355
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,060
life of the product well visibility

356
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,800
normally starts high right it's going to

357
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,540
start high because we're writing the

358
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,600
documentation we're communicating what's

359
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,820
going on uh but then

360
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,260
right at the end we've got high

361
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,920
visibility because we've delivered them

362
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,560
working products but in between how much

363
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,959
visibility does the customer actually

364
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,180
have right what can they actually see

365
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,699
what can they use in the product what do

366
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,740
they really know apart from you know we

367
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,860
tell them things are going great right

368
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,680
we're 80 there and all of those things

369
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,980
so while visibility is not zero

370
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,079
it is fairly fairly low throughout the

371
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,820
life of the project and goes at low

372
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,240
fairly quickly

373
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:21,720
couple that because visibility is is not

374
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,100
higher ability to change also uh over

375
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,139
the life of the project drops fairly

376
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,180
quickly so our ability to change at the

377
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,459
end is very low right we've built a

378
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,740
bunch of stuff right so we have a low

379
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:34,680
ability to change it's more expensive to

380
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,139
change things but we drop very quickly

381
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,360
after we start work in a traditional

382
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,120
model because we start everything right

383
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,459
we're not creating those vertical slices

384
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,100
this is why things like Spiral came into

385
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:51,360
existence to kind of help with those

386
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,940
stories but this idea uh um is the the

387
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,800
change drops off very quickly we

388
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,959
maintain it for some time but it drops

389
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,899
off fairly quickly

390
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:03,240
and then our customers operational risk

391
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,579
operational risk always starts at a

392
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,260
hundred percent what is the risk to the

393
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,299
customer what's the customer's risk

394
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,880
they're looking at us going what's my

395
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,500
risk uh on whether these folks will

396
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,520
deliver what I think they're going to

397
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,880
deliver right so it starts very high

398
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,500
um and then it's obviously zero at the

399
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
end because we deliver our working

400
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,640
usable product at the end of every

401
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,520
project right that's that happens every

402
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,440
project but operational risk during the

403
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,059
life of the project remains very high it

404
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,220
maybe drops a little bit as they see

405
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,440
some of the things we've created maybe

406
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,140
there's a little dip maybe there's a

407
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,200
little dip there at the end as we go

408
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,600
into uat but the reality is we get to

409
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,480
the end and their risk drops to zero

410
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,000
only once we've delivered a working

411
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,740
usable uh product for them once we've

412
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,380
solved their business problem

413
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,200
and then if we look at realized value

414
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,200
how much value does the customer have

415
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,539
well it starts at zero they've got no

416
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,640
value and at the end of the product

417
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:09,539
cycle at the end of the 12 months they

418
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:12,660
have full value but during you know how

419
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,880
often do you actually deliver value to

420
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,840
the customer and I very specifically use

421
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,780
realized value uat does not count as

422
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,720
realized value uat does not actually

423
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:28,500
solve the customer's problem it's still

424
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,020
a pending problem so we don't have that

425
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,460
value realized until the end of the

426
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,940
product cycle

427
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,460
so hope hopefully you you agree or

428
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,799
mostly agree with the way I shape these

429
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,240
lines you maybe have little caveats but

430
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,880
I think it's not going to be that much

431
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,360
different from from what I've drawn

432
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,360
so let's take a another look and look at

433
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,520
uh I'm gonna put agile

434
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,320
but you might call it empirical it

435
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,500
doesn't really matter what word you use

436
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,600
agile's it's been agile since 2001 uh

437
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,820
before that it was just empiricism right

438
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,860
an empirical process

439
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,480
um and what we're going to do is at

440
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,360
least every month

441
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,120
at least every 30 days we're going to

442
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,539
have working product and it's going to

443
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,520
be in production okay

444
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,160
um so where where does visibility sit

445
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,080
well visibility

446
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,960
um sits fairly High throughout the life

447
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:30,840
of the project right so it starts high

448
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,419
and then every month we're going to have

449
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,480
I'm not probably not going to put 12 of

450
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,760
these little uh stars in there right uh

451
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,919
but every month they're going to have

452
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,780
that same level of visibility here are

453
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,600
all the things we created over the last

454
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,320
month please validate that it is what

455
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,320
we've created and during those sessions

456
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,900
you're going to have these uh little

457
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,360
little dips where we're not doing

458
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,799
anything I guess I could make that I

459
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,299
guess that could go all the way down

460
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,880
here right maybe

461
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,760
that kind of makes sense you know bring

462
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,799
it in line with the the the that idea of

463
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,780
not being able to see anything but we

464
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,600
have all of these touch points we have

465
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,340
12 touch points throughout the life of

466
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,919
the product where the customer is given

467
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,559
the ability to to give them the ability

468
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:22,020
to change potentially

469
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,480
also our ability to change over the life

470
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,360
of the product is is very different as

471
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,240
well right so we're going to start with

472
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,760
high ability to change in both cases

473
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,980
we've built nothing and in the end we're

474
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,620
gonna potentially have a low ability to

475
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,660
change in both cases we've built a

476
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,820
product right so now it's difficult to

477
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,700
change because a whole product exists 10

478
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,160
12 months worth of work versus uh no

479
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,220
work but the model is very different

480
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,799
because at the end because we're working

481
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,960
in in usable working increments at the

482
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,419
end of each month when we ship the

483
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,000
product the customer has the option to

484
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,400
change anything we've not started and it

485
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,960
has zero impact to our ability to

486
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,760
deliver it has zero impact on the

487
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,400
product and there's potentially zero

488
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,799
waste it's close to zero it's never zero

489
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,419
right but we have much lower waste when

490
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,940
they maintain that ability to change

491
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,559
anything we've not started so what you

492
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,140
end up with is you're still going to

493
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,740
drop because you're Building Product but

494
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,740
it's going to to be on a a kind of

495
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,660
different trajectory right we're we're

496
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,940
reducing our ability to change as we go

497
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,640
through the product but everything we've

498
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,980
not built yet still has the ability to

499
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,020
change and we even have the ability to

500
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,120
change existing stuff just like we did

501
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,280
in our traditional process

502
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,320
um but we're adding that to the ability

503
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,620
to change everything we've not started

504
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,039
if at the end of Sprint four month four

505
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:52,860
they want the customer wants to delete

506
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,360
our entire product backlog and build a

507
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,100
new one and that's what we work on

508
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,640
that's cool we can do that because

509
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,059
everything we have done so far is usable

510
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,039
and works it's production ready okay

511
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,539
that's that super power that we need in

512
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,220
order to get there

513
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:11,580
so how does that look for operational

514
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,620
risk well we're going to start in the

515
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,080
same place right and end in the same

516
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,039
place that's that that normal model

517
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,559
we're going to start in the same place

518
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,020
and end in the same place but in fact at

519
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,240
the end of the first month we've

520
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,360
alleviated some of the risk

521
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,280
right they have some working product

522
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,440
hopefully we've solved the most valuable

523
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,780
problem we can in the first 30 days

524
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
right what could we do in 30 days that's

525
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,500
what I do with teams is I get them in a

526
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,620
room and I say here's what the customer

527
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,539
wants what is the most valuable thing we

528
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,059
could do in this space in the next 30

529
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:46,740
days let's build that at the end of the

530
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,539
30 days you've got that you give it to

531
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,679
the customer and say are we going in the

532
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,900
right direction are we building

533
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,880
something that's valuable do you want to

534
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,919
change your mind it gives them that

535
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,140
visibility they can potentially we can

536
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,659
potentially ship it to production and

537
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,120
they can use it in production there's

538
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,880
all sorts of things we have to do to

539
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,820
allow that to happen but

540
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,159
what you end up with is this

541
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,080
direct trajectory

542
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:16,080
from top left to bottom right right

543
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,799
every single time we create a usable

544
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,179
working product we we have uh we

545
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,820
alleviate their the customer's

546
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,799
operational risk right we also alleviate

547
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,480
their fiscal risk their money is no

548
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,760
longer at risk because they have a

549
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,059
working product and yeah you might have

550
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,520
Sprints where uh you know something bad

551
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:38,400
happens and we we have a little Plateau

552
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,559
right that's entirely possible but

553
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,880
mostly you're going to you're hopefully

554
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,100
going to be delivering at the end of

555
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,380
every every Sprint a usable working

556
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,140
product that shows progress

557
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,000
right and then we've got

558
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,880
two things we need to talk about for

559
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,880
realized value we need to talk about if

560
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,860
we are in a traditional organization so

561
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,760
a hierarchical departmental model

562
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:06,059
top-down organization and we're we're

563
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,559
using agile practices in our team what

564
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,039
does that look like for the realization

565
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,740
of value realized value is value I have

566
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,120
so if you're creating value for me I

567
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,340
don't have something that you've

568
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,500
documented I don't have something that

569
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,860
you've built but not tested I don't have

570
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,780
it yet it's not value yet it's potential

571
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,840
value right that's correct but it's not

572
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,760
value for me yet as the customer and so

573
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,679
right at the beginning we start at the

574
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,260
bottom we go to the top and then we have

575
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,320
every month we're going to deliver

576
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,820
usable working products so every one of

577
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,760
these notches

578
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:44,059
is a delivery of value it's a delivery

579
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,059
of

580
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,720
it's a delivery of something that we can

581
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,299
use that we can get in front of our our

582
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,919
customer that we can have them kick the

583
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,980
tires on that they can have them tell us

584
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,200
that we were wrong or we were right and

585
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,840
there you'll be able to use it

586
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,580
so that's one option is we're in that

587
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,340
traditional organization where we're

588
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,919
handied here's 300 yeah well let me do

589
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,780
that here's the 300 requirements that

590
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,679
you want us to build and we're going to

591
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,900
build it

592
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,940
but in both of these models maybe a

593
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,640
little bit less in the agile model we're

594
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,559
still under that constraint of

595
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,720
so here we asked for we were asked for

596
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,299
300 things and we delivered 300 things

597
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,900
in both models but remember we talked

598
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:33,059
about the 65

599
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,760
that's used little if ever that's

600
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,740
included in those 300 things so what

601
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,919
could we do differently well what would

602
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,740
be great is if at the end of the first

603
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,779
month the customer gets the product and

604
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,360
they tell us about all of the things

605
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,100
that have changed right they get to look

606
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,620
at the product and decide they want

607
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,659
something different they get to tell us

608
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,740
about the way their business has changed

609
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,720
in the last uh uh 30 days

610
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,299
and perhaps there are a bunch of

611
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,820
features up here that they don't need

612
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,580
anymore right they made a business

613
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,039
decision and the world has changed so

614
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,559
they don't need those so instead they

615
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,580
replace that with something else and we

616
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,179
build

617
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,620
something else of value okay that's

618
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:21,659
probably too steep

619
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,120
that's too steep

620
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,039
let's do

621
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,779
something else of value and at the end

622
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,179
of the next month we build something

623
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,760
else of value because they decide they

624
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,340
don't need this piece and then we build

625
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,880
something else of value and perhaps at

626
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,520
this point right where we're almost at

627
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,220
that same value level as we created over

628
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,279
here they decide

629
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:50,880
we're done we were able to deliver early

630
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:54,240
we were able to finish the product this

631
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,000
is only possible if we're able to change

632
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,919
the requirements if the requirements are

633
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,480
fluid and in fact you don't want the

634
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,220
full requirements up front but we want

635
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,520
those fluid requirements so we can make

636
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,860
changes constantly and then hopefully

637
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,320
well that's a bad line we get somewhere

638
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,419
somewhere up here where we have this

639
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,480
much higher value product if we continue

640
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,760
to build it it's much more in keeping

641
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,539
with what it is that the customer wants

642
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,820
and we've minimized that 65 percent

643
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,919
of features not used we're still going

644
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,260
to build stuff that's not used and we

645
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,380
end up in that space

646
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:34,500
all of these things are predisposed on

647
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,679
having a working usable product at the

648
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,480
end of every iteration including the

649
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,900
first

650
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,659
that is not out with the bounds of every

651
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,059
single organization on the planet it is

652
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,360
something that for example the windows

653
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:53,340
team do on a weekly basis they create a

654
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,020
working usable product on a weekly basis

655
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,840
with four and a half thousand software

656
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,500
Engineers working on a product that is

657
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,220
just enormous if they can do it we can

658
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,740
all do it the only excuses we have is

659
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,320
the existing state of our system the

660
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,080
existing expectation of quality and

661
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,080
capability in our teams and in our

662
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,779
organizations okay we need to work on

663
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,539
those and we can all get these

664
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:23,700
capabilities and we can all be a little

665
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,799
bit more agile

666
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,380
so thanks for

recommend that you read is one is the

680
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,760
new new product development game that's

681
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:05,700
a 19 that's the 1986 Harvard Business

682
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,760
review article and also Stephen Dennings

683
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,080
book at the age of agile those are both

684
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,919
great works

685
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,919
you for listening
