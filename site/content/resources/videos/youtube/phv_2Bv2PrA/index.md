Agile is fundamentally about shortening the time it takes to deliver products to users and learning from that process. As I reflect on my journey as a professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) trainer with Scrum.org and a [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) trainer with Pro Kanban, I can’t help but notice how traditional management practices, which were born during the Industrial Revolution, no longer fit the modern landscape of work. 

### Understanding the Shift from Complicated to Complex

In the past, we operated in a world where a largely uneducated workforce was managed by a hierarchy of knowledgeable leaders. This model worked well for producing goods quickly, but it was designed for a different type of work—complicated work that could be simplified through standard operating procedures. 

However, the reality we face today is that the work we do is complex. Complexity generates surprises, and no amount of standardisation can turn complex work into something simple. This shift means that the flow of information within organisations has become heavier and slower, making it increasingly difficult to respond to market changes. 

### The Need for Agile Practices

Traditional [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}) frameworks like PMI and Prince2 were developed for a complicated world. They rely on the assumption that we can predict outcomes based on established processes. But in our current environment, where change is constant and unpredictable, we need a different approach. Agile emerged as a response to this complexity, offering a way to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing landscape.

### The Importance of Predictability

When I categorise the elements of [product development]({{< ref "/categories/product-development" >}})—requirements, technology, and people—it's clear that predictability is a significant challenge:

- **Requirements**: The Standish Group's Chaos Report reveals that 35% of requirements change over the life of a product, and 65% of what we build is rarely used. This highlights the waste in our processes. Customers often don’t know what they need until they see it, making upfront requirements gathering a flawed approach.

- **Technology**: While technology can be somewhat predictable, it is still subject to change. The tools and processes we use evolve, and we must be prepared to adapt our practices accordingly.

- **People**: Perhaps the least predictable element, human behaviour varies daily. Factors such as personal circumstances and team dynamics can significantly impact performance.

### Embracing Agile for Risk Mitigation

In the agile space, we tackle unpredictability by delivering working products on a regular cadence. This approach allows us to gather feedback and make informed decisions, reducing risk and waste. Instead of waiting until the end of a lengthy project to deliver value, we can provide usable increments throughout the development process.

Imagine a traditional project where you deliver a product only at the end of a 12-month cycle. Visibility is low during the project, and the risk to the customer remains high until the final delivery. In contrast, with agile practices, we maintain high visibility and the ability to adapt throughout the project. Each month, we deliver a working product, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.

### Realising Value in Agile

Realised value is crucial. In a traditional organisation, value is often only recognised at the end of a project. However, in an agile environment, we can deliver value incrementally. Each working product we release provides the customer with something tangible to evaluate, ensuring that we are aligned with their needs.

This fluidity in requirements allows us to pivot based on customer feedback, minimising the risk of building features that are ultimately unnecessary. The goal is to create a product that truly meets the customer's needs, rather than one that simply ticks boxes on a requirements list.

### Conclusion: The Path Forward

As I continue to work with teams and organisations, I emphasise the importance of embracing agile practices. The capabilities to deliver working products regularly are within reach for all organisations, regardless of size or complexity. The only barriers are the existing expectations and systems in place.

If you’re interested in exploring how these concepts can be applied in your organisation, I invite you to connect with me for a free consultation. Additionally, I highly recommend reading "The New New Product Development Game" and Stephen Denning's "At the Age of Agile" for further insights into agile practices.

Thank you for joining me on this journey of understanding agility in our complex world. Let’s work together to create a more responsive and effective approach to product development.
