  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In Agile, there's a common misconception that leads to what I like to call \"Agile Banditry.\" Product Owners, when misguided, can fall into the trap of treating their role as a project manager, dictating every step of the team’s progress like an overbearing taskmaster. This often leads to disengagement, frustration, and ultimately, a failed product. In this blog, we’ll explore the dangers of Agile Banditry and how Product Owners can avoid this trap, enabling their teams to thrive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-an-agile-bandit\"><strong>What is an Agile Bandit?</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Have you ever encountered a Product Owner as an Agile Bandit?</strong> I have. I once worked with a Product Owner who was obsessed with task-level planning. Every person on the team had a detailed Gantt chart—start times, end times, task dependencies—you name it. If the team followed this rigid plan perfectly, everything would supposedly work out just fine. But as you can guess, it didn’t.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This mindset embodies Agile Banditry. The Product Owner believes that controlling every little detail of the team’s work will result in success. They’re so focused on the plan that they miss the bigger picture.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-does-agile-banditry-fail\"><strong>Why Does Agile Banditry Fail?</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Lack of Flexibility</strong>: Agile is about being adaptive, not rigid. When you lock a team into a Gantt chart or micro-manage their tasks, you eliminate the room for creativity and flexibility.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Disengagement</strong>: When a Product Owner micromanages, the team loses autonomy. This lack of ownership over their work leads to disengagement. <strong>Have you ever seen a sad, unhappy group of people create an amazing product?</strong> Of course not! Happy, engaged teams build great products.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Focus on the Wrong Things</strong>: Instead of looking at goals, outcomes, and value, the Agile Bandit is stuck managing tasks. They’re worried about deadlines and checklists instead of focusing on delivering valuable products to customers.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-role-of-the-product-owner-in-agile\"><strong>The Role of the Product Owner in Agile</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>A Product Owner is <strong>not</strong> a Project Manager. They shouldn’t be obsessed with the minutiae of tasks, timelines, and dependencies. Their job is far more important.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-vision-value-and-validation\"><strong>Vision, Value, and Validation</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The role of the Product Owner centers around three key areas:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":1} -->\r\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Vision</strong>: Where are we going as a team? What is the ultimate goal of our product?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Value</strong>: What are we delivering to our users or customers? How does this product improve their lives?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Validation</strong>: Did we achieve what we set out to do? Are our users actually benefiting from the product?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If a Product Owner is overly focused on task-level planning, they lose sight of these core responsibilities. Instead, they need to trust the highly skilled team they’ve assembled. These are smart, capable individuals who know how to deliver amazing products. The Product Owner’s job is to guide them by providing a clear vision and ensuring the team stays focused on creating value.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-enabling-the-team-to-thrive\"><strong>Enabling the Team to Thrive</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Have you ever seen an unhappy team deliver amazing results?</strong> The answer is simple: unhappy teams don’t deliver. If you’ve got a Product Owner who is laser-focused on task management and work breakdowns, you’re not going to have an engaged, motivated team.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Engagement leads to quality</strong>: Happy, engaged people build great products. When a Product Owner focuses on enabling the team rather than controlling them, you unlock the team’s potential.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Product ownership through empowerment</strong>: A Product Owner should empower the team, not limit them. It’s about setting a vision, clarifying priorities, and then letting the team figure out how to get there.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overcoming-agile-banditry\"><strong>Overcoming Agile Banditry</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, what should a Product Owner do if they recognize Agile Bandit tendencies in themselves or their organization?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":1} -->\r\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Let go of old habits</strong>: Stop relying on detailed Gantt charts and micro-managed task lists.

Let them own their work. If they have autonomy, they’ll be more engaged, and that will reflect in the quality of the product.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Focus on collaboration</strong>: Agile is about teamwork, not top-down management. Encourage collaboration between team members and across departments. Instead of being a taskmaster, be a facilitator of discussions and decisions.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-personal-experience-a-team-in-crisis\"><strong>Personal Experience: A Team in Crisis</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let me share a personal example. I once worked with a team that had a Product Owner stuck in the Agile Bandit mindset. The Product Owner focused exclusively on delivering their detailed plan, and as a result, the team was disengaged. They didn’t care about the bigger picture—they were just trying to check boxes off a to-do list.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Product Owner didn’t trust the team to figure out how to solve problems. Instead, they were laser-focused on each individual’s task list. The result? The team was frustrated, morale was low, and productivity was abysmal. There was no collaboration, no innovation, and no passion for the work.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But when the Product Owner let go of the task management mentality and focused instead on outcomes and goals, the team’s attitude shifted. They became more engaged, more innovative, and more productive. The team owned the product and the work they were doing, and it showed in the final product.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-solution-stop-being-an-agile-bandit\"><strong>The Solution: Stop Being an Agile Bandit</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you’re a Product Owner struggling with Agile Bandit tendencies, it’s time to change.

How will you measure success?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Communicate the vision</strong>: Make sure your team understands the bigger picture. What is the product supposed to accomplish? Why does it matter to your customers?</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Empower your team</strong>: Stop micromanaging. Give your team the autonomy they need to be creative and solve problems on their own. When they own their work, they’ll be more motivated and deliver better results.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion-don-t-destroy-your-team-with-agile-banditry\"><strong>Conclusion: Don’t Destroy Your Team with Agile Banditry</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Agile Banditry doesn’t just hurt the Product Owner; it hurts the entire team and ultimately the product. To avoid falling into this trap:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Let go of rigid planning</strong> and focus on vision, value, and validation.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Trust your team</strong> to deliver amazing results when they’re given autonomy and support.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Prioritize engagement</strong>—happy, empowered teams build the best products.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
