1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,799
have you ever encountered the product

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,920
owner as an agile Bandit I have um I

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,599
worked with a product owner uh quite

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,960
some years ago um that believed that if

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,960
every single person on the

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,920
team just followed their detailed plan

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,599
and Gant chart with start times and end

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,199
times for all of the tasks if everybody

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,439
just followed that everything would work

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,920
out perfectly and the only reason it

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,200
doesn't work out perfectly is because

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,640
people don't follow his

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:46,600
plan that is an agile

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:51,719
Bandit a product owner is not a project

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:56,840
manager they're not uh uh looking at um

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,000
task to time they're focused on goals

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,879
and outcomes and what is it we're trying

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,960
to achieve and we've hired these super

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:08,360
smart H uh people to be able to deliver

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,560
these amazing products and a product

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:16,439
owner should be focused on Vision value

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,680
and validation where is it we're going

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,280
what is it we get out of

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,439
it and have we managed to actually get

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,680
there and in order for a product owner

26
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:31,119
to focus on those things they perhaps

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,520
need to let go of some of the things

28
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,159
that they've used in the past and focus

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,040
instead on enabling the team uh the

30
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,640
people around the product to be an

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,439
Engaged happy group of people have have

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
you ever met a sad unhappy group of

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,960
people that made amazing products or did

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,799
amazing things as a team I bet you

35
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
haven't cuz they don't exist happy

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,119
engaged people build great products and

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,960
if you've got a product owner who's

38
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,959
focused laser focused

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:12,560
on task and uh work breakdown you are

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,560
not going to have a happy engaged team

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,319
that is connected to the story that

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,840
we're trying to tell as a product that

43
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:26,120
person is an agile Bandit they shouldn't

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,480
be a product owner at all um they just

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,720
just it was just ter you should see the

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,720
team the team was just in a complete

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,319
mess that they they just didn't care all

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,239
they cared about was delivering stuff
