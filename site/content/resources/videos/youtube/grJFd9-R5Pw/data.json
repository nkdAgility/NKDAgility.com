    "description": "The Applying Professional Scrum (APS) course is one of NKD Agility's favourite #scrum courses to deliver because it makes the learning experience visceral. It isn't about the theory of #scrum, it's about living and breathing the experience of applying #scrum in a live environment.\n\nWhether you are a #scrummaster, #productowner, #developer, or aspiring #agileleader, this course is perfect for you. It is a simulation that captures how you currently work and solve complex problems, and then leads you through 4 sprints to teach you how to effectively apply #scrum in your own, unique context.\n\nSo, how does the APS course achieve that? Why is this such an effective #scrumtraining course in helping both individuals and teams leverage the power of #scrum?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the #APS course and how it helps people apply #scrum effectively.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/\n \nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
