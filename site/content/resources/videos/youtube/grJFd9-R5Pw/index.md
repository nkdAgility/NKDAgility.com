# How does the APS course help people apply scrum effectively?

The Applying Professional Scrum (APS) course is one of NKD Agility's favourite #scrum courses to deliver because it makes the learning experience visceral. It isn't about the theory of #scrum, it's about living and breathing the experience of applying #scrum in a live environment.

Whether you are a #scrummaster, #productowner, #developer, or aspiring #agileleader, this course is perfect for you. It is a simulation that captures how you currently work and solve complex problems, and then leads you through 4 sprints to teach you how to effectively apply #scrum in your own, unique context.

So, how does the APS course achieve that? Why is this such an effective #scrumtraining course in helping both individuals and teams leverage the power of #scrum?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the #APS course and how it helps people apply #scrum effectively.
