1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,500
how does the aps course

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,240
help people apply scrum effectively

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,520
well it kind of helps in a number of

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,119
ways

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,699
so because it's a practical class

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:30,359
they get experience during the class

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:32,700
understanding what is Scrum why it works

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,100
and how it would work for them right so

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,100
you've you the people that are

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,280
participating in the class by the end of

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,980
let's say the the

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,820
um the second half a

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,379
um have a have a firm grasp of scrum and

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,760
there's still two more Sprints after

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:57,539
that ones are uh

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,079
um how would you describe it like uh

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,899
dysfunctional dysfunctional people

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,220
attributes Discovery session

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,920
um and then the one after that's a kind

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,200
of scaling session if we if we get to

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,080
that don't always get to that

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,020
um but the

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,700
the last part of the class that we do

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,119
after we've done all of those those

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,460
things is we've kind of got got two two

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,799
main exercises one is a choice and the

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,740
other ones we I kind of always do

28
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,100
the choice one is is this a group of

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,180
people who have been doing scrum already

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,000
um and if they've been doing scrum

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,619
already then we do like a scrum tune-up

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,380
exercise

33
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,680
where they're effectively doing a

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,020
diffing exercise between the scrum they

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,820
just learned and the scrum they're doing

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,799
in their organization

37
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,840
so do a kind of diffing exercise kind of

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,180
what's different how they feel about

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,299
those changes get get that information

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,759
down we have a little uh exercise around

41
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,159
that the other option for that one is if

42
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,680
they've not been doing scrum uh then we

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,380
have a scrum startup exercise and in the

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,880
scrum startup exercise they're they're

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,319
you know who's going to be your product

46
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,180
owner who's going to be your scrum

47
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,560
master and where are you going to store

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,599
your backlog

49
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,239
how are you going to manage it just to

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
get them started and thinking about how

51
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,540
that's going to work in their

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,879
organization so those those two things

53
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,080
alone it's one or the other I don't do

54
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,480
both

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,340
um is is really good

56
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,400
but then the last one of the last

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,080
exercises that I do with groups is

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,220
creating uh organizational change

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,800
backlog

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,319
because the the people that know most

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,340
about how organizations need to be

62
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
different

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,879
in doing agile other people that are

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,680
actually doing the work that are

65
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,560
struggling within the bounds of the

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,000
processes that the organizations created

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,920
so by asking them to create that

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
organizational change backlog or add

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,180
things to the organizational change

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,220
backlog and they're thinking about all

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,800
the things that affect them

72
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,239
whereas when leadership adds things to

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,560
the organizational change backlog

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,959
they're probably thinking about things

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,879
that affect them right and they're

76
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,400
proxying the things that affect other

77
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,080
people what they think is going to be a

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
problem for other people

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,580
but when you get the people that have

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,700
just gone through this scrum class scrum

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,280
class and they realize what needs to be

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,540
different they start adding all sorts of

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,300
things to the class and sometimes

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,580
sometimes it's you know they'll add we

85
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,260
need more people trained in this so that

86
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,060
more people understand what it is we're

87
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,319
talking about that's always good for me

88
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,000
right

89
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,760
um but most of the time they're adding

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,620
things like well we've got this policy

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,799
in the organization this needs to change

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,180
or leadership's not engaged enough in

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,220
the story that we're trying to create

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,280
this needs to change

95
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,099
and it's very enlightening for

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,540
leadership if they're attending and I do

97
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,299
recommend that

98
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,280
um the time when I've seen the aps be

99
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,700
most effective

100
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,319
um I did a class for a number of classes

101
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,340
for a company in the US called back

102
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,939
country

103
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,939
there are clothing apparel uh ski type

104
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,280
place in Utah and we trained everybody

105
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,680
in the company from the CEO all the way

106
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,780
down to the to the guy who drives the

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
forklift in the warehouse was fantastic

108
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,740
and what was really interesting was the

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,900
guy that drives a forklift in the

110
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,940
warehouse at the end of the first half

111
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,740
day we did two full days for the class

112
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,620
but the end of the first half day he

113
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,180
went to his boss and said by the why the

114
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,280
hell am I here I don't want to be here

115
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,960
what is this crap you're having me learn

116
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,820
I don't see why it's valuable for me can

117
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,020
I just go back to driving my forklift in

118
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,199
the warehouse

119
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,080
uh but by the end of that day

120
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,139
he was the one standing at the board

121
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,180
engaging with the team uh asking them

122
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,400
questions or do we have this do we have

123
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,320
that how would this work because he

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,240
started to realize

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,520
how

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,919
the work that these Engineers were doing

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,540
that he didn't have any connection with

128
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,919
before he started to understand how the

129
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,900
work that they were doing

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,759
affected his world

131
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,639
because he's driving the forklift in the

132
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,440
warehouse he's got an iPad attached to

133
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,940
the to the forklift that's telling him

134
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,500
where all the stuff is in the warehouse

135
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,540
and What needs to go in the truck and

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,979
what order he needs to get things out

137
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,600
and pack it and all of those kind of

138
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,340
things and they're the ones that are

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,919
writing that software and he happened to

140
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,259
have people at his table because we just

141
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,580
self-select into teams that were

142
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,560
responsible for some of the things that

143
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,580
directly affected him

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,039
so he understood why it was important

145
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,620
that he'd be part of that process why he

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,600
needed to engage in that process and it

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,699
brought another dimension he's the

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,479
customer was in the class right inside

149
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,720
of this company but even the view that

150
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,160
the people in the room had of the CEOs

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,380
sitting there

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,080
and the CEOs participating in the class

153
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,539
and actually focusing for two full days

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,280
on the class because he saw how

155
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:07,199
important it was

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,120
um to that discussion and then when

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,400
you're having that discussion at the end

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,560
the organizational change backlog what

159
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,960
needs to change who's in the room that

160
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,060
can deal with it the CEO is sitting

161
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,620
right there and can here's the

162
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,300
organizational change backlog this is

163
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,960
yours now you need to do something with

164
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,000
it and that that that

165
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,740
whole thing really helps now that's

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,139
different in a public class right you're

167
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,000
not going to get uh everybody in a

168
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,860
company in the public class but you get

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,080
quite a lot of the things that I've

170
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,479
talked about there all the way to that

171
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,580
point there's maybe not the Epiphany

172
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,039
moment at the end when you're creating

173
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,319
the organizational change backlog and

174
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,819
for the organization as a whole

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,419
um but it's still still a great

176
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,419
experience
