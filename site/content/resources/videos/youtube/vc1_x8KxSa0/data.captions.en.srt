1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,000
Moving from a legacy mindset to modern

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,320
engineering practices is is more than

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,480
just technical, right? Engineering

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,560
excellence isn't just technical. It's a

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,039
cultural thing within the context of of

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,600
of your teams.

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:28,720
If if there isn't a a a a culture of

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,720
absorbing change, rolling with the

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,719
punches, if there isn't a culture of

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,200
continuous learning, of continuous

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,760
improvement, if there isn't a culture of

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
continuously adapting your processes to

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,360
what you learn, continuously adapting

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
your products and your vision to what

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
you learn, continuously adapting the

16
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,160
work items that you have based on what

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
you learn and how users engage with it,

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,640
then it's going to be very difficult to

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,680
move from from a from a a legacy

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,719
mindset, which is write it once and it

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,960
it's it's there for posterity. Um, to a

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,560
a continuously

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,600
refactored code base that adapts to your

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,000
business's needs in the same way uh uh

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,560
that your business's needs adapt, right?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Or at least as close behind as you

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,960
possibly can. Um, and that that

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,000
migration from um

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,680
I've got a legacy system because the the

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,840
reality the reality is that the Big Bang

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,360
rewrite is a complete fallacy. It hardly

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,799
ever works out and it hardly ever costs

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,920
what you think it's going to cost. It's

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,200
it's usually the most expensive way um

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
to to rebuild your software. And worse,

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
if you take all the software engineers

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,880
that built your existing legacy, poorly

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,079
coded, poorly architected product and

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,320
you have them rebuild a new product, why

40
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,320
would you think the outcome uh would be

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,719
any different? Why would the new product

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,520
be any more um um scalable, sustainable,

43
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,039
um adaptable, testable, maintainable,

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,879
right? All the ables. Um why would it be

45
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,239
more of those things than the old one? I

46
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,400
mean, it may be a a little bit more

47
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,640
because people learn over time, but it's

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,959
not going to be stick with it more. So,

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,720
the way it does work is you you need to

50
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,040
do you need you need to change your

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
product in place. You don't replace your

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,360
product wholesale. You don't build a new

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,599
version off on the side. I I see teams,

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
organizations do that all the time. I I

55
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,800
worked with an organization quite a few

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,319
years ago would be years ago and they

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,879
were on their fifth attempt at big bang

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,400
rewrite of this one product but they

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,840
were on their fifth attempt of it. Every

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,440
few years they had another attempt and

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,120
usually when times are good we're making

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,200
a lot of money and then something

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
happens in the market or whatever and

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
we're not making so much money. So

65
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,879
what's the project that we cut? this

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,160
this current existing product that's

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,200
providing us value and and cash flow or

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,120
this cost sync of a of an attempted

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,480
rewrite that is not providing any value

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,080
right now it's it's a total no-brainer

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
business decision you cancel the new

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,760
thing you and they been through six

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,560
attempts of it right this is super

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,080
common so what we do is we fix our

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:27,040
application in place

76
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,720
yes that's harder Yes, that costs more,

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,760
but it doesn't cost more than six

78
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,080
attempts at rewriting because you you

79
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,319
you do each thing right. You you've got

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,879
your application, you build a new piece,

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
you hook it in to the main application,

82
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
you do all the testing, validation.

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,120
Awesome. We've replaced that piece.

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,519
We've added value to the system. The

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
system is now faster, more scalable,

86
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,080
more sustainable because we've added

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,920
this new piece in and we designed it in

88
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
the way that solid principles that it's

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,519
adaptable and all those kind of things.

90
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
So we've got a new piece in but the rest

91
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,840
of our application is still legacy.

92
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
What's the next piece we need to go fix

93
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,000
and the piece after that? And if you

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,080
have many teams, you can tackle many

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,120
pieces at once and continuously

96
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,040
progress your um your your new

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,240
application emerges from the old one,

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,080
right? Um your new capabilities emerge

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,080
from the old one. And that's how you

100
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,840
build sustainable that's how you build

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,960
sustainable change. That's how you build

102
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,800
a sustainability mindset into your

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,320
teams, into the culture of your

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
organization,

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,479
that you're fixing things as you go,

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
that you're adapting things as you go,

107
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,680
that you're having to go back and clean

108
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,199
up your own messes, so don't make the

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,199
next mess. And that work to do that is

110
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,479
what teaches us, right, to to do it

111
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,720
better the first time, the second time,

112
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,120
right? when we're when we're

113
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
refactoring. Oh no, now now I now I've

114
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
built this thing. I realize how I should

115
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,440
have built it and I get a chance to

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
refactor it. I get a chance to change it

117
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
and do that continuously for your

118
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
application within the context of we're

119
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,919
still adding new features to our

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,400
application and you'll get to where you

121
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,199
need to be. It will take time. It will

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,680
probably take um longer than just

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,680
focusing on a big bang rewrite, but it's

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,479
less risky,

125
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,840
less chance of cancelling. Um and you do

126
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,240
both things. You rebuild your product

127
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,400
and you rebuild the culture of your

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
organization and the mindset from a

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,240
legacy mindset towards one of

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:53,199
engineering excellence. Um, and that's

131
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,560
something that I work with teams often

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:01,520
on the

133
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,400
that that idea of fixing things in

134
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
place, of adapting the things that we

135
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,680
already have. So, we're adding value,

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,720
not cost. And if you want your people to

137
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,840
be as ready as you need your platforms

138
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,720
to be, let us help you make that change

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
stick.
