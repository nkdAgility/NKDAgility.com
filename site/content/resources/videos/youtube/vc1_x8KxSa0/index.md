title: 'Why Big Bang Rewrites Fail: How Sustainable Change and Engineering Excellence Transform Legacy Systems'
short_title: 'Culture Shift: Legacy Mindset to Modern Practice'
description: Ditch the Big Bang rewrite. Discover why sustainable, in-place change drives true engineering excellence and lasting transformation in your teams.
tldr: Big Bang rewrites of legacy systems usually fail due to high costs, delays, and unchanged team mindsets, while incremental in-place improvements deliver ongoing value and reduce risk. Sustainable change comes from building a culture of continuous improvement and engineering excellence, where teams refactor and modernise systems piece by piece. Development managers should focus on fostering this culture and invest in gradual, disciplined transformation rather than risky all-at-once rewrites.

Moving from Legacy Mindset to Engineering Excellence: Why Big Bang Rewrites Fail and Sustainable Change Wins

Over the years, I’ve seen countless organisations wrestle with the challenge of moving from legacy systems to modern engineering practices. There’s a persistent myth that this is a purely technical journey—just swap out the old code for the new, and voilà, you’re modern. But the reality is far more nuanced. Engineering excellence isn’t just about technology; it’s fundamentally about culture.

Let’s be honest: if your teams don’t have a culture of absorbing change, rolling with the punches, and continuously learning, you’re going to struggle. If you’re not continuously improving, adapting your processes, your products, your vision, and even your backlog based on what you learn and how your users engage, then you’re stuck. You’re anchored to a legacy mindset—the idea that you write it once and it’s there for posterity. That’s not how modern, sustainable software is built.

**The Big Bang Rewrite Fallacy**

I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen organisations attempt the infamous “Big Bang” rewrite. The thinking goes: let’s build a shiny new system off to the side, then switch over when it’s ready. In theory, it sounds clean and efficient. In practice, it’s a disaster.

Here’s why:

- **It almost never works out as planned.** The costs spiral, the timelines slip, and the business value is nowhere to be seen.
- **You’re often using the same people who built the legacy system.** If the same team, with the same mindset and practices, builds the new product, why would you expect a different outcome? Maybe you’ll get a marginal improvement, but the fundamental issues remain.
- **It’s a business risk.** When budgets tighten, what gets cut? The cost sink of a rewrite that’s not delivering value, or the existing product that’s still bringing in revenue? It’s a no-brainer. The rewrite gets axed. I’ve seen organisations go through this cycle five, six times—each attempt more expensive and demoralising than the last.

**Sustainable Change: Fixing in Place**

So, what’s the alternative? You fix your application in place. Yes, it’s harder. Yes, it can feel slower. But it’s far less risky, and it’s the only way I’ve seen real, lasting change take root.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Identify a piece of your application to improve.**
2. **Build the new component, following solid engineering principles—adaptable, testable, maintainable.**
3. **Integrate it with the existing system.**
4. **Test, validate, and deploy.**
5. **Repeat.**

With each iteration, you’re adding value. The system becomes faster, more scalable, and more sustainable. The new capabilities emerge from the old, and over time, your legacy system is transformed—piece by piece—into something modern and robust.

If you have multiple teams, you can tackle several areas at once, accelerating the process. But the key is that you’re always delivering value, not just burning cash on a speculative rewrite.

**Building a Culture of Engineering Excellence**

This approach does more than just modernise your technology. It builds a culture of sustainability and engineering excellence:

- **Teams learn to clean up their own messes.** When you have to refactor and improve what you’ve built, you quickly learn to do it better next time.
- **Continuous improvement becomes the norm.** You’re always adapting, always learning, always getting better.
- **You reduce risk.** There’s less chance of cancellation, because you’re always delivering incremental value.

I’ve worked with teams across industries to make this shift. The organisations that succeed are the ones that embrace the hard work of fixing in place, that see every improvement as an investment in both their product and their people.

**My Advice: Make Change Stick**

If you want your people to be as ready as your platforms, focus on building a culture that values sustainable change. Don’t fall for the Big Bang rewrite myth. Instead, invest in continuous improvement, in-place refactoring, and a mindset of engineering excellence.

It will take time. It will require discipline, patience, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes. But the payoff—a resilient, adaptable product and a high-performing team—is worth every bit of effort.

If you’re ready to make that change stick, let’s talk. I’ve helped teams navigate this journey before, and I’d be happy to help yours do the same.
