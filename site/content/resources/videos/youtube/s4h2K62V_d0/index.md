# Shifting Left. Quality from the Start

# Shift Left: Building Quality In From the Start | Martin Hinshelwood  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I explore the transformative concept of **shifting left** in modern software engineering. Itâ€™s about integrating quality, security, and testing into the earliest stages of development, empowering teams to build better products and avoid the pitfalls of technical debt. From test-driven development to pair programming, Iâ€™ll share actionable insights and real-world examples that demonstrate why shifting left is a game-changer.

**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  

1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: What is Shift Left?  
2. 01:30 â€“ Why Shift Left is Controversial  
3. 04:00 â€“ Owning the Code: Build, Test, and Support  
4. 07:15 â€“ Key Skills for Modern Engineering Teams  
5. 10:00 â€“ Tools & Techniques: Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming  
6. 14:30 â€“ Lessons from the Azure DevOps Team  
7. 19:00 â€“ How Shifting Left Impacts Productivity and Innovation  
8. 22:00 â€“ Building a Culture of Engineering Excellence  

**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  

- Software engineers and developers seeking to improve product quality and reduce technical debt  
- Engineering managers and CTOs focused on scaling effective teams  
- Agile practitioners looking to integrate modern engineering practices into their workflow  

**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  

- Why shifting quality assurance earlier in the development cycle improves outcomes  
- The importance of engineering teams owning the entire product lifecycle, from development to production support  
- How test-driven development leads to better architectures  
- The productivity and innovation gains from pair programming  
- Real-world insights from the Azure DevOps teamâ€™s journey to continuous delivery  
- How shifting left minimizes production bugs, brand damage, and missed opportunities  

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  

- Shifting left empowers teams to "build quality in" rather than testing it in later.  
- Practices like pair programming and test-driven development may seem slower initially but drastically reduce costs and increase efficiency in the long run.  
- Paying down technical debt enables exponential productivity and value gains.  
- Iterating quickly through small experiments creates better products that resonate with customers.
