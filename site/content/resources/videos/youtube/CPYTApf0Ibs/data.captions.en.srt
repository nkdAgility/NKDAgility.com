1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,839
the second question that we should be

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:11,160
asking leadership of of organizations is

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:15,000
is there a product Vision that lays out

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,320
the Strategic goals and do all members

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,240
of the team all people doing work inside

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,519
of our

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,880
organization understand both of those

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,119
things and are they able to see how the

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,640
work they do everyday contributes to

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,759
both of them um this is this is really

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,680
lack in organizations it's probably more

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,480
lacking than creating usable working

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,320
product um most organizations that I've

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,160
worked with even if they do have a clear

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,719
uh uh product Vision vision for their

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,960
product and strategic goals for their

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
business it's not well communicated uh

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,079
to the people in the organization a key

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,760
key test for this is to go to folks in

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,879
your organization and ask them what what

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,600
the the Strategic goal is what's the

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,360
vision for the product what are the

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,479
Strategic goals for the business what's

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,119
the Strategic goals for the product and

25
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,840
if they aren't able to articulate

26
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:16,119
it then it doesn't exist in your

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,479
organization it it it might exist on

28
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,520
paper but if people aren't able to

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,119
internalize it and articulate it then

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,000
they don't understand it and it's not

31
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:30,680
there and the second part of that is

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,159
even more powerful and that's that

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,040
the people doing the work need to

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,840
understand how the things that they're

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,920
doing every day contribute to those

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,520
overall vision and goals right

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,600
because the doers in your

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,320
organization and management and

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
everybody in your organization are

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,840
making lots of little micro decisions

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,640
within the context that they understand

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,759
of what it is we're trying to do right

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,119
um they're going to make continuous

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,759
micro decisions software Engineers are

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,439
going to make decisions about what

46
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,200
architecture to choose about ways to

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,680
build things and they might talk to each

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,599
other or they might talk to nobody when

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,519
they make that little decision because

50
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,879
it's a little micro decision in order to

51
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,519
get somebody to help you with that

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,120
decision you need to impart the context

53
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,400
and quite often other people don't

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
understand the context because what

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,120
you're talking about is incredibly

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
technical it could be coding technical

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,640
it could be testing technical it could

58
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,800
be

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,560
uh uh Market technical it could be

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,000
marketing technical it could be could be

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,200
any sort of technical details so they

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,400
can't just go ask a boss ask a leader

63
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,920
ask uh uh somebody senior in the

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,920
organization because they don't

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,200
understand the context the only way to

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,879
enable those people because they're

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,319
going to make the decision anyway the

68
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,200
only way for you to enable them to make

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
more of the right decision and less of

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,800
the wrong decision is for them to

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
understand what it is you're trying to

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
achieve where it is we're going as a

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,680
business um what's our what are we

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,319
trying to do with our product where do

75
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,360
we think is going and that will enable

76
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,560
them to make more of the right decisions

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,360
and less of the wrong ones this is how

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,560
we maximize the amount of work not done

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,879
how we maximize the value that we

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,360
deliver to our to our customers because

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,599
the people that are doing the work if

82
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,450
they're not connected to that goal and

83
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,840
vision and what it is we're trying to

84
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,720
[Music]

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,840
achieve how do they value what it is

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
they're doing and they just turning up

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,599
for their day job and they're punching

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
you know like a machine punching cards

89
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,879
and then at the end of your day you go

90
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,439
home

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,959
or do you feel for the customer do you

92
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,560
understand the wants and needs for the

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,120
customer of the business of what it is

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,680
we're trying to achieve and part of that

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,159
is creating camaraderie creating this

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,280
story of are are we as a group all

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,200
working together towards a common goal

98
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,480
or are we potentially working against

99
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,079
each other because we all have our own

100
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,920
idea of what our common goal and vision

101
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,400
is and we're all doing our own thing and

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,720
perhaps pulling each other in different

103
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,000
directions within our business so do you

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,680
have that that alignment so that we can

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,880
share knowledge share decisions so that

106
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,160
we can um we're even decisions that we

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,479
make on our own are working towards a

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,840
common outcome and that's the very

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,320
definition of team right a group of

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,680
people working together towards a common

111
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,440
goal so you need to have clear product

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,400
vision and strategic goals and you need

113
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,560
to ensure that everybody that's working

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,520
on your product understands the vision

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,600
and the Strategic goals and also how the

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,639
work that they're doing every day

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
contributes to that so how can you help

118
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:05,160
them make those connections if your

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,919
answer to any one of these questions or

120
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,240
the answer of your business to any one

121
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:14,080
of these questions is no we're not doing

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,759
that then you would probably I probably

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,240
wouldn't consider that you're already in

124
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,639
the agile space right you're not already

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,199
agile you might be working towards it

126
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,280
and you might have put in loads of

127
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:33,560
effort but unless you can Mark every

128
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:37,160
single one of these six questions as yes

129
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,360
we do this this is how things work here

130
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,199
then we're still lacking we're still

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,520
trying we're still working towards being

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,759
agile now this is just a litmus test

133
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:54,520
dreamed up uh by uh the US Department of

134
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,400
Defense but they are probably the least

135
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,800
likely place for you to expect something

136
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,039
um with this High a bar to have come

137
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,199
from and I'm not going to um go into a

138
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,720
team uh and work with a team or a

139
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,160
company and if they're not doing these

140
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,800
things then I'm going to say well you

141
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,960
guys suck you're not agile because

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,919
you're not doing this that's that's not

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,440
how we work towards success uh but I

144
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,599
think it's hugely valuable from the

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,479
perspective of

146
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,039
self-reflection for you all to think

147
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,759
about the processes and practices in

148
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,039
your organization ation and are you a

149
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,199
how many of these six questions are you

150
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,280
able to achieve and what could you do to

151
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,479
make it a little bit easier for the

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
teams for the people doing the work to

153
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:51,880
work

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,880
towards this idea of not being agile BS
