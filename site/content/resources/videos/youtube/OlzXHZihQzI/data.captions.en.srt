1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,640
one of the great things about immersive

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,080
learning is that we

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,120
specifically give students the ability

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,639
to adapt their mental models it's not

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,360
something we force upon them or we can

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,560
actually you know you can lead a horse

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,000
to order but you can't make it drink

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,680
right you have to want to change your

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,320
mental models but the new format because

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,679
they're doing things in their

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,240
organization they're seeing how it works

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,519
they're seeing the benefits and the

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,480
negatives

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,719
they're hopefully able to change their

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,120
whole mental model so that they make

16
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,640
different choices in the future and

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,640
they're able to assimilate these core

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,120
agile practices into the way they do

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,120
things
