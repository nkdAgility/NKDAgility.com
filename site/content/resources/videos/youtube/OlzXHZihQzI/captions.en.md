One of the great things about immersive learning is that we specifically give students the ability to adapt their mental models. It's not something we force upon them, or we can actually, you know, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink, right? You have to want to change your mental models. But the new format, because they're doing things in their organisation, they're seeing how it works, they're seeing the benefits and the negatives. They're hopefully able to change their whole mental model so that they make different choices in the future, and they're able to assimilate these core agile practices into the way they do things.
