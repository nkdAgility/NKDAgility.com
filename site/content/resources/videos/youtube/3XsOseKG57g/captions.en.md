So what do people love most about the four-day trading format? It's not two full days. I think that's what they love most, right? I don't have to sit in a meeting or in a room for eight hours. That just sucks. I feel like the four half days is quite a good intermediary format. I think there's a better format coming, which is either going to be four half days over two weeks or eight half days over eight weeks, right?

But I think the four consecutive half days gives you enough time to absorb the content, do a bit of reading, right? Think about what it is that we've been working on and then come back the next day with more, better questions. I think that for me is the core value of the four half days over the two full days. I actually still do two full-day classes, and I really struggle in them to pay attention the whole day, right? Because that's a long day. But also, to really understand and rock the content, you kind of need that gap.

So having that four hours and then you've got the full 24 hours gap and then another four hours does seem to add value to the class. Thanks for watching the video.
