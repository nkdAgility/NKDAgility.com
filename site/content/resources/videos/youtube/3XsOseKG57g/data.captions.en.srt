1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,320
so what do people love most about the

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,120
four day trading format it's not two

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,240
full days I think that's what they love

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,920
most right I don't have to sit in a in a

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,080
meeting or in a room

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:26,160
for eight hours that that just sucks I

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,980
feel like the four four half days

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,359
is quite a good intermediary format I

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,540
think there's a there's a better format

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,120
coming which is either

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,000
um going to be four half days over two

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,160
weeks or eight half days over eight

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,340
weeks right

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,000
um but I think the

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,680
four half consecutive half days gives

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,640
you enough time to absorb the content do

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,980
a bit of a bit of reading right

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,760
[Music]

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,800
um

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,800
think about what it is that we've been

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,180
working on and then come back the next

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,820
day with more better questions I think

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,040
that for me is the core value of the

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,080
four half days over the two full days I

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,680
actually I still do two full day classes

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,380
and I really struggle in them to to

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,180
um to pay attention the whole day right

28
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,280
because it's it's that's that's a long

29
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
day but also

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,700
um to really understand and rock the

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,280
content right you kind of need that Gap

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,979
um so having that that four hours and

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,240
then you've got the full 24 hours Gap

34
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:42,799
and then uh um another four hours does

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,299
seem to add value to the class

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,100
