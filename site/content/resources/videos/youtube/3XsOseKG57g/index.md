# What do people love most about the 4-day training format?

#scrumorg have started a journey to more immersive learning experiences, and the 4-day #scrumcourses and #scrumcertification programs are the start of that journey.

Four hours of training, across four days, really helps people dive deep into the content and extract as much value from the learning experience. Some people choose evenings, others mornings, and others the afternoon sessions.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the things that people love most about the 4-day training formats.
