    "description": "Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management (EBM)\n\nüìò Introduction to the Differences Between Traditional and Evidence-Based Management\n\n- Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management:\n  - Many people ask about the distinction between traditional management and evidence-based management (EBM). Interestingly, evidence-based practices have existed for decades, and some managers were applying these techniques long before it became a formal approach. The key difference lies in how decisions are made: traditional management often relies on intuition or hierarchy, while EBM focuses on data-driven decisions.\n\nüîç Key Concepts in Traditional Management vs. EBM\n\n1. üìä Data-Driven Decisions in EBM:\n   - EBM requires the collection and interpretation of data to inform decision-making. Managers must assess the data to understand the potential impacts and outcomes.\n   - Traditional management often relies on two approaches:\n     - Intuitive decision-making: \"I'm the manager, I‚Äôll make the call.\"\n     - Escalation-based decision-making: \"Let me ask someone more senior to make the decision.\"\n  \n2. ü§î Measuring for Success:\n   - In traditional management, decisions may be made without considering the evidence or clear outcomes. Evidence-based management, on the other hand, asks critical questions:\n     - \"Why are we doing this?\"\n     - \"What do we hope the outcome will be?\"\n     - \"How will we measure success?\"\n\nüöÄ The Challenge of Evidence-Based Management\n\n1. üìà Vanity Metrics in Traditional Management:\n   - Traditional managers often use vanity metrics, focusing on numbers that make them look good rather than metrics that help the organization succeed. These metrics don‚Äôt provide an accurate picture of what‚Äôs happening at a larger scale, creating a suboptimal decision-making process.\n   \n   - Example: Story points and velocity are often used to measure productivity. While they can be helpful within a team, they don‚Äôt provide useful data for decisions at the organizational level.\n\n2. üí° Holistic Approach in EBM:\n   - EBM looks at the whole system rather than just one part. The focus is on whether the decisions made will help the entire organization achieve its goals, rather than just making an individual manager look good.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è Making Better Decisions with EBM\n\n1. üß† Collecting Evidence:\n   - In EBM, decisions are based on collecting and validating evidence. The key is to figure out whether the evidence is good or bad and then make informed decisions.\n\n2. üö´ Moving Beyond Vanity Metrics:\n   - Metrics like velocity or story points might make teams or managers feel productive, but they don‚Äôt provide the full picture of what‚Äôs truly driving success. EBM encourages focusing on outcomes and progress toward organizational goals, rather than surface-level metrics.\n\nüåü Conclusion: Why EBM is Superior to Traditional Management\n\n- EBM Encourages Better Decision-Making:\n  - Evidence-based management allows organizations to make decisions that are informed by data, which is critical for driving real outcomes and success.\n  \n- Moving Away from \"Making It Up\":\n  - Rather than relying on gut feelings or hierarchy to make decisions, EBM focuses on gathering and validating evidence to optimize success at every level of the organization.\n\n- Focus on the Bigger Picture:\n  - While traditional management may focus on metrics that benefit individuals, EBM looks at the whole system, ensuring decisions are made to benefit the entire organization and align with its goals.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to discover how we can help you lead with Evidence-based Management in your #productdevelopment and #agileprojectmanagement",
