# Traditional Management vs Evidence Based Management

### 🎯 **Video Summary: Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management (EBM)**

---

#### **📘 Introduction to the Differences Between Traditional and Evidence-Based Management**

- **Traditional Management vs. Evidence-Based Management**:
  - Many people ask about the distinction between traditional management and evidence-based management (EBM). Interestingly, evidence-based practices have existed for decades, and some managers were applying these techniques long before it became a formal approach. The key difference lies in **how decisions are made**: traditional management often relies on intuition or hierarchy, while EBM focuses on **data-driven decisions**.

---

#### **🔍 Key Concepts in Traditional Management vs. EBM**

1. **📊 Data-Driven Decisions in EBM**:
   - **EBM** requires the collection and interpretation of **data** to inform decision-making. Managers must assess the data to understand the potential impacts and outcomes.
   - Traditional management often relies on two approaches:
     - **Intuitive decision-making**: "I'm the manager, I’ll make the call."
     - **Escalation-based decision-making**: "Let me ask someone more senior to make the decision."
  
2. **🤔 Measuring for Success**:
   - In traditional management, decisions may be made without considering the evidence or clear outcomes. Evidence-based management, on the other hand, asks critical questions:
     - "Why are we doing this?"
     - "What do we hope the outcome will be?"
     - "How will we measure success?"

#### **🚀 The Challenge of Evidence-Based Management**

1. **📈 Vanity Metrics in Traditional Management**:
   - Traditional managers often use **vanity metrics**, focusing on numbers that **make them look good** rather than metrics that help the organization succeed. These metrics don’t provide an accurate picture of what’s happening at a larger scale, creating a **suboptimal decision-making** process.
   
   - **Example**: Story points and velocity are often used to measure productivity. While they can be helpful within a team, they **don’t provide useful data** for decisions at the organizational level.

2. **💡 Holistic Approach in EBM**:
   - EBM looks at the **whole system** rather than just one part. The focus is on whether the decisions made will help the entire organization achieve its goals, rather than just making an individual manager look good.

#### **⚖️ Making Better Decisions with EBM**

1. **🧠 Collecting Evidence**:
   - In EBM, decisions are based on **collecting and validating evidence**. The key is to figure out whether the evidence is good or bad and then make informed decisions.

2. **🚫 Moving Beyond Vanity Metrics**:
   - Metrics like velocity or story points might make teams or managers feel productive, but they **don’t provide the full picture** of what’s truly driving success. EBM encourages focusing on **outcomes** and progress toward organizational goals, rather than surface-level metrics.

---

#### **🌟 Conclusion: Why EBM is Superior to Traditional Management**

- **EBM Encourages Better Decision-Making**:
  - Evidence-based management allows organizations to make decisions that are informed by data, which is critical for driving real outcomes and success.
  
- **Moving Away from "Making It Up"**:
  - Rather than relying on gut feelings or hierarchy to make decisions, EBM focuses on gathering and validating evidence to **optimize success** at every level of the organization.

- **Focus on the Bigger Picture**:
  - While traditional management may focus on metrics that benefit individuals, **EBM** looks at the **whole system**, ensuring decisions are made to benefit the entire organization and align with its goals.
