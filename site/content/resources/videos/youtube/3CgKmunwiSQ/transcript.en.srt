1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
so I get a lot of questions about the

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,519
difference between traditional

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,719
management versus evidence-based

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,280
management um I'm not I'm not sure the

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,279
term traditional applies uh it's

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,800
interesting I I um had a book on

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,920
evidence-based management practices um

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,199
that I gave to my father about 10 years

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,160
ago when he was asking me what the heck

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,480
is it that you do and um I gave him this

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,920
this uh

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
book radical

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,120
management and he read the book and he

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,920
said oh that's what I've been doing for

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,360
the last 40 years in my company that's

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,520
the type of things trying to change the

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,640
organization and um um move people in a

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,239
particular direction and do all those

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,160
things so uh

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,960
maybe that's why traditional like if

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,640
people have been doing it 40 years ago

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,320
80 years ago then

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,439
it's the common management the the the

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,960
normal way people approach things

25
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,000
evidence-based management is

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,720
hard right if we're talking about the

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,119
differences between uh traditional

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,479
classic the way most people do things

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,360
common cause right um evidence-based

30
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,920
management is hard evidencebased

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,439
management is uh we have to collect data

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,680
we have to read the data and we have to

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,840
make informed

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,360
decisions how

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,439
uh uh uh most management decisions are

36
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,200
made are one of two

37
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,439
ways make it up I'm just going to decide

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,880
I'm the manager I'm the boss I will

39
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,439
decide and I make a decision right or I

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,719
ask somebody more senior to me to make

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,799
the decision right so escalation based

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:02:00,960
uh uh uh decision making and both are

43
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:05,039
bad both are bad we we we shouldn't be

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,960
making um decisions on multi-million

45
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,000
dollar Things based on or even smaller

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,920
than that right but based on just making

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,879
it up um we want to be asking why are we

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,560
doing this thing what do we hope the

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,480
outcome's going to be and how are we

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,120
going to measure it right we want

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,760
evidence to know that's why when we're

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,560
in court we don't make decisions based

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,239
on how we feel today right we collect a

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,519
bunch of evidence um we present that

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,159
evidence to a a group of people and a

56
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,640
group of people Analyze That evidence in

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,319
including you know not evidence Parts as

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,319
well how they feel about it how they

59
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,680
think about

60
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,120
it and they put it together into

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,239
something that is a coherent a coherent

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,440
decision um and that's what we would

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:01,440
like to see in in in management today

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
um most

65
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,840
[Music]

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,120
managers um

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,920
trying do evidence based decision

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,319
making unfortunately the evidence that

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
they choose to

70
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,159
accept um is generally whatever the

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,959
easiest data it is to collect um most of

72
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:28,480
that resolve revolves around s do

73
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,040
metrics right original estimate actuals

74
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,239
how far off course are way um people

75
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,080
talk about scope creep well you said you

76
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,360
were going to do this and it's changed

77
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,959
to this therefore the scope has changed

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,319
or

79
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,950
um oh what geez it's that that

80
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,080
traditional look at data

81
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,120
[Music]

82
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,560
um is

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,840
very what's a good way to describe it

84
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,959
vanity metrics that's the expression

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,680
I've not used in a while vanity metrics

86
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,840
are are the biggest part of this I I

87
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,120
want to create

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,400
metrics um for me as a manager I want to

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,280
have metrics that make me look

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:17,680
good I want to keep my job I want to um

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,840
perhaps get promoted um so I want to

92
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,120
create metrics that make me look good

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,520
that's that would be nice so uh that's

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,720
the ones I'm going to focus on that's

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,280
the ones I'm going to judge my um people

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,960
people that report to me by is the

97
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,120
metrics that I think make me look good

98
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,680
and unfortunately metrics that make you

99
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,120
look good right

100
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,919
suboptimal metric we're we're looking at

101
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,560
one part of the puzzle me right my me as

102
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,639
a manager I'm looking at one part of the

103
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,360
puzzle and I'm trying to make a decision

104
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,320
on how I measure Things based on one

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
part of the

106
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,000
puzzle but is my decision going to be

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
good for the whole thing for the whole

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,120
organization for the whole uh product or

109
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,560
organization team whatever it is um at

110
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,039
whatever level you're playing at is is

111
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
that going to be the right metric that's

112
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,800
going to help progress the the the the

113
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
outcomes the impacts the the goals that

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,600
we're trying to have as an organization

115
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,880
the vision um or is it just making me

116
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,520
look good and that's a suboptimal a

117
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,639
suboptimal metric we're not looking at

118
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,319
the whole system just part of the system

119
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:30,160
um and that's really common I see that

120
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,840
with story points and velocity right

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,039
ridiculous uh metrics to look at outside

122
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,440
of the context of internal to the team

123
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,600
um sry points and velocity can be useful

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,240
inside of a team actually I would maybe

125
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,919
disagree with my own statement there but

126
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,759
they might be useful within that context

127
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,039
but outside of the team no use

128
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,240
whatsoever any manager that makes a

129
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,639
decision based on velocity um any

130
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,039
product owner that makes a decision

131
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,880
based on velocity um you know sum of

132
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,800
story points per Sprint or some of tasks

133
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,840
whatever it is um it's just mental

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,560
that's vanity metrics that's we're

135
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,759
trying to make the Met massage the

136
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,280
metrics to make ourselves look good and

137
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,800
that's really the big difference between

138
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,800
traditional management and evidencebased

139
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,919
management evidence-based management is

140
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,919
about the evidence we're going to

141
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,919
collect the evidence we're going to try

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,319
and validate that evidence right is it

143
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,440
good evidence or is it bad evidence um

144
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,080
and then we're going to try and make

145
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,080
decisions based on on it rather than

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
just making stuff up
