There is a single passing reference to a 'product owner,' but no mention, exploration, or description of Product Developers as a role or accountability, nor coverage of their responsibilities, skills, or integration.

Although 'team-based analysis' and 'collaboration' are mentioned, they refer entirely to human group processes without integrating AI partnership, shared cognition between humans and AI, or any themes central to the Collective Intelligence category.

While some concepts such as outcome alignment, meaningful metrics, and continuous improvement echo OKR philosophy, these are explored through the lens of EBM, not as part of the OKR system.

While these correlate with some philosophical underpinnings of Agentic Engineering—such as decentralizing decisions and feedback-driven adaptation—the article never directly refers to agency (neither for developers nor AI), DevOps-infused craft, ethical AI integration, or engineering practices that maximize human/AI autonomy. There's a moderate conceptual overlap in terms of striving for empirical, systemic improvement and feedback loops, but the discussion remains at a management/process level. No explicit mention or depth about engineering methodologies, developer autonomy, observability, or AI-human collaboration, so most Agentic Engineering core themes are absent.",
