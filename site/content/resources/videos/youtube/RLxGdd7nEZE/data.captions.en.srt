1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,260
so the question is um what is the single

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,780
most valuable outcome that a Consulting

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,360
engagement can produce

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,320
man I'm struggling because can it be one

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,779
thing right is it is it it

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,699
let's let's apply some lean principle if

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,779
we can't get to a thing we need to go up

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,760
one level so perhaps

9
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:34,440
systemic change

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,420
some sort of actual change in in either

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,219
the behaviors because you've changed the

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,960
system right I mean that's ultimately

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,780
what we're trying to do is we're trying

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,440
to change the system within which uh the

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,200
organization is functioning in order to

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,579
get some business benefit right whether

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,780
that's a business benefit of the

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,000
engineering teams are able to work

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,680
faster or it's a business benefit that

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,020
the company is able to respond to the

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,360
market more quickly whatever that

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,219
business benefit is

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,080
that's the outcome that you're trying to

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,540
achieve and you're only going to get

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,820
that by actually changing the system and

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,840
quite often that's really difficult in

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,299
organizations because lots of people say

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,580
they want to change but then don't

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,100
actually want to do the things that they

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,799
need to do in order to change

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,920
we kind of quite often feel comfortable

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,380
with the way things are right

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,460
um and that can be

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,500
um

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,540
it can be real just really difficult to

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,400
to get people on board but when you do

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,100
have people on board and they're willing

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,200
to try new things and experiment knowing

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,220
that not every idea is going to work out

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,500
right then I think uh the single most

41
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,240
valuable outcome for a Consulting

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,700
engagement is

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
some kind of systemic change to the

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,520
system that enables something some

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,500
desire that the business is looking for

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,360
