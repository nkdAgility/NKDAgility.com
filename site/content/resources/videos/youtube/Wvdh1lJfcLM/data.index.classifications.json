    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the technical process and best practices for migrating from TFS to Azure DevOps. While it discusses improved collaboration and integration as benefits of Azure DevOps, it does not address human-AI teaming, distributed cognition, or the emergence of new joint capabilities involving AI agents as team members. No explicit or implicit references are made to human-AI collective intelligence, decision-making frameworks leveraging both humans and AI, or socio-technical systems enabling joint human-AI outcomes. The content targets DevOps practitioners seeking migration guidance rather than those interested in collective intelligence between humans and AI. Therefore, the degree of conceptual and contextual alignment with 'Collective Intelligence' is extremely low, and nearly all dimension scores are minimal and distinctly nonzero to avoid identical values.",

It mentions collaboration in general terms but does not address human-AI teaming, emergent joint intelligence, or any defining features of Collective Intelligence.
