1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,400
there's a number of migration services

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:09,200
that we we offer um they're kind of

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,160
related as two sets of of tools there's

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
there's Martin as your devops migration

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,000
tools which is uh on GitHub and

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,240
available for people to use but we help

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,680
people use it we do it for customers um

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,599
when they don't want to learn it

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,800
themselves so that's the um more

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,439
targeted migration tool so I want to

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
move I want to stuff I want to merge

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,920
stuff

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,239
um so that's that's that's that actual

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,640
moving individual work items around

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,120
that's what I want to do then then

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,960
that's our one of our services the other

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,760
one is a kind of managed import into

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,239
Azure devops uh Microsoft have a tool

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:56,680
called the Azure devops data migration

20
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,600
tool and that data migration tool takes

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,879
the whole thing so you might have a if

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,519
you're with how TFS I I always call on

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,799
Prem TFS and the server as your devops

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
just to avoid confusion right I know

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,560
they renamed the server to as your

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,080
devops but it as your devops server and

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,920
as your devops service and it's just

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,119
confusing TFS right so TFS has multiple

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,159
databases hanging off off it um and

30
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,320
those databases are the things that you

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
take and put up to to as your devop so

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,880
if you have 500 projects in one database

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
you're taking the whole thing thing but

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,560
you can't just take it because there are

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,000
things you could do to your TFS that are

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,640
not allowed in as your devops um there

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,640
are things that could have happened over

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,040
the years to your TFS that are not

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,119
allowed in as your devops and there are

40
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,759
things yeah I think I'm going to double

41
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,479
down on things you could have changed in

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,360
TFS that you're not allowed to do in as

43
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,200
your devot like increase the max

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,320
attachment size is one um there's loads

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:05,520
of them so Microsoft provide a bunch of

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,160
tools to validate your environment to

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,800
make sure it will work before you migr

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,360
it up and it has to meet the validation

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,800
before it will go to a your devop but

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,400
how do you do that you have to get onto

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,519
the latest version then you have to run

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,160
the tools then you have to fix all of

53
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,680
the stuff that it highlights and then

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,040
you've got to go so we provide a

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,280
