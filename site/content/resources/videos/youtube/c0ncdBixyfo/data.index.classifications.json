The author shares a personal anecdote about their time at a previous job, illustrating the disconnect between employees and management, which aligns well with the Personal category's emphasis on individual insights and experiences related to Agile and organisational culture. The depth of discussion is significant, as it includes specific examples and personal interpretations of the impact of leadership on employee engagement. However, while the content is rich in personal reflection, it also touches on broader themes of organisational behaviour and leadership, which slightly detracts from its alignment with the Personal category.",
