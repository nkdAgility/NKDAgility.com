1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,080
a common thing that I see happening in

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,519
scrum

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,680
teams and any product teams to be honest

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,320
any product teams is that they

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,279
have

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,439
contempt they have contempt for their

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,800
leadership they have contempt for their

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,480
company they have contempt for their

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,840
product they have contempt for their

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,559
customers and they have contempt for the

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,200
outcomes this is a little bit more than

12
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,840
they just don't care it's it's they they

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,320
actively

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,559
dislike uh have disdain for um choices

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,120
that are are are are made and this is

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,239
largely I think because those choices

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,120
are made in spite of their opinions and

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,160
their understanding of the product and

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,640
the future of the product and the dire

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,560
that the company needs to go and choices

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,600
are being made without

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,920
their support is not the right words

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,280
input might be the right

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,680
words um they don't feel like they're

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,360
listened

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,880
to on on on their on their teams or as

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,040
part of their organization and that

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,320
seems to be a trend of traditional

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
organizations right we're not we're

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,920
we're we're just going to we we're going

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,920
to that

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,240
pyramid right the the the alpha

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
organizations we're going to steer from

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,119
the top therefore we actually don't care

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,759
what the people on the ground say uh or

36
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,119
do or understand that's a relevant we're

37
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,680
making the decisions at the top and

38
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,520
unfortunately it's the people on the

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,759
ground that are tend to be closest to

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,320
the market it's the people at the top

41
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,840
that tend to be furthest away from the

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,560
market and this

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,840
constant

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
ignoring of the realities of the market

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,399
the realities of the situation the

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,800
realities of the product the realities

47
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,560
of the quality of the product breeds

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
contempt in the people that are doing

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,360
the work for the organization they work

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,720
for uh a great

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,560
example um is that I used to work for an

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,080
organization in the UK uh pretty near to

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,200
where where I live this was back when I

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,800
was an

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,959
employee and it was I think was it the

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,560
last employee job I had I think it was

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,560
no it wasn't the last one but it was one

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,400
of the last ones that I had um and there

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,760
was

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,640
absolute abject and constant

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,599
contempt by every single employee for

62
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,879
the organization they worked

63
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:02,799
for so much so much so that um they had

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,319
a nickname for the

65
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:09,120
company

66
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,560
uh the the the the company at the time I

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
don't think it exists anymore don't

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,680
think it exists anymore it was called

69
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,440
intelligent

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,360
Finance uh it was a like an experiment

71
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,560
it was one of the first internet

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Banks but the nickname that the

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,080
employees had as a as a group or at

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,799
least within the bounds of what I was

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,720
interacting with for the organization

76
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,840
they work for uh they change the

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,120
intelligent to

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,200
incompetent and the F in finance uh to a

79
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,040
a Scottish term for somebody who's not

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,080
very

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,599
smart um yes one of those types of FWS

82
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,040
right um it's even in the dictionary

83
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,159
here uh so if you're going to think of

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,680
your

85
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,480
company as

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,159
incompetent what does that mean for the

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,720
attitude and investment that people

88
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,120
bring to work every day it's going to

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,040
mean that it's it's it's reduced or

90
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,479
doesn't even exist uh there was a number

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,079
of things that kind of led to to that

92
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,280
feeling um I remember while I was there

93
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,600
there was a new CIO for the

94
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,320
organization uh this new CIO for the

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,280
organization um admitted that he had

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,560
trouble with email

97
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
so this is the Chief Information officer

98
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,800
for the

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,039
organization admitted that he struggled

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,039
to leverage email as a

101
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:46,840
tool right it's it's just you you can't

102
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:50,759
make that up right you couldn't make

103
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,680
that up uh the guy I sat next to uh at

104
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:58,280
my desk a user

105
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:00,680
experience person ux ux person and uh he

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,080
admitted to me that he he felt like he

107
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,000
was

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,520
unemployable because he'd worked there

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,560
for 4 years and not done anything

110
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,120
new right think about think about those

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,479
things this was this was back in

112
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:22,160
200 I don't know 2005

113
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:27,080
2006 so we're pretty far into Windows

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,800
2000 right we're pretty far into uh uh

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,560

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,319
abilities um five five years four or

117
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,720
five years into NET Framework and um I

118
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:43,840
had a I had an nt4 workstation as a net

119
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,840
developer nt4 does not

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,479
supportet so I had to it took me weeks

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,520
to get a badge and then I had to request

122
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,160
using my badge a machine to be installed

123
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,440
under my desk that ran Windows 2000 that

124
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I could then remote into from my desktop

125
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,319
these things together that that

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,880
disconnect right that's the focus here

127
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,919
that disconnect between what the people

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,800
are doing and what the organization

129
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,280
believes is happening in the Direction

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,460
They believe that they're going is that

131
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,120
problem that creates that kind of uh

132
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:28,120
[Music]

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,639
um disgust contempt for the organization

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,280
that people work for they don't believe

135
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,599
that it's going anywhere they don't

136
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,880
believe that it's they're just there for

137
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,039
the paycheck and that's it um I I quit I

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,960
was the shortest employee ever at this

139
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:47,400
organization um I quit after 6 weeks um

140
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:52,440
and the the the

141
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:55,440
the I did not want to exist in that

142
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,440
culture of contempt for their

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
organization and one of my favorite

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,280
saying is change your company or change

145
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,720
your

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,319
company right so I went with my feet and

147
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,319
walked out the

148
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:16,280
door what is your organizational culture

149
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,639
how do uh if you're in leadership how do

150
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,960
the people on the ground see your

151
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,840
organization do they believe in what

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,360
you're doing do they feel like they're

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,720
engaged and involved in what it is

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,960
you're trying to achieve do they feel

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,800
listen too these are all the

156
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,280
things that create a group of people

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,759
that are engaged and want to see the

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,440
organization

159
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:47,639
succeed unhappy sad people don't build

160
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,800
amazing products they build unhappy sad
