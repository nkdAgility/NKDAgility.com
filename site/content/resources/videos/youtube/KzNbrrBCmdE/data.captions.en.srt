1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,040
the flexibility that you gain by being

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,679
able to move things around ad hoc I I

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
can move this one team from here to here

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,120
I can move this one project from here to

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,000
here I can merge projects I can split

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,240
projects um that overrides in most cases

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,720
if you need it um the inflexibility on

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,760
how the data is formed right that that

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,359
that it's not quite as high fidelity as

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,400
as as some folks would like that they're

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,559
able to do it when they before is is is

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,960
is enough so I think I think flexibility

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,800
SL inflexibility depends on it's going

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,320
to be based on what it is that you're

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,079
trying to achieve what's the outcome

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,239
that you're doing um what's your goal

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,960
and and figuring out which is the best

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:53,480
method within that context um and doing

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,480
the best we can within that context
