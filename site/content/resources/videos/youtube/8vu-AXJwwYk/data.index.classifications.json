The discussion delves more into the consultant's perspective and approaches rather than providing an in-depth overview of any specific frameworks or their adaptation in various contexts. Therefore, the direct mentions are low, conceptual alignment with the framework category is moderate, and the depth of discussion surrounding actual frameworks is minimal.",
