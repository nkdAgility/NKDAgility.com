 In 2001, a group of brilliant #softwareengineers came together to define and articulate a new style of #productdevelopment based on their collective knowledge, experience, and experimentation with #agileframeworks.

It was a revolutionary new approach to #productdevelopment and #projectmanagement (for lack of a better word) that empowered teams to navigate complexity, uncertainty, volatility, and ambiguity.

If you have never built the solution or solved the problem before, you simply don't know what you don't know, and you cannot know how long something will take to build or how much that will cost to deliver. You won't know until you have built the solution or solved the problem.

This can be a frustrating thing for #managers and #leadership teams to hear because they want certainty and want to be able to effectively plan and budget for products and services.

So, how do you navigate complexity and yet still ensure that you are effective? How do you know whether your team are working on the most valuable products and solving the most compelling problems?

That's where a great #agileconsultant can have an enormous impact. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how a deeply experienced and knowledgeable #agileconsultant can help teams thrive in complex #productdevelopment environments.
