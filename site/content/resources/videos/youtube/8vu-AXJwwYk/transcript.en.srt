1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,880
foreign

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,059
how much of an impact can a great ideal

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,400
consultant have

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,039
I I think they can have a huge huge

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,980
impact because they're

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,199
they're not an agile consultant tends

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,359
not to be interested in hanging around

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,720
that that's the difference I feel

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,540
between Consulting and coaching like a

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
coach is going to be there all the time

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,280
but a consultant

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
can't be there all the time usually one

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,040
because they're more expensive right so

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,140
the company doesn't want them hanging

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,640
around for too long but really the

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,320
consultant is doing that deliberately

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,840
right if the company wants you around

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,200
full time you're not expensive enough

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,360
um because you you want to be coming in

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,440
helping them with very specific problems

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,640
they're the ones that are going to be

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,199
fixing

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,180
the problem they're the ones that are

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,140
going to be doing the work you're giving

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,260
them things to try or perhaps

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,360
um what what one of the

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,420
one of the things that I've done quite a

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,939
lot with organizations is

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,060
um I guess I call it the state of agile

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,520
report right and what is the current

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,080
state of the way things work inside of

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,619
the organization from the perspective of

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,240
agile and what are the things like what

34
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,180
are the top three things that the

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,100
organization should focus on improving

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,200
and so I'm not necessarily there to

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,479
solve any of those problems right I

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,360
maybe come in for a week or two weeks

39
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm going to interview 20 or 30 people

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,380
in the organization at all different

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,079
levels ask them questions about how they

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,840
work how they figure things out

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,000
um and you get a lot of answers that are

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,439
contradictory in that story right

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,780
because you get the people actually

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,700
doing the work saying yeah we don't

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,040
really write unit tests and we don't

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,299
really have automated builds but then

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,460
you speak to leadership and they're like

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,580
yeah we've got continuous delivery and

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,800
we've got uh uh all these unit tests

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,260
coming out of our ears and maybe we've

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,500
got too many unit tests and and there's

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,180
a fundamental disconnect there because

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,480
leadership and organizations will often

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,480
say

57
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,480
I I I I've heard in my uh uh on my

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,540
leadership Grapevine that we should be

59
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,760
doing unit tests and then

60
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,099
the teams feel Under Pressure to do unit

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,599
tests so they'll just tell them that

62
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,220
they've done unit tests because maybe

63
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,640
the product that they're working on is

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,800
absolutely impossible to do unit tests

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,360
but it's not possible to have that

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,280
conversation with leadership because

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,780
there's not an open and transparent

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,860
relationship going on there in the

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,379
organization

70
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,560
so being able to find and identify those

71
00:02:52,379 --> 00:03:00,480
problems figure out uh um um what it is

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,280
that oh and these are big things that

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,560
need to change not little things they're

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,200
not subtle things like coaches come in

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,580
and fixed subtle things and and work on

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,540
the bigger things over a longer period

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,220
of time

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,099
but

79
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,540
that often takes too long

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,819
because you're gonna put that out there

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,500
it takes too long what you want to be

82
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,379
able to do is go into an organization

83
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,420
see a switch on the wall that at the

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,099
bottom it says not continuous delivery

85
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,300
at the top it says continuous delivery

86
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,500
and you want to figure out how do I flip

87
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,659
that switch

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,840
how do I just turn that on how do I just

89
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,959
fix this problem and quite often you're

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,000
not always going to be right and I

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,040
always when I go into organizations I'm

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,340
always explaining that right I'm saying

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,140
I'm going to give you things to try they

94
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,019
might not work for you they maybe have

95
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,760
worked in other places but things to try

96
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,799
and they try them and either it works

97
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,360
for them or it doesn't right and then

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
they can come back and say well we tried

99
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,379
this and it didn't work but it worked a

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,599
little bit right so what else can we do

101
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,120
to figure this out and that's that

102
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,720
Consulting moment

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,700
um that I think coaches do as well right

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,439
but this is just taking that piece off

105
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,760
and saying let's just do this piece

106
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,760
because I feel that

107
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,940
organizations and leaders in

108
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,799
organizations

109
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,019
um people and organizations need to own

110
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,600
that problem themselves they're the one

111
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,580
that's their organization they're in the

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,259
crap that they're in they need to deal

113
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,320
with figuring out how to get out because

114
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,180
if you get somebody in who's given

115
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,120
accountability for changing that problem

116
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,040
but isn't really part of the company or

117
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,600
doesn't really understand the company it

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,040
can be very difficult for them to affect

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,300
change and that's why it takes longer

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
because then they have to build all of

121
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,580
those relationships before they can

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
change

123
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,660
but quite often when you come in as a

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,460
consultant

125
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,259
you're not worried about being fired

126
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,940
right that's the first thing because

127
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,380
you've got another gig next week and

128
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,600
you're not coming back

129
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,060
you might not be coming back at all so

130
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,340
you can just be absolutely brutally

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,440
honest in your reporting and say this is

132
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,660
what's going on your organization this

133
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,759
is why it's broken this is things you're

134
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,380
going you're going to need to fix I

135
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,900
recommend you go find a coach and help

136
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,300
you fix this thing but then they know

137
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,680
that's what they need to fix they have

138
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
it in the front of their mind and

139
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,979
they're potentially think they can see

140
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,660
that switch in the wall and like if we

141
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,940
could just flip that switch and they're

142
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,759
figuring out more things to do that

143
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,960
and and I think that's that's why I

144
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,479
think that great Consultants

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
can be more valuable

146
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,500
than great coaches

147
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,340
because their focus is on Flipping that

148
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,620
switch

149
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,220
as quickly as possible

150
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,800
um

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,139
and flipping things quickly like ripping

152
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,820
the Band-Aid off right you've got you

153
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,320
you don't want to peel it slowly because

154
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,600
that's going to hurt more

155
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,479
you want to just rip it off do something

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,940
different and deal with the Fallout of

157
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,500
that bigger change and I'm going to say

158
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,000
well it depends right that's why you

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,259
need a great consultant because the

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,940
great consultant is going to be able to

161
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,320
go yeah you want to slow change that one

162
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,900
and you want to Fast Change this one

163
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,100
right because if you slow change that

164
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
one it's going to be a problem and if

165
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,400
you fast change this one it's going to

166
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,860
be a problem and that that's

167
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,419
things that people feel are unique to

168
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,539
their organization

169
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,940
but they're really not I

170
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,919
one of the things that I always find

171
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,880
really interesting

172
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,380
is every single Consulting customer I've

173
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,380
ever worked with

174
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,259
has said we have these magical unique

175
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,180
problems and we need your help with them

176
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,860
and I go in and their problems are not

177
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,720
magical and they're not unique they're

178
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,180
the same problems that everybody else is

179
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,000
having there's little fine Nuance of

180
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,560
difference right but the big problem is

181
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,120
the big problem that everybody's having

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,940
and part of that comes from a a

183
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,720
tailorism to volatism right so from a

184
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:59,940
traditional uh hierarchical

185
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,199
um Industrial Revolution thinking

186
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:08,039
um focused on things changing to

187
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:10,380
um a democratized self-organization uh

188
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,960
distributed thinking focused on people

189
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,060
right so those are the one of the two

190
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,160
big

191
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,199
bridges that needs that that needs to

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,660
happen in organizations and but there's

193
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,120
lots of other things that are small that

194
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,280
they can do within those structures that

195
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,259
will enable them to do better

196
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,639
right but you've still got those big

197
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,680
problems that are the same everywhere

198
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,139
because everybody's trying to do this

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,720
this

200
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:39,900
decentralized self-organizing teams

201
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,840
but they're in a hierarchy with steering

202
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,419
and Leadership and control from the top

203
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,699
and they're they're just but they're

204
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,860
mutually exclusive right you can get a

205
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,000
little bit of this inside of this but

206
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,860
you can't

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,479
get all the way over here where people

208
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,280
want to be where they see the biggest

209
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,979
benefit in

210
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,900
um what they're getting so I feel that's

211
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,919
the value of a consultant is being able

212
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,680
to to come in and quickly identify and

213
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,539
point at things and that need to change

214
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,919
and a lot of these things are really

215
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,319
obvious when you come in from the

216
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,440
outside but they're not obvious at all

217
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,940
when you're inside of that story

218
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,819
um and having somebody come in and do it

219
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,599
I'll point out also quite often I come

220
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,280
in and the sponsor for me coming in says

221
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,440
here's the things we'd like you to tell

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,020
leadership right because they already

223
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,640
know what the problem is just nobody's

224
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,060
listening to them and they need somebody

225
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,860
else to come in and say yes this is

226
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,659
indeed a problem that you've been told a

227
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,940
whole bunch of times

228
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,099
um and I'm only going to do that if

229
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,860
those things are actually true right if

230
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,860
I'm gonna look and see but

231
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,200
um it's really valuable to have somebody

232
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,660
with knowledge an experience coming from

233
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,459
the outside that's maybe recognized

234
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,640
inside of the organization

235
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,800
in that traditional hierarchy to to help

236
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,380
make that start making those changes

237
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,339
across to the other side of the

238
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,339
other side of the wall
