    "description": "In 2001, a group of brilliant #softwareengineers came together to define and articulate a new style of #productdevelopment based on their collective knowledge, experience, and experimentation with #agileframeworks.\n\nIt was a revolutionary new approach to #productdevelopment and #projectmanagement (for lack of a better word) that empowered teams to navigate complexity, uncertainty, volatility, and ambiguity.\n\nIf you have never built the solution or solved the problem before, you simply don't know what you don't know, and you cannot know how long something will take to build or how much that will cost to deliver. You won't know until you have built the solution or solved the problem.\n\nThis can be a frustrating thing for #managers and #leadership teams to hear because they want certainty and want to be able to effectively plan and budget for products and services.\n\nSo, how do you navigate complexity and yet still ensure that you are effective? How do you know whether your team are working on the most valuable products and solving the most compelling problems?\n\nThat's where a great #agileconsultant can have an enormous impact. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how a deeply experienced and knowledgeable #agileconsultant can help teams thrive in complex #productdevelopment environments.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement \n#agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
