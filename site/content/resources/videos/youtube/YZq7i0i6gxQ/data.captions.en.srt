over here and press it there we go

36
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,839
okay

37
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,320
oh awesome now i can see you as well uh

38
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,920
cindy cindy alex ah see now we've got

39
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,240
people dropping in

40
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,240
and sharing it's it's it's it's when we

41
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,320
get that pop-up isn't it we get that

42
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,160
pop-up in windows to say

43
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
oh you've got a meeting okay well then

44
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,199
i'll go

45
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
but not before because that would be too

46
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,320
soon you're going to be fashionably

47
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,800
fashionably late

48
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,199
that's the idea i think

49
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,680
uh so i did post the mural in

50
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
the chat as well as in the

51
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,160
i think i posted it in the tool that i

52
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,560
used did i put the mural there oh i

53
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,720
maybe didn't so i will edit that

54
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,360
the workshop description and stick it in

55
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
there just now

56
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,360
right

57
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,360
i've put it in there and that way um

58
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,839
that way if people come late i don't

59
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
have to keep posting it in the chat

60
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,040
because you know what that's like with

61
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,040
this the temporary joining thing okay

62
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,880
marlena how are you doing

63
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,959
oh sorry not too bad thanks

64
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
that's my first time here so i was just

65
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,680
watching and

66
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,079
maybe something

67
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,120
well something you will come to realize

68
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,160
is there is no watching in uh

69
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,639
my sessions everybody uh workshops

70
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,440
everybody everybody participates uh but

71
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,079
it is it is fine there are no wrong

72
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,000
answers there's only things we can learn

73
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,959
and find out that's that's kind of the

74
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,759
point

75
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,240
um

76
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,040
so we're gonna um talk a little bit

77
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
about um agile leadership

78
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,480
i have

79
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,680
tried to create curate some content that

80
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,440
will help us into dive into some aspects

81
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,440
of agile leadership but we only have an

82
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,360
hour and a half you know we can't we

83
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,639
can't cover everything

84
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
um

85
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:44,240
and even in the i do a a two-day

86
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,120
agile leadership class for with

87
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
scrum.org even then you can't cover

88
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,079
everything that you might want to cover

89
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,519
um so let's uh i'm going to start off

90
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,720
with a little introductory exercise here

91
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
i have

92
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
a set of statements

93
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,320
in a box so i'm going to summon

94
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,600
everybody on the mural

95
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,520
there we go um so i have five

96
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,400
effectively five rooms here and each

97
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
room

98
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
has seven questions

99
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
okay

100
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,240
and what we are going to do is we are

101
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,959
going to either

102
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,559
answer with uh a yes

103
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
or a no

104
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,720
to any of those questions i'm just

105
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
putting some uh

106
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,520
ticks

107
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,080
and crosses

108
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,480
around our view for us so that we can

109
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,919
grab them

110
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,600
there we go we can always get more you

111
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
can always copy and paste

112
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,200
uh so that will get more but if you if

113
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,440
you zoom in to one of the items when i

114
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,000
put you in breakout rooms

115
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,039
i'd like you to go to

116
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,960
the the box that represents the number

117
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
of your room so at the top of the teams

118
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
window

119
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,760
and on the title bar it will tell you

120
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,720
the room number right so say room one

121
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,480
room two room three um and

122
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,000
we will uh

123
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,760
i want you to discuss and answer

124
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,840
the questions

125
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,760
that you see there so the statements

126
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
rather than questions

127
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,840
so um

128
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,760
let's see who have we got let's do

129
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,520
everybody's in alphabetical order so

130
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,360
i'll just do

131
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,160
that for room one

132
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,520
oh

133
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
one two

134
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,559
three

135
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,840
for room two

136
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,160
one two

137
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,440
oh there's two sharons i'll fix that one

138
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,240
two three

139
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,240
for room four

140
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
and then i think

141
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,320
well i'll put the other sharon in room

142
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,559
four as well

143
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,559
because then that will uh hopefully

144
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,520
so right i'm assigning everybody to the

145
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,520
rooms as new people drop in i'll send

146
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,280
them in to meet with you okay so it

147
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,080
depends how many people we get

148
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,880
and i'd like you to just drag on

149
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
a tick or a cross

150
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,679
to

151
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,480
each of those statements just agree in

152
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,039
your group uh there should be at least

153
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,480
three people in each group for you to

154
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,480
have that conversation with okay

155
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,039
so i'm going to open the room just now

156
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,520
you will just transcend into your

157
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,360
breakout rooms and then come back uh

158
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,679
when uh we're finished

159
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,360
um i don't think it will we'll probably

160
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,440
i'll probably put five or six minutes on

161
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,600
the timer and i'll see how you get on

162
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,200
okay

163
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,919
i'll i'll be monitoring from here

164
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,400
uh we have amanda

165
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,400

166
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880

167
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,400

183
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,720

uh no her name is andrea andrea okay

190
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,159

a setting in teams

192
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,840

295
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,200
pretty

296
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,960
all right peter's just going to answer

305
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,960
them all correctly now

306
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,919
peter i saw you looking at the answers

307
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,480
before you answered them

308
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,480
no i didn't actually

309
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,399
okay

310
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,120
with those interesting questions

311
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:01,000
oh my video is frozen again

312
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,000
with those interesting questions

313
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,960
they spark some debate

314
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,559
pretty interesting discussions

315
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,640
yeah

316
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,240
so on the right hand side

317
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,679
um if you're in the mural and you're

318
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
following me i'll summon everybody there

319
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
we go we get 18 people in the mural i'm

320
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,279
not sure we've got 18 people in here yet

321
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,520
um i put the team's link oh no we do i

322
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,320
put the teams link on the on the mural

323
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
there

324
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,159
just in case some folks were having a

325
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
hard time uh finding it

326
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,120
um

327
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,760
but there's the the

328
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:37,919
well the answers i'm giving i guess oh

329
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
i'm frozen again dagnammit

330
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,159
i i have i have two cameras and one of

331
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,159
them's playing up so i'll be using this

332
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,440
one it means i'm not looking at you i

333
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
apologize

334
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
um

335
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,799
but we'll figure i'll figure that out

336
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,760
for for later

337
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,640
um

338
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,480
so

339
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,399
we had a number of questions

340
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,039
uh if teams are failing then i'm failing

341
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,600
as a leader

342
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,840
right seems to be the oh well there's

343
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,600
some confusion in group one

344
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
they want to they want they want both

345
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
true and false

346
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,039
in both of those answers and and the and

347
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,480
the the red x is much bigger than the

348
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,399
green tick so somebody didn't like the

349
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
green tech he made made it smaller

350
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,960
right

351
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,960
so i i i would say if if you've got

352
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,240
failing teams

353
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,279
for me that's a leadership issue

354
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,919
right

355
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,880
we as leaders

356
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,799
are

357
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,399
responsible

358
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:39,039
for the effectiveness of our teams

359
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,039
we're going to help them get better at

360
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,720
working together get better at doing

361
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,679
things and

362
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,679
sometimes that's hard

363
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,240
if if your teams are succeeding

364
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,080
then you are succeeding as a leader

365
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,720
right the job of a leader is not to

366
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
manage up

367
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,679
right although sometimes we end up

368
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,080
managing up a lot

369
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,679
job of a leader is to help create an

370
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,279
environment within which the people

371
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,080
doing the work

372
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,080
can get it done

373
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,440
removing obstacles from their path

374
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,960
changing at things in the organization

375
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,960
getting them the things they need

376
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,399
leadership can be tough

377
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
uh

378
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,960
i like this one a leader must never show

379
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,960
emotion or people will perceive them as

380
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,880
weak

381
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,840
have you heard that expression

382
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,960
because i've heard that expression from

383
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,679
leaders yeah

384
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
alex is nodding there

385
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,960
luckily everybody marked that one as a

386
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,360
as a cross so that's good

387
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,120
a leader's job is to create goals and

388
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,120
enable people

389
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,120
almost everybody put a tick in that one

390
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,640
yeah

391
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,720
if we're telling people what to do

392
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,120
and how to do it

393
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,240
we're not leaders we're managers

394
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,440
but we agreed that he should be um

395
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,320
he is a part of the team and whole team

396
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,960
should uh create their goals so in this

397
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,840
way it could be true

398
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
so

399
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,000
i i agree

400
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,799
but if we look at

401
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
leadership at the macro rather than the

402
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,519
micro

403
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,399
level i might not be a leader on a team

404
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,519
i might be a leader in an organization

405
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,519
i have

406
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,399
20 or 30 teams

407
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,919
um

408
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:41,039
that that work within my department

409
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,720
um and i'm leading 20 or 30 teams it

410
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,799
doesn't have to be

411
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,760
one team one leader

412
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,039
right

413
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,440
the leader

414
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,120
that's on the team

415
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,120
is is usually the scrum master

416
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,880
right the scrum guide talks about the

417
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,360
scrum master as being a true leader

418
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,399
who provides services to the team the

419
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,039
product owner and the organization

420
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,320
right they're the embedded

421
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,919
leader

422
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,559
but we still have leaders at other

423
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,559
levels in our organizations

424
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,120
and even if we're

425
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,880
on the team

426
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,159
we want to enable the team to create

427
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,960
goals

428
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,960
and help enable people

429
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,919
if we're higher up in the organization

430
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,399
maybe we're setting goals in strategic

431
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,399
direction

432
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,240
i will have to find out what's

433
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,240
interfering with my camera

434
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
um i like that one a leader must make

435
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
every decision everybody was unanimous

436
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,320
that was good i'm happy that everybody

437
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,679
was unanimous there and that

438
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,159
leaders don't necessarily make all the

439
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,159
decisions

440
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,840
and everybody almost everybody was

441
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,519
unanimous that people need to be

442
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,240
inspired

443
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,240
by the leaders

444
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,279
if if you're

445
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,399
if you're uninspired by the work

446
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,679
do you do good work

447
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,840
if you're looking at the thing you've

448
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,840
been asked to do and going i don't care

449
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,679
are you going to do that work well

450
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,679
you're going to be effective

451
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,519
no we're kind of gonna well

452
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,600
we don't care

453
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,760
but if we're inspired

454
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,799
to that work if we're excited about that

455
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,480
work if we're invested in that work

456
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,320
we're gonna put more into it and that

457
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,320
will be obvious in the outcomes of the

458
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,370
work

459
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,600
leaders job is to inspire

460
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,279
[Music]

461
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,120
sometimes understanding the impact of

462
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
our work can make a difference right in

463
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,240
the way we do it

464
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,360
yeah understanding understanding the

465
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,799
impact is is really

466
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,799
important

467
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,480
um for for how we conceive of of goals

468
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,320
and direction

469
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,159
right what is it we're trying to achieve

470
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,840
what impact

471
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,159
in the world are we trying to achieve

472
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,639
with the work that we do

473
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,079
right and that might be

474
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,320
depending on the maturity of your

475
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,359
organization that you might not be

476
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,960
looking at impacts yet

477
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,679
right you might still be focused on

478
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,919
output

479
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,240
oh we need 20 more widgets per day

480
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,000
okay okay but what value does that

481
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,839
provide to people who really cares about

482
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,079
these widgets does producing 20 widgets

483
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,800
get you 20 times more value or should

484
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,760
you be looking at something else

485
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,760
what's more about us

486
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
well so but that's isn't that the

487
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,639
difference between a boss and a leader

488
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,000
right a boss says i need 20 more mid

489
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,720
widgets

490
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,560
a leader says we need to move this

491
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,320
needle

492
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,400
right we need to we need happier

493
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,839
customers what what can i do to help you

494
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,839
create happier customers

495
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,119
yeah

496
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,400
and i love the one in the in the middle

497
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,400
leader doesn't need to trust people

498
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,240
so what why do most

499
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,599
management practices predispose

500
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,599
untrustworthy employees

501
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,160
because they do

502
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,280
right during the industrial revolution

503
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,560
we had large amounts of uneducated

504
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,320
workforce

505
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,040
and we were asking them to do boring

506
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480
monotonous work

507
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,480
when they're doing boring monotonous

508
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,119
work their brain disconnected from the

509
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,079
work as yours does when you do boring

510
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,079
monotonous work

511
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,280
and then you figure out what can i do

512
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,880
not to have to do this work because it's

513
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,680
boring monotonous and i don't care i

514
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,680
just want my paycheck

515
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,640
those

516
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,440
characteristics of that type of work

517
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,640
created this idea of untrustworthy

518
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
employees

519
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,680
that has

520
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
gone through the years and is still

521
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,640
prevalent today in management styles and

522
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,640
management practices

523
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,800
and it's how do we how do we combat that

524
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,359
and trust people more

525
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
so we can delegate more

526
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,960
because you wouldn't delegate to the

527
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,160
uneducated factory worker would you

528
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,720
but you would delegate to the the smart

529
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,160
knowledgeable educated people that we

530
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,560
have today

531
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,200
[Music]

532
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,040
i would have to be a very unusual

533
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,119
and uh a capable and uneducated factory

534
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,560
worker that we would we would delegate

535
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,920
to right i'm not saying it wouldn't

536
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
happen it's just going to be rare

537
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,560
did you have any insights anna going

538
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,560
through those questions

539
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,119
nope looking for the mute button

540
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,119
it's always fun

541
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,720
uh i

542
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:32,240
does not agree with the second one

543
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,320
because you mean leader by position

544
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,839
there might be their own position but

545
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,040
there might be a true leader in the team

546
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,160
so the leader by position can be not so

547
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,560
good

548
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,560
but if you have a true leader in the

549
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,359
team there will be succeed

550
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,359
and if that's not

551
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,200
i agree with you

552
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,400
100

553
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:07,680
if i change the wording

554
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,680
to be as an effective leader

555
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,040
i think that might

556
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,280
caveat

557
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,200
your issue there like i i'm definitely

558
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
not saying that

559
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,720
you can have successful teams because

560
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,760
the leader is on the team in spite of

561
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,160
somebody more senior who is inept

562
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,000
absol absolutely

563
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,079
but then i would say that leadership

564
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,920
lies with that person who is the leader

565
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,680
not the inept person who has the

566
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,520
authority

567
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,920
authority and leadership are not the

568
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,920
same thing

569
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,079
the person who's the boss is not always

570
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,160
the leader

571
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,480
in an organization the management thinks

572
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,040
that the team leader in position is

573
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,720
doing all the good stuff which is not

574
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,160
true this is this is unfortunately

575
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,960
there's a

576
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,040
there's a there's an old adage that says

577
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,839
that we are promoted to the levels of

578
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,960
incompetence

579
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,320
right

580
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,480
and it's because

581
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,440
people are good at what they do right i

582
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,960
might be a really good software engineer

583
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,880
so somebody thinks i'll make a good

584
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,040
manager

585
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,280
of software engineers so they make me a

586
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,599
manager of software engineers and i suck

587
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,760
at managing software engineers

588
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,000
so they can't demote me but they're not

589
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,000
going to let me go any higher so now all

590
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,240
these software engineers are stuck with

591
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,480
a bad leader a bad manager right

592
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,320
um

593
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,640
i think as we as we change the way we

594
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,320
approach leadership

595
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,440
leadership of

596
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,119
time leadership so management in times

597
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,960
past

598
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,960
right like the stuff that came out of

599
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,560
the industrial revolution the scientific

600
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,839
management method

601
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,760
were really designed around low empathy

602
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,119
managers you wanted low empathy managers

603
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,560
because they might have to turn around

604
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,560
and fire 500 workers

605
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,160
and they're just cogs in a machine so

606
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:08,640
nobody cares

607
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,079
right i mean the workers care for sure

608
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,880
right but leadership doesn't care

609
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,560
management doesn't scare their resources

610
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,880
that's why lots of organizations call

611
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,280
people resources because then it does it

612
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,880
feels bad when you fire people

613
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
right but we're just going to get rid of

614
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,800
some resources we're going to refresh

615
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,800
some resources

616
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,599
right that's it's where that mentality

617
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,079
came from

618
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,440
but as we move into knowledge working

619
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,079
space we need empathetic leaders

620
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,800
leaders

621
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,960
oh i've got a little bit of an echo um

622
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,359
sg i'm just gonna mute you there there

623
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,599
was some background echo

624
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,040
um as we move into

625
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,079
knowledge working

626
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,079
we we we need empathetic leaders that

627
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,240
are able to

628
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,440
be leaders help remove impediments help

629
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,000
deal with our our team and our people's

630
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,680
maturity level and emotional safety and

631
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
all of those things that your

632
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,760
traditional manager couldn't care less

633
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,079
about and why don't you just be more of

634
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,079
a professional alex

635
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,280
i don't mind you gonna have unhappy

636
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,800
unhappy

637
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,839
time with this team i don't care you

638
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,040
should be a

639
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,119
professional right that's that's not

640
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,520
good leadership that's maybe good

641
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,680
management

642
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,839
well maybe good's probably

643
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,760
probably pushing it a little bit

644
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,119
i've heard even worse

645
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,520
what you were mentioning about the

646
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,400
resources before

647
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,480
uh i came across a manager who was

648
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,760
saying you know the products life's

649
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,160
lifetime is shortening it's all

650
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
so the same with the resources

651
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,920
meaning about the people that they need

652
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,160
to turn and leave after two years or

653
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,079
something you need to fresh

654
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,599
resources

655
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,839
yeah i i have i have worked in jobs

656
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,560
where

657
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,520
the management style was

658
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,640
work people hard burn them out because

659
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,839
there's always new people coming in

660
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,040
right that we can take advantage of

661
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,839
is the undertone there that is not not

662
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,839
well set

663
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,400
right

664
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,240
i did i did i i worked for a new media

665
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,720
design agency

666
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,960
um second job out of university it was

667
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,599
new media at the time grey hair it was

668
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,599
new media it means an internet agency

669
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,720
right web-based agency

670
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,240
and uh i i was getting 16 000 pounds a

671
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,640
year

672
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,800
i worked 70 to 80 hours a week

673
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,280
and at the end of that year i got my

674
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,839
bonus handy to me and it was 250 pounds

675
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,000
yeah it's like whoa i can buy that you

676
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,520
know couple of xbox games i wanted or

677
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
whatever was that

678
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,000
yeah

679
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,480
i kind of got handed the bonus and i

680
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,200
handed over my notice was kind of not

681
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,119
quite how it worked um i became unhappy

682
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,400
in that job can you imagine can you

683
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,520
imagine

684
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,520
yeah

685
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,480
i did i feel valued as an employee

686
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,640
no

687
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,280
did i feel like i wanted to go the extra

688
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,520
mile to help the business

689
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,040
cope with their inability to plan

690
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,119
right because you know how planning goes

691
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,400
in a lot of organizations no i didn't

692
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,400
feel motivated to do that

693
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,839
i didn't care to help them because they

694
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,800
didn't

695
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,880
seem to care about me

696
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,680
how do we prevent that well there are a

697
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,720
number of things um that we can we can

698
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,880
look at

699
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,920
um one of the things that's really

700
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,000
important is goals

701
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,240
okay we need uh

702
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,200
goals because

703
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,480
we

704
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,880
has anybody read a book by dan pink

705
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,280
or maybe watched the youtube video

706
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,359
alex has i know you have alex um i

707
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,440
heartily recommend it

708
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,520
and he wrote a book called drive the

709
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,200
surprising truth about what motivates

710
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,359
people

711
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,839
right and in it he talked about the

712
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,359
difference between our extrinsic

713
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,319
motivators

714
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,319
which are when you as an individual are

715
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,240
worried about putting food on the table

716
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,000
and a roof over your head all you care

717
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,760
about is money

718
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,200
right that's worries coming in from the

719
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,440
outside

720
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,319
once you don't have those worries and i

721
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,319
hope

722
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,760
that none of you in a knowledge working

723
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,359
position

724
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,119
right are worried about putting food

725
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,119
over on the table or a roof over your

726
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,880
head you're probably not even that

727
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,200
worried about i'd like to buy the dan

728
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,800
pink book right you'll just go buy it if

729
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,839
you want it

730
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,119
you have a few pounds to spare

731
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
right

732
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,400
but what really

733
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,319
motivates people is they're inside

734
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,560
motivators they're intrinsic motivators

735
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,920
so when you take money off the table

736
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,800
like you're getting enough

737
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,200
to get the things you want

738
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,160
the intrinsic motivators are autonomy

739
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,599
mastery and purpose

740
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,079
autonomy you want to feel like you're in

741
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,599
charge of your own destiny mastery you

742
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,560
want to feel like you're good at the job

743
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,359
you do

744
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,680
right

745
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,200
and purpose is you want to feel like

746
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,560
what you're doing matters

747
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,640
right i'm not doing something for no

748
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,720
reason

749
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,440
so how do we create a sense of purpose

750
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,839
inside of an organization

751
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,520
we set goals not tasks

752
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,119
right tasks don't have a sense of

753
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,680
purpose they're just a time limited

754
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,680
thing that gets completed

755
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,160
goals give us a sense of purpose what

756
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,520
are we trying to achieve

757
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,440
next

758
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,119
who does it matter to and then the level

759
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,560
of your goal

760
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,240
is going to change the way you look at

761
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,400
that picture depending on the maturity

762
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,319
of your organization

763
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,560
um so i've got three different types of

764
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,440
goals listed here

765
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,200
and i have strategic goals

766
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,200
which might be things like a product

767
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,760
vision or a corporate vision right that

768
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,040
might be your strategic goal

769
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,480
what are you trying to achieve as a

770
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,319
company

771
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,280
but that might be

772
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,280
very

773
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
i guess the british expression is pie in

774
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,640
the sky

775
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,880
what's like something you can't actually

776
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,480
reach out and touch

777
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,960
because it's too far away

778
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,319
so you as an employee

779
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,240
maybe don't

780
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,000
i don't understand how the work i do

781
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,800
today connects to that thing because

782
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,800
it's too far away

783
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,880
so we have something called an

784
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,119
intermediate strategic goal

785
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,000
and an intermediate strategic goal is

786
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,599
far enough out that we've got vision and

787
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,680
forethought and we're looking forward

788
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,520
into the future

789
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,000
but it's close enough that we can still

790
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,920
connect to it we can still see how the

791
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,480
work we do every day connects to that

792
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,480
strategic goal

793
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,520
that's that intermediate

794
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,280
goal

795
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,760
there

796
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,760
and then we also have tactical goals

797
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,760
tactical goals are what are you doing

798
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,960
now what are you doing today

799
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,960
why are you getting up this morning

800
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,240
right in the in the in the scrum world

801
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,559
right this doesn't just apply to the

802
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,920
scrum world but in the scrum world and

803
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,920
we have we have sprint goals

804
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,680
sprint goals are our tactical goal what

805
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,359
are we doing now

806
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,000
to make our next step forward what's our

807
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,000
next step

808
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,200
and then we have

809
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,520
product goals

810
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,400
which are our next waypoint

811
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,480
on the way to our intended destination

812
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,280
and the strategic goal is you know where

813
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,280
are we trying to get to

814
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,960
so that's the purpose of this

815
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,400
the

816
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,440
onion i guess we call it the onion

817
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,319
diagram here because get many layers

818
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,880
but there's the tactical goal and

819
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,720
scrum really only talks about

820
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,319
this bit at the bottom

821
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,480
doesn't talk about all this other stuff

822
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,280
that's that's leadership and

823
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,119
uh

824
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,520
organizational strategy and product

825
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,040
management

826
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,839
scrum doesn't talk about those things

827
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,960
but

828
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,160
you know

829
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,920
we're gonna have a business plan we're

830
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,839
gonna have a product vision we're gonna

831
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,960
have a road map these are things i would

832
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,960
expect companies to have

833
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
for each product

834
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,640
do you have a vision and a road map and

835
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,319
what are you trying to achieve

836
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,359
how do the people working on your

837
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,520
products

838
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,319
connect

839
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,920
to the story

840
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,559
so that they see how their work

841
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,559
contributes

842
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,920
right there's a little definitely a

843
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,599
little bit of an art and a skill

844
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,119
in being able to make those connections

845
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,640
because if people are connected to the

846
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,680
work they do better work

847
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,520
because we

848
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,850
feel like our work matters that we know

849
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,070
how we contribute

850
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:06,070
[Music]

851
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:13,760
but we also need to be able to to

852
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,680
to figure out how we get there

853
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,960
right are we making progress towards

854
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,359
these goals are our goals

855
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,119
the right thing

856
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,359
so let's do a little exercise let's see

857
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,160
how many people have we got now we have

858
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,880
19 people

859
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,559
damn it's an uneven number i was gonna

860
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,559
do pairs let's do threes

861
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,040
oh you're much smarter than me what's 19

862
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,040
divided by three

863
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,599
six point three three three three three

864
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,040
three see i just popped my calculator

865
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,319
that's how i do that so i don't have to

866
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,480
think about it

867
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,079
i'm i'm in a different mode for my my

868
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,520
coding mode

869
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,240
all right so i'm gonna create

870
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,839
six breakout rooms

871
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,839
let's create six recreate

872
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,880
four five six six great rooms and what

873
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,960
i'll do is i'll write you're all gonna

874
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,040
be randomly assigned to the breakout

875
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,839
rooms so i'm sorry if you're in there

876
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,839
with somebody you don't

877
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:15,520
like but what i would like the next one

878
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,880
will be random again so you'll get

879
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,839
somebody else

880
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,280
i'd like to use the first six

881
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,440
rooms there

882
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,960
uh so go to the the hex that matches

883
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,800
your room number at the top um and

884
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
create

885
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,400
a list of things that you're measuring

886
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,000
today

887
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,800
in your organization

888
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,800
what are you measuring

889
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,400
okay

890
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,280
so i just started the breakout rooms

891
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,000
take about 10 seconds to spin up

892
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,599
and then um

893
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,280
have a go at answering that question and

894
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,960
i'll put five minutes on the timer so

895
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,839
you know how long you've got

896
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,839
okay

897
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,800
that last room is still spinning up

898
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,400
victoria that's your room it should be

899
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,640
there it should be started in just a

900
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,640
moment

901
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,839
it's

902
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,520
hmm

903
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,240
for's taking a long time to start i

904
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,160
wonder what's going on

905
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,559
oh you're frozen that means you've gone

906
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,559
awesome

907
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,400
i think everybody's gone

908
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,800
james is unsure

909
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,480
what the heck is wrong with my camera

910
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,760
can i get under the desk and fix it in

911
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,240
five minutes or is that going to be

912
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,680
is that going to be a bad idea

913
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
what do you think

914
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,839
internet

915
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,040
i think it's going to be a bad idea so

916
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,160
i'm going to leave this one on i can

917
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,160
swap to the other camera

918
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,920
my new camera is supposed to be working

919
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,880
better but um

920
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,720
today

921
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,000
it's been working great for the last

922
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,680
five days

923
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,640
but today it's freezing up so something

924
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,240
must be different today on my computer

925
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,760
i don't know what it is what i'll

926
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,599
probably find is i'll just unplug it and

927
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,839
plug it back in oh i can unplug it and

928
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,280
plug it back in because i can unplug it

929
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,760
from here

930
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,760
right unplug it there we go unplugged it

931
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,359
i plugged it back in let's see if that

932
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,720
works

933
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:27,720
i will probably need to reset it

934
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:38,559
oh i double clicked in the wrong thing

935
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,160
deactivate reactivate

936
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,040
let's see if that works because i much

937
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,040
prefer this camera

938
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,640
um

939
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,359
okay so they're

940
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,240
oh we've got some story points

941
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:54,559
we've got some uh

942
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,559
whip

943
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,960
uh what else have we got

944
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,680
i'll just release everybody that's

945
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,680
following me

946
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,200
so

947
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,800
whip velocity

948
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,240
yep story points satisfaction

949
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,559
confidence

950
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,559
i'm gonna grab a link to

951
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,000
my good friend christian's

952
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,000
tool

953
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
uh

954
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,079
they have a tool

955
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,079
where is it

956
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,040
uh teammetrics.liberators.com

957
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,280
let's try that oh that's a participation

958
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,280
link

959
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,520
uh let's not do a participation link

960
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,520
let's do a root link there we go

961
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,720
i'm gonna start here

962
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,040
oh christian

963
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,839
you need to fix this

964
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:12,640
look you've got no default image set for

965
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,440
your team metrics page

966
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,440
that's not good

967
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,800
um

968
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,079
[Music]

969
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,359
but i put it on there

970
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,359
isn't there another

971
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:30,800
at one of these surveys at the

972
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,800
liberators i think there is

973
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,280
origin story built with stakeholders one

974
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,400
let's see workshops

975
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,160
[Music]

976
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,160
oh they have the zombie scrum guide

977
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,160
um i don't see

978
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,079
i don't see

979
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,359
ah

980
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,880
matter liberators are awesome

981
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,240
so we have a lot of things we have about

982
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,319
a minute left

983
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,200
on the timer i know you're all hanging

984
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,200
out here with me

985
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:05,040
um if you're watching online maybe

986
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:09,280
nobody's watching i don't know i can't

987
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:12,480
see so that's just the way it is

988
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,599
um but velocity capacity

989
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,599
resource for budget reports yeah

990
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,200
but cumulative flow burn down as well

991
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,680
sprint report

992
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,040
some good things what's over here

993
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,359
number of points delivered number of

994
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,799
hours in the office oh that's that's uh

995
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,799
where's my skull and crossbones

996
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,240
i'll just type skull and i bet i'll get

997
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,640
her

998
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,359
yeah that's a death

999
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,359
thing there we go

1000
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,559
oh maybe use that one

1001
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,799
there's my oh there's a skull and

1002
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,200
crossbones awesome i'm gonna get one of

1003
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,200
those over

1004
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,760
oh number of hours in the office number

1005
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,520
feature delivers in a sprint

1006
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,280
estimated velocity visa actual oh yuck

1007
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,720
um

1008
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,359
sprint goal velocity budgets up time

1009
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,599
backlog size whip story points velocity

1010
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:11,240
oh wow right so let's close the rooms

1011
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,240
and bring everybody back

1012
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,359
so have a look around

1013
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,000
the wall do a little bit of a a gallery

1014
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:42,960
walk and see what everybody else has has

1015
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,400
put

1016
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,200
um i brought brought in a couple of um

1017
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,160
lovely little little skulls

1018
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,559
um

1019
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,920
to put next to a couple of them

1020
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,440
i i

1021
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,720
number of hours in the office

1022
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,720
that's an awesome metric

1023
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,640
you work in a call center

1024
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,880
i i do uh know of somebody who did work

1025
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,640
at a call center and they got measured

1026
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,359
in the number of minutes they spent on

1027
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,359
potty breaks

1028
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,599
oh yeah

1029
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,640
yeah alex

1030
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,640
when you when you put your your phone

1031
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,520
you have a button to go well you have to

1032
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,240
go off offline so you don't take more

1033
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,880
calls and it asks you why are you going

1034
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,880
offline so i'm going on a toilet break a

1035
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,799
cigarette break or whatever and then

1036
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,559
your manager gets a sheet that says

1037
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:41,359
here's how much time you spent on all

1038
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,680
these other things alex you've spent too

1039
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,880
much time in the toilet today

1040
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:51,720
right that is that is not a conducive

1041
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,720
uh office experience for sure

1042
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,079
this is the thing when when

1043
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,839
when the only thing that mattered was

1044
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,079
our productivity

1045
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:07,119
right because we were screwing the top

1046
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:11,280
on toothpaste tubes or

1047
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,079
whatever the the the packing boxes right

1048
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,240
then

1049
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,319
those are how you measure people right

1050
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,920
because that's money out of your pocket

1051
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,040
as a business

1052
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,480
but in the complex cognitive world

1053
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,680
alex does his best thinking when he's

1054
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,920
sitting down

1055
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,440
doing something else right

1056
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,559
so

1057
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,240
it's not

1058
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:33,440
time away from work it's actually time

1059
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,880
in work

1060
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,119
it's just

1061
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,960
counted differently

1062
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,839
oh there we go number of minutes number

1063
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,599
of minutes in this yeah like this is

1064
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:46,160
where the inspiration happens that's

1065
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,280
where the inspiration happens yeah

1066
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,280
you just hope you can reach a pen

1067
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,520
um so the other one that i would like to

1068
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:59,280
call on again is in room one

1069
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,599
um is estimated velocity v's actual

1070
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,480
velocity

1071
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,920
i just want to to call on that one

1072
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,040
i

1073
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,040
i

1074
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,359
that's that's a heart that's a hard one

1075
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,359
because

1076
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,799
what could have impacted

1077
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,839
a change in velocity

1078
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:19,839
for a team

1079
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,359
a nouns

1080
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,880
unknowns

1081
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,880
what sort what sort of unknowns

1082
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,040
no it's maybe it's that i don't know

1083
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,040
someone is

1084
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,760
um is sick and yep it's what the

1085
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,119
capacity

1086
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,640
i think yeah actual actual velocity is

1087
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:51,359
i'm i think it's the capacity so

1088
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,559
yeah velocity but you can't uh

1089
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:56,720
uh you you take into account um

1090
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,040
the number of workers actual number of

1091
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,359
workers i don't know for

1092
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,680
holidays or something

1093
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:06,319
possibly it is yeah

1094
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,880
absolutely it could be it could be

1095
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:10,480
people off sick it could be you know

1096
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,000
that time of year when everybody gets

1097
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,599
flu because their kids go back to

1098
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,280
kindergarten it could be um

1099
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,760
the the

1100
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,400
something else has has uh is happening

1101
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,280
maybe it's uh what in in different

1102
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,799
countries they have different holidays

1103
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,040
right there could be holiday days that

1104
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,160
week that shorten the sprint it could be

1105
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,480
christmas

1106
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,760
right lots of people have christmas off

1107
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,119
um

1108
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,680
it could be

1109
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:39,520
that we just took on something that we

1110
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,760
thought we took on a piece of work that

1111
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,040
we thought we understood and we find out

1112
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,079
halfway through the sprint that we

1113
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,079
didn't understand it

1114
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,599
but i want

1115
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:53,200
i want to ask what do you mean saying

1116
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,440
estimated velocity because in my uh

1117
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,359
i understand the velocity like something

1118
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,359
uh based on the

1119
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:02,400
historical data

1120
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,319
it's not estimation but you know

1121
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,400
i agree melina

1122
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,119
but quite a lot of

1123
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,520
managers will say to the team

1124
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,079
but but the last few sprints i've

1125
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,319
calculated your average velocity so this

1126
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,000
sprint i want to see no less than 20

1127
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,000
story points

1128
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,040
so this is the the

1129
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,960
expectation yeah it's that expectation

1130
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,559
gap because we're we're then

1131
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,319
constraining on scope again

1132
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,400
right i'm trying to avoid uh

1133
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,079
constraining on scope

1134
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,680
there's lots of rules

1135
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,240
yes sorry um

1136
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
celio

1137
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,880
yeah

1138
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,480
leadership called an all hands meeting

1139
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,839
on wednesday and took everybody in the

1140
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,359
team out for for a half day

1141
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:55,680
announced that we're going to be laying

1142
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,720
off 10 of the workforce and now nobody

1143
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,000
works for the rest of the day because

1144
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,240
they're scared about losing their job

1145
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,400
and thinking about other things

1146
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,039
they're all they're all surfing uh

1147
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,039
job sites

1148
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,720
these things happen

1149
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,640
right

1150
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,960
velocity fluctuating

1151
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,480
is normal it's gonna happen there's

1152
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,880
nothing you can do about it there's

1153
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,039
nothing predictable about it

1154
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,920
velocity as molina was saying is a

1155
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,990
measure of the past not of the future

1156
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,359
it's just a measure of what happened

1157
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:27,039
[Music]

1158
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,760
but there's lots of other things that

1159
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,559
are really good in here like a a cycle

1160
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,359
time

1161
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,359
um number of clients affected

1162
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:39,599
uh there's story points burn down charts

1163
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,920
team velocity definitely very there's

1164
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:44,799
some that are very team focused

1165
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,280
right but there's also satisfaction

1166
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,200
down here in room five

1167
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,960
that could be customer satisfaction or

1168
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,119
it could be employee satisfaction

1169
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,000
couldn't it could be either

1170
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:58,079
what about confidence

1171
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,200
confidence is good how confident are

1172
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:01,200
your customers that you're going to

1173
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,680
deliver

1174
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,079
there's a measure

1175
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:08,799
that's this is also for the team and for

1176
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,640
the customers so also that for how how

1177
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,880
confident the team feels for the next

1178
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,000
spring for example yeah and sometimes

1179
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,000
you see that

1180
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,920
this confidence goes down and that's the

1181
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,160
indicator for something in the team did

1182
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,400
they do the backlog refinement well

1183
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,599
was the information for somebody do we

1184
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,920
need some smes some experts so these

1185
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,440
these are some small indicators

1186
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,520
yeah um

1187
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,160
and just because we've got a high

1188
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,000
confidence doesn't mean we're right

1189
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,839
lots of bad things happen to people who

1190
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,799
have are very confident that they can do

1191
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:41,359
something

1192
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:43,440
like when you're drunk and you know you

1193
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,440
think you can make it just maybe not

1194
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,720
going to happen

1195
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,799
yeah

1196
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:53,599
but there's there's also some things up

1197
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:57,359
a room six at kpis and okrs

1198
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,200
right so key performance indicators

1199
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:02,079
i i think there's more negative

1200
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:05,760
connotation around kpis than okrs

1201
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:08,880
um but lots of okrs are also

1202
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,160
introduced incorrectly as something you

1203
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,599
should achieve

1204
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,880
whereas okrs if you meet 70 of your okr

1205
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,760
that's good

1206
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,480
in in in the definition of okrs

1207
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,839
right so even good measures can be used

1208
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:27,039
badly for sure

1209
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:30,079
this is a this is a good list

1210
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,540
whip limits that's good at all levels

1211
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,720
um

1212
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:34,720
[Music]

1213
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,319
resource for resources for budget

1214
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,920
reports is that people for budget

1215
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:40,480
reports

1216
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,520
i'm just wondering because sometimes

1217
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,000
yeah

1218
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:47,599
sometimes when we say resources we mean

1219
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,400
things and sometimes we mean people

1220
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,520
right

1221
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,400
things

1222
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,400
should perform how we expect them to

1223
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,640
right i want my pencil sharpener to

1224
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,640
sharpen my pencils what happens when my

1225
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,079
pencil sharpener stops sharpening my

1226
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,480
pencils

1227
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,160
i throw it out and i get a new one

1228
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,920
right that's a perfectly reasonable

1229
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,799
attitude or i have to get a new blade or

1230
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,960
whatever i do

1231
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,319
but if a person's underperforming is it

1232
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,000
okay to just throw them out and get a

1233
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,359
new one

1234
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,480
i'm oh

1235
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:21,359
yeah it's nodding there

1236
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,039
alex is appalled no it's not okay

1237
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,200
right there's lots of things they could

1238
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,280
be they could be your

1239
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,160
they could have potential to be your

1240
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,599
best employee

1241
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,160
your best

1242
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:36,880
creator your best innovator

1243
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,400
but some things not right something

1244
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,880
maybe somebody else on their team

1245
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,799
there's friction between team members

1246
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,920
maybe maybe there's something going on

1247
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:47,520
right maybe maybe they work well not

1248
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,280
under pressure

1249
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,440
right

1250
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:53,680
and so you have to figure out as a

1251
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,440
leader how do i create a circumstance

1252
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,319
where i can get the best out of all the

1253
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,079
all the people right other than

1254
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:01,440
what was that alex

1255
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,520
i was just gonna say i like the fact

1256
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,319
that the industry went from

1257
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,920
hr management to people management to

1258
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,079
talent management

1259
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,640
these new terms you know are staying

1260
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,680
away from resources

1261
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,079
well

1262
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:18,160
funny funnily enough i did i did an

1263
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,480
agile training the other day and uh

1264
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:21,520
email went out to all of the prospective

1265
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,200
students

1266
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,920
right so it was a private class inside a

1267
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,880
company and and the email said mandatory

1268
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,799
training at the top and it said and

1269
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,880
instead in the body all resources must

1270
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,920
attend

1271
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,720
right how do you think that makes them

1272
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,039
oh

1273
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,920
all the meat must turn up in the

1274
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,680
yeah yeah it's it's it's

1275
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,720
if you read that as an employee you're

1276
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,640
gonna be like

1277
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,400
bastards you know you're just not going

1278
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,079
to be happy with that doesn't create a

1279
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,039
good outlook

1280
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:53,039
right sometimes

1281
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:57,359
no one couldn't know what they because

1282
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:01,079
no one needs a resource over there so no

1283
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:01,079
one is going to trade

1284
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,240
and even when they go to training they

1285
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,559
want to just sleep in the back and not

1286
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,880
participate because

1287
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:12,839
they were told to be there man mandatory

1288
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:17,119
training is is is mental

1289
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:19,920
um so in order to to

1290
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,680
connect people to goals

1291
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,960
we have to have goals that focus at the

1292
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,400
right level

1293
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,319
right so you get a bunch of metrics

1294
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,799
there some of those metrics are focusing

1295
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:32,480
on output right but for example

1296
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:35,440
uh a

1297
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,720
satisfaction of your customers is

1298
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,720
probably more of an outcome

1299
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,839
than monitoring output

1300
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,240
so the three categories of goals

1301
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:49,200
that i have here are activities

1302
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:51,280
that's things that people do

1303
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,960
right so how many tasks did you deliver

1304
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,200
today benjamin

1305
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,119
right that's i delivered four tasks

1306
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,720
today and five tasks yesterday okay your

1307
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,640
performance is going down benjamin it's

1308
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,039
going down

1309
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,720
right that's that's uh activity but if

1310
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,920
you were screwing the top on toothpaste

1311
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,640
tubes

1312
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,680
i did 30 000 yesterday i did 32 000

1313
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,599
today

1314
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,079
okay well that's that's that's how we

1315
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,640
might measure that

1316
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:20,279
and then output is things that the

1317
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,279
organization produces

1318
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,560
so that's that

1319
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:33,520
i did 30 000 tubes today

1320
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,520
and the outcomes

1321
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,120
things that the customer or users want

1322
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,040
in their product experience the

1323
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,440
different experience that they have with

1324
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,440
the product

1325
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,159
there's one level that i don't have on

1326
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,120
here

1327
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,520
and that's

1328
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,520
impact

1329
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,679
impact is above i should have had these

1330
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,080
the other way up actually let's let's be

1331
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,880
fair i should put these other way up um

1332
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,719
after outcome comes impact

1333
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,279
what impact

1334
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:07,839
are you trying to make in the world

1335
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,839
with your product

1336
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,960
right

1337
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,799
so if you think about companies that

1338
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,040
maybe focus on

1339
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,199
outcomes

1340
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:19,440
um what might be companies that focus on

1341
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:22,159
outcomes uh

1342
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:25,199
i think

1343
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,199
i'm trying to think of a

1344
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,199
like something like tesco's

1345
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,040
supermarket quite often

1346
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:34,080
focuses on the outcome they want their

1347
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,920
customers to have a better experience

1348
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:38,560
when they come to the store but

1349
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,319
sometimes they market it as

1350
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,319
i want more stuff for my money

1351
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,560
right have you seen those marketing for

1352
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,040
supermarkets come to our supermarket and

1353
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,839
you get more stuff for your money

1354
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,159
is that an activity an output an outcome

1355
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,159
or an

1356
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:07,040
it's impact output

1357
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,199
more stuff more things

1358
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:13,000
the organization produces more things

1359
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:13,000
for the same amount of input

1360
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,600
good goals

1361
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,600
have certain characteristics

1362
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,280
uh

1363
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,920
they should be

1364
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,920
ambitious

1365
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,360
right if it's just a mediocre goal

1366
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,320
everybody's like yeah

1367
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,480
right

1368
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,440
how many of your your friends

1369
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,040
uh

1370
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,159
when they were were trying to quit

1371
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,239
smoking

1372
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,640
said i'm gonna i'm gonna reduce the

1373
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,000
number of cigarettes i smoke from 20 a

1374
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,880
day to

1375
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,960
19 a day that's going to be my goal

1376
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:53,199
and you're kind of like that's a bit of

1377
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,930
a rubbish goal

1378
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,239
right that's not very ambitious

1379
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:00,560
[Music]

1380
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:03,520
and it never works i agree

1381
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:06,800
well i know i was a a smoker many years

1382
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,800
ago and that one never works

1383
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,239
zero or one

1384
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,800
i i

1385
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,600
a friend of mine's dad uh once told me

1386
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,239
that

1387
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,760
he'd not had a cigarette in 30 years

1388
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,440
and he said you never really quit

1389
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,040
smoking you just don't have one in a

1390
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,480
really long time

1391
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:28,159
that's that was his uh uh thing so this

1392
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,400
should be ambitious they should be

1393
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:32,000
specific

1394
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,760
what do you want you want to get

1395
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,360
something out of it right something

1396
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,679
concrete

1397
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:39,760
they should be transparent

1398
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,600
right we need to understand it

1399
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,679
the stakeholders need to understand it

1400
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,800
the team need to understand that the

1401
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,719
organization needs to understand it

1402
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,719
and they should be discussed

1403
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,440
all the time

1404
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:55,520
continually revisited is this still the

1405
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,120
right goal to have are we still going in

1406
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,840
the right direction do we need to change

1407
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,840
what we're working on

1408
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,640
even your your your

1409
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,840
product

1410
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,840
your product goal

1411
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,199
that you're going to have in scram you

1412
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,880
should be revisiting it every single

1413
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:17,360
review are we still going in the right

1414
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,360
direction

1415
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,440
your business goals

1416
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,199
right your business plan are we still on

1417
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,239
track to get to our business plan should

1418
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,760
we change our business plan because this

1419
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,840
it will be better if we go a different

1420
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,640
direction

1421
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,640
they're always negotiable

1422
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,560
not negotiable that's the wrong word

1423
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,640
disgust is the right word

1424
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,159
once you have a goal stick to it

1425
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,880
i didn't get halfway to my goal and

1426
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,880
that's good enough

1427
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,640
so get a little card uh sorting exercise

1428
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,960
here oh i didn't even

1429
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,000
that shows me not prepared doesn't it

1430
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,960
let me

1431
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,640
uh

1432
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,880
nope i need to unlock those other cards

1433
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,840
have a look so this little card sorting

1434
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,960
exercise i'm just gonna oh

1435
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,360
well that's gonna be fun

1436
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,360
let me

1437
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,880
how many grips do we need have we got

1438
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:22,640
more people again let's look

1439
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:26,080
i think we got whoa we lost a couple

1440
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:30,239
that's what happens when we get uh

1441
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,239
we cross that one minute over the

1442
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,640
over the hour or the half hour because

1443
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,920
people have other meetings booked or get

1444
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,960
interrupted

1445
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,480
uh so let's do

1446
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,239
i think these are quite hard

1447
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,440
conversations

1448
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:48,000
so

1449
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:52,000
i think we only gonna have four teams

1450
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
okay for four groups

1451
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,400
that's why i have it like this so i can

1452
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:58,960
pick how many groups i'm gonna have

1453
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,960
uh depending on who's here and

1454
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,960
how you feel and how you're getting on

1455
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,719
and also it makes it different every

1456
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,080
time

1457
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,440
uh someone create four rooms

1458
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,440
automatically create it

1459
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,320
okay

1460
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,080
so in

1461
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,280
yes that's four people per room that's

1462
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,360
pretty awesome

1463
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,400
and so in your room there are a number

1464
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,360
of

1465
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,760
oh

1466
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:29,600
that one's get stuck

1467
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,400
can we see that look my goals got stuck

1468
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:34,000
that's not good uh so the easy way to

1469
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,199
unstick it because it's going to be

1470
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,159
every room

1471
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:39,600
is you right cut it and paste it and now

1472
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:42,800
it's unstuck

1473
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,880
okay that's just a mural tip for you so

1474
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,560
if one of them stuck i think that's the

1475
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,800
only oh no see this one on the other

1476
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,040
side stuck as well cut it paste it and

1477
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,920
there you go problem solved

1478
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,280
okay so that'll be a little extra puzzle

1479
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,239
for you to solve when you get into your

1480
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,760
room um what i'd like you to think about

1481
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,920
is

1482
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,640
each of these cards

1483
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:08,000
would it go is it an activity

1484
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,760
right something that is done by people

1485
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,080
is it an output

1486
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,719
something your organization produces or

1487
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:18,159
is it an outcome

1488
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:20,000
something that changes the behavior

1489
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:22,640
of our of our of our users of our

1490
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,679
customers i think i'll bring down these

1491
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,560
uh

1492
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,960
oh

1493
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,960
unlock

1494
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,520
unlock and i'm gonna bring that down

1495
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,560
stick it over here and make it a bit

1496
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,880
smaller

1497
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,239
oh well i made half of it smaller i'll

1498
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,400
fix the rest

1499
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:40,400
um

1500
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,560
just so that we've got those

1501
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,320
words there

1502
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,719
okay i'll fix that while you're in your

1503
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:49,040
breakout rooms so you can um have a look

1504
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,040
as well

1505
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,360
does everybody understand what we're to

1506
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:55,600
do it's just a card sort

1507
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,320
okay cool i'm going to click open

1508
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,280
it'll take about 10 seconds

1509
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,320
um

1510
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:06,440
for the rooms to open

1511
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,440
and i've even fixed

1512
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,679
well mostly fixed

1513
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,400
it's always good fixing things on the

1514
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,400
fly

1515
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:23,040
so

1516
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,040
let's make that shorter there we go

1517
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:34,320
up there we go and then oh

1518
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:36,560
sg did you get kicked out or did you

1519
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,440
just pop back in

1520
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,400
i looked you down you got kicked out

1521
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,400
which room were you in

1522
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,920
so your room two at the top of your

1523
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,000
team's window there should be a button

1524
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,280
that says go to room

1525
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,920
or join room or something

1526
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,920
can you see that

1527
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:04,239
i do have your device setting into full

1528
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,239
screen show background effect

1529
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,800
uh so it's not on the ellipse menu

1530
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,920
it should be just on the the top bar

1531
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,679
next to the leave button

1532
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,400
are you using the web-based teams of the

1533
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,400
desktop app

1534
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:24,800
oh

1535
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,960
oh now now you're out with the bounds of

1536
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,000
my knowledge experience then

1537
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,199
ah

1538
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
let's see so it's

1539
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:36,400
still not realized

1540
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,199
that you're not in the room

1541
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,239
uh so why don't why don't we have a chat

1542
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,840
here

1543
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:44,880
um

1544
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,239
let's go let's go down to there we go i

1545
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,840
bet you it's stuck i know it's not stuck

1546
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:50,320
there okay

1547
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,199
hey you know i'm one of your buddy one

1548
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:55,199
of your phd guys

1549
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:59,199
you thought sorry

1550
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:59,199
i'm one of your scrambled buddy

1551
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:04,080
awesome welcome to be here

1552
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,800
i i

1553
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,840
just opened because it was coming in

1554
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,880
meetups i thought hey let's meet the

1555
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,760
great person today i would not say that

1556
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,920
i'm a great person but uh

1557
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,679
i guess that the

1558
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,000
what i what i've found

1559
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:24,840
uh is that loads of people don't

1560
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,440
understand that training can be fun

1561
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,719
um so

1562
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,920
that's why i'm doing these as live

1563
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,920
events

1564
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,600
because then people can

1565
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,199
watch the recording later and see oh

1566
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,480
that looked like a fun interactive

1567
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:42,960
experience maybe i should go to a class

1568
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:46,320
um that's the idea

1569
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,120
i know you always do amazing job

1570
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,120
so

1571
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:53,120
it's always a great learning

1572
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:54,880
i am just making it up as i go along

1573
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,239
so so

1574
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,840
because

1575
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:00,960
i

1576
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,960
really struggled

1577
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,000
i really struggled to create

1578
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,280
um

1579
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,610
to create this this this session

1580
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,120
um

1581
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:13,199
[Music]

1582
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:16,400
just trying to

1583
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:17,760
get something around agile leadership

1584
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,600
is quite hard and then you don't know

1585
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,360
who's going to turn up

1586
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,040
so if i got a bunch of

1587
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,400
ctos turn up

1588
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,760
right this would be a whole different

1589
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,679
experience

1590
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,840
then it seems like i've got a whole

1591
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:33,679
bunch of people that work on teams that

1592
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:37,920
are perhaps very close to teams

1593
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:39,520
so so it definitely it's how do you

1594
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,520
balance that so i wanted to come up with

1595
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,199
something that might work with both that

1596
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,320
was the idea anyway

1597
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,400
so i got so i i got lots of help jim jim

1598
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:53,520
sammons helped out

1599
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,760
and um uh uh simon randell helped out

1600
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,600
uh so that's uh

1601
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,560
that's good

1602
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:04,320
are you enjoying it so far

1603
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:08,000
of course that's why i'm here right to

1604
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:10,800
learn from everyone to see what what you

1605
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,920
create martin is doing

1606
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,360
well

1607
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,520
you i posted on the the slack group but

1608
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,600
if you want to come to any of my classes

1609
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:23,760
it's free

1610
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,760
i don't i don't charge for psts

1611
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,920
what's the great things about pst

1612
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,960
community specifically the step you have

1613
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,679
taken which is very bold right certainly

1614
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,120
we see we are charging 500 dollars for

1615
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:38,480
xyg

1616
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:41,120
but i really love your approach yeah i'm

1617
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,280
not i'm not paying anything so i'm not

1618
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,719
charging from you cost me anything so

1619
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,639
why should i charge you something that

1620
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,719
doesn't make any sense

1621
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:50,480
that doesn't seem

1622
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,719
yeah i don't know

1623
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,960
so yeah i've been i've been trying out a

1624
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,520
lot of different things recently so i've

1625
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,440
been um i do this thing where

1626
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,040
if you're uh uh

1627
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,960
if you're unemployed

1628
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,600
or underemployed

1629
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,480
um you just paid 300

1630
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:10,320
uh deposit to come to the class and then

1631
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,840
you pay the rest when you've got a job

1632
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,830
so that's quite good

1633
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,159
um i'm doing um

1634
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:18,480
[Music]

1635
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:20,239
uh uh what's it called like refer a

1636
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,480
friend

1637
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:24,560
so if you if you refer a friend not only

1638
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:26,400
do they get a 20 discount but you get a

1639
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,080
20 store credit for every friend you

1640
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,560
refer so if you refer five people you

1641
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:33,199
get a class for free that's kind of

1642
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,719
trying that out see if that works

1643
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,480
i don't think anybody's used that one

1644
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,400
yet but

1645
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,159
i need to connect with you to get all

1646
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,560
these tips

1647
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:44,400
well i have them all uh published on my

1648
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,800

um and i try and post as much in the

1652
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,360
scrum.community on on what i'm trying as

1653
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,520
well

1654
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,600
uh to see if it see if it worked yeah

1655
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,199
because

1656
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,159
anything that makes the whole community

1657
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,800
better

1658
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:06,040
helps us all so

1659
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,040
one second

1660
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,400
i was uh

1661
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:21,199
me me esposa one thing to know when

1662
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,199
when dinner was

1663
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,280
and i hope you're not recording this

1664
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:31,600
part of part of these questions

1665
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:34,320
well it's uh it's going out live

1666
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:37,760
okay looked amazing

1667
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:40,560
well so i always find that i am

1668
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,320
i am i'm a software engineer therefore i

1669
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,840
am pretty lazy

1670
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,800
i like to make my life as easy as

1671
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,760
possible

1672
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:50,639
if i live stream it

1673
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:53,040
i don't have to upload it

1674
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,000
and i don't have to edit it

1675
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,320
yes

1676
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,600
exactly

1677
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:01,199
that saves me a whole bunch of time uh

1678
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,440
later on because then it's it's just a

1679
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,960
little bit more real as well for for

1680
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,199
people that are watching they can always

1681
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,560
skip ahead i have gone on and you know

1682
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:11,840
how um

1683
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,679
youtube can do the the like the chapters

1684
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,280
i have gone on and done chapters for

1685
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,440
each of the exercises for some of them

1686
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,280
so that people can skip and i'll go

1687
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,280
especially on on

1688
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,960
i think we had 20 minutes at the start

1689
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,199
of pending

1690
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,280
um before we started so i'll go chop

1691
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:29,040
that out of the youtube video but you

1692
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,880
can't chop that out of other platforms

1693
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,840
so

1694
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,520
but i'm experimenting with more

1695
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,600
tools yes it's always good doing new

1696
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,520
things and for placing it to the world

1697
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,719
so that people know people learn from

1698
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,960
that

1699
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:45,360
this is this is a hard exercise

1700
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,360
i think

1701
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:51,360
10 minutes is definitely not enough well

1702
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,360
room one's all gung-ho

1703
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,120
yes actually i tried in one of my

1704
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,800
webinar uh something like that no

1705
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:01,760
technically this one

1706
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:05,440
and i added two more things i added

1707
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:07,360
input and impecca also yeah basically

1708
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,440
and that was two months that was two

1709
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,159
months yeah i'm trying to

1710
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,560
so

1711
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:15,280
a couple of these exercises

1712
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,960
i built for the

1713
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,080
ebm

1714
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,560
course

1715
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:22,320
so this is me first time trying them out

1716
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,159
as well that's the other reason i do

1717
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,960
these is i can experiment with some of

1718
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,159
the different exercises and layouts um i

1719
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,040
did the training from the back of the

1720
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,760
room

1721
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,080
uh i finished up that course last week

1722
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,800
uh so i i

1723
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,760
feel like i i learned a lot from that

1724
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,960
um

1725
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,639
and i've been

1726
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,480
trying to apply it i don't know if you

1727
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,480
saw but my headings were

1728
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,320
connections concepts concrete practices

1729
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:49,040
and conclusions at the top so i'm just

1730
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,639
trying it out seeing how i get on

1731
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,960
um but also

1732
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:56,320
i'm starting the orsk

1733
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,280
training in a couple months doing the

1734
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,960
organized

1735
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,800
organizational systems thinking thing

1736
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,480
with scrum the dark

1737
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,440
yeah yeah

1738
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,920
um see where that goes as well i don't

1739
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:10,880
know it's always fun to learn new things

1740
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,840
because there are a lot of learning

1741
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,840
really

1742
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:20,320
practices over there so i'm sure that

1743
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,560
it's going to be amazing

1744
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,560
yeah

1745
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,120
i just noticed i got a new button in

1746
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,480
teams

1747
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:32,000
since this morning when i ran a

1748
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,880
different workshop they've updated teams

1749
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,880
so

1750
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,400
that's always fun

1751
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,800
and then what's now

1752
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,960
you are you are a team guy basically

1753
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,960
right

1754
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,199
i use teams for all of my workshops and

1755
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,719
all of my training i

1756
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:49,040
i don't think i've ever i've

1757
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,880
participated in training with zoom i've

1758
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,960
never run a training with zoom

1759
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,800
um but i have tried to run a training

1760
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,960
with webex

1761
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,199
that we switched to zoom within the

1762
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,280
first couple of hours i sorry switched

1763
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:03,360
to teams within the first couple of

1764
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,199
hours because um it didn't work out very

1765
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,560
well

1766
01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:08,480
does it let you

1767
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,719
know in my organization

1768
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:13,280
and sorry it was

1769
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:16,080
i i'm using webex load in my

1770
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,360
organization and it worked quite fine

1771
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,679
but

1772
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,719
before fuel is i will say it was better

1773
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,639
than now

1774
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,600
that's what i will say now it has become

1775
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:28,560
very heavy resource serving

1776
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,239
and teams fluctuates as well but i think

1777
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,239
they all do because they try and add new

1778
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,679
features and then it adds more load so

1779
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:36,480
then they have to go

1780
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:38,880
fix the features and and this account is

1781
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:40,639
in the technology advisory group for

1782
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,800
microsoft

1783
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,800
so

1784
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,600
i'm using i'm well yeah windows 11

1785
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
as well as uh at teams insider preview

1786
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,960
as well

1787
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,960

1788
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,159

1827
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,440

1831
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:04,719

1836
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:15,600
[Music]

1837
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,600
that's a

1838
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:21,600
i so that

1839
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:25,600
the the the me only comes from portland

1840
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:28,560
it's like thirty dollars but delivery to

1841
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:31,679
the uk because you know we did stupid

1842
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:34,560
stuff the last couple of years um

1843
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,560
was like forty dollars it cost more for

1844
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,159
the delivery

1845
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,520
it was totally worth it yeah yeah it's

1846
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,320
one of the best pieces of kit i've

1847
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,840
bought

1848
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,719
um

1849
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:46,080
so useful so useful

1850
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,400
so you're not running it over your

1851
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,920
stream

1852
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,760
so

1853
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,960
i've got the stream deck here but it

1854
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,800
doesn't

1855
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,360
it doesn't draw your attention like this

1856
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,600
it's like a big hockey puck that glows

1857
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:02,000
green when you're not a mutant glows

1858
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:04,400
flashes red when you're on mute so it's

1859
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,719
very easy for me to when i'm looking at

1860
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:09,120
you i can see the green glow

1861
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,280
so i know that i'm not on mute it really

1862
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,120
helps really does help

1863
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,960
you can all see your green glow in your

1864
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:17,120
glasses well that's that's because

1865
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,239
that's the screen reflecting in my blue

1866
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,480
light

1867
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:22,000
uh lenses yeah i need to figure out how

1868
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,679
to fix that i maybe just need more

1869
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,040
expensive glasses that could be the

1870
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:26,960
thing

1871
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:29,679
so we need to have the word

1872
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,679
in there as well

1873
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,440
johnny memonic

1874
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,480
no that was a that reference went over

1875
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,480
everybody's head never mind

1876
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,520
except for ove he found it funny there

1877
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,080

uh

1882
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,840
how did you get on

1883
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,120
in that exercise

1884
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,520
mostly confused but we had some

1885
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,239
leaderships

1886
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,760
not everything was like we are totally

1887
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:05,600
sure about

1888
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,880
where to assign it

1889
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,920
i

1890
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,960
i believe that some of these things

1891
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,880
depending on how you look at it

1892
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,880
how you think about measuring it could

1893
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,400
be in one of two categories for sure

1894
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,960
there's definitely things that i would

1895
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,360
say are on the line

1896
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,360
um

1897
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,120
what were the things that you found most

1898
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,400
contentious

1899
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:35,280
uh

1900
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,280
obtain government ev certification

1901
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,199
yeah we weren't sure if it's an activity

1902
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,320
or

1903
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,400
what's the

1904
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,760
what would be the difference if we use

1905
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:47,120
not obtain but obtained

1906
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,639
word

1907
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,440
okay

1908
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:53,120
yeah i would i definitely would wouldn't

1909
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:55,760
i wouldn't want to get that that

1910
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:58,239
semantic every single group put it in

1911
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,960
activity

1912
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:04,800
so i definitely think it it i i think

1913
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,400
it's a an activity something we're doing

1914
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,679
but yeah you're right it could say

1915
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,040
obtaining

1916
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,600
yeah

1917
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:13,600
and even for at least for me as a

1918
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,639
non-english

1919
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,159
obtained i it for me it's two you can

1920
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,120
use them in both

1921
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:22,719
scenarios you have obtained it and

1922
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,040
you're obtaining it

1923
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,040
yes

1924
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:30,480
right right

1925
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:31,520
it could be a goal or it can be a result

1926
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,840
yeah

1927
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,760
yeah yeah so if you've obtained it and

1928
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,440
you have the certificate then maybe it

1929
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,040
feels a little bit more like an output

1930
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,639
yeah yeah

1931
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,239
yeah that's in

1932
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:45,360
in my head it's uh

1933
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:47,600
the duality of that word

1934
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:50,159
at least in how i interpret it in

1935
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,880
english is i can i can you i can use

1936
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:55,199
that in both sentences based on if i'm

1937
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:58,159
doing it or if i got it

1938
01:32:55,199 --> 01:33:02,080
so that is an interesting point of

1939
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:02,080
does the language of your goal matter

1940
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,480
all right

1941
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:12,000
the language that is used in your goal

1942
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:13,600
the words that you use the choice

1943
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,960
it's going to matter

1944
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,320
if if maybe obtain government ev

1945
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,360
certification

1946
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:23,280
is fine if you've got a team in the u.s

1947
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:25,199
or in the uk but if you have a

1948
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:27,280
multinational team with people with

1949
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,560
different languages maybe

1950
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,920
that's not a good word because it's

1951
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,679
ambiguous

1952
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,840
or maybe it just needs explained right

1953
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,880
what do we mean in this case okay now we

1954
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,679
get it

1955
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,199
right but anytime it's ambiguous a new

1956
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,360
person is going to be confused aren't

1957
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,360
they

1958
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,440
yeah so maybe it could have been worded

1959
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:45,440
better

1960
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:54,400
i really like the achieve 90 fun rating

1961
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:57,360
on driver experience

1962
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,360
driving should be fun

1963
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:05,800
increase roi by 12 percent

1964
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:05,800
is that an outcome or an output

1965
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,040
isn't that an outcome

1966
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,480
um but

1967
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,360
yeah it's confusing because because

1968
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:21,040
we've got them the number here so

1969
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,159
maybe it's it's like something like

1970
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,760
product because it's it's just

1971
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:27,280
a certain number

1972
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,320
so

1973
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,320
like i don't know

1974
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:36,320
so the achieved 90 fund rating and

1975
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:38,000
driver experience

1976
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,600
is about

1977
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,840
the customer

1978
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,239
it's something that the customer

1979
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,239
gets

1980
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,560
right

1981
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:51,360
increasing roi by 12 is not something

1982
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:53,040
that happens to your customers

1983
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,560
that's definitely

1984
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:57,040
something that the organization the

1985
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,840
organization produces more money

1986
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:02,000
based on the

1987
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:04,560
investment does that make sense

1988
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,040
so probably probably slip that one over

1989
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,040
the line

1990
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,639
um

1991
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:13,119
[Music]

1992
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,119
reduce company carbon footprint that

1993
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:16,960
sounds like a that's a that sounds like

1994
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:19,040
a outcome

1995
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,440
something we achieve something that

1996
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,639
impacts our customers or makes them want

1997
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,639
to buy us because we do it

1998
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:33,360
but things can go in more than one

1999
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:35,520
category shaping your goals

2000
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:37,040
is actually quite difficult

2001
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,639
right these are goals that somebody else

2002
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:42,000
shaped and we're struggling

2003
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:44,800
which which category do they go into

2004
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,800
the words matter

2005
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,440
them being

2006
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,570
specific

2007
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,760
and understandable

2008
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:55,239
[Music]

2009
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,239
is really important

2010
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:06,400
where are we for for uh

2011
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,080
well

2012
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,560
we are

2013
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,719
we have what seven minutes left i know i

2014
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,639
always go over peter i know i always go

2015
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,320
over i'm i'm one of those folks that

2016
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,560
can't keep to a time box i should really

2017
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:22,159
learn something like scrum or something

2018
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,760
that would probably help um but uh

2019
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:26,800
i i don't know i have when i'm having

2020
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,719
fun i don't like time boxes

2021
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:31,119
right and i'm always having fun so i did

2022
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,159
have a an exercise for you here i don't

2023
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,560
think we're not gonna do it because it's

2024
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:36,960
gonna it's gonna take too long um but

2025
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,560
what we can talk about is the outcome

2026
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:41,920
right the bit that i have on the right

2027
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:44,880
which is uh what to what to look at

2028
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,880
um so in

2029
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,440
in

2030
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:55,600
who's heard of something called

2031
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,600
evidenced based management

2032
01:36:55,679 --> 01:37:01,199
it is not a software term although it's

2033
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:03,920
kind of been co-opted into software

2034
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:06,000
evidence-based management was something

2035
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,400
that started to be talked about about

2036
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,560
100 years ago

2037
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:12,400
and it was when

2038
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,400
doctors

2039
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,360
medical professionals

2040
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,679
decided it was a good idea

2041
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:21,760
to base their decisions about your

2042
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,360
health

2043
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,840
on data

2044
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:29,040
rather than guessing

2045
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,040
and gut feel

2046
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,960
do we do we feel that was a good idea

2047
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:38,880
this this is the reason

2048
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,560
every time you go to your doctors

2049
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,159
what do they do every time you go to

2050
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,320
your doctors

2051
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:46,719
they take your pulse

2052
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,239
they take your pressure

2053
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:50,639
they measure something they measure

2054
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:52,719
something and they put it in the data

2055
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,920
because

2056
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:57,840
just your your your your rate being a

2057
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,320
particular level doesn't tell them

2058
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,400
anything they have to see it trending

2059
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:04,320
over time and if you go to the same

2060
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:05,520
doctor over many years

2061
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,360
they'll see

2062
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,679
that trend of

2063
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:12,719
oh that it's substantially lower today

2064
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:14,639
than it was the last time

2065
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,840
i measured you therefore there might be

2066
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,840
some reason for it

2067
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:24,719
data is important in making decisions

2068
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,719
so what data should we gather

2069
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:31,679
if we just look at one metric

2070
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:33,119
we might make the wrong decisions

2071
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:36,159
because we're just looking at one thing

2072
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:36,159
there's no balance

2073
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,239
so here i've got something called the

2074
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,400
the evidence-based management from

2075
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:49,040
scrum.org

2076
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:51,920
right ebm

2077
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:53,920
and ebm talks about these four

2078
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:56,080
value areas and i'm definitely going to

2079
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,480
caveat this for depends on how you build

2080
01:38:56,080 --> 01:39:01,199
products okay

2081
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:03,440
so the the top half there

2082
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:05,840
is market value

2083
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:07,840
that's your product owner's world

2084
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,719
so if you're thinking about your product

2085
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,400
or your organization

2086
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:14,400
you want to measure

2087
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,679
these two areas

2088
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,639
what value do we currently have

2089
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:22,239
in our

2090
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,239
organization or in our product

2091
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:25,600
right

2092
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,000
so the goal there

2093
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:31,199
is to maximize the value that the

2094
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,199
organization delivers

2095
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:35,840
right just now what are we delivering

2096
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,840
just now

2097
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,760
and then you might ask some questions

2098
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,199
how happy are the customers how happy

2099
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,639
the employees

2100
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:46,639
how happy are your investors

2101
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:51,840
all right it's about your current

2102
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,840
product

2103
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:57,119
and we can them yes

2104
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,080
no when you are talking about these

2105
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,639
things

2106
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:03,360
i think that the the first column in

2107
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:06,960
outcome should go go to goes to the

2108
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:10,080
output i know i can explain it

2109
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,760
good but it's not something that

2110
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:14,000
makes the company

2111
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,600
more attractive to the customers let's

2112
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,320
say something like that that's my

2113
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,320
explanation

2114
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:24,560
but you're

2115
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:27,040
the the items of value

2116
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,840
in your product might be the result of

2117
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,960
of driving towards goals

2118
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,960
right

2119
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,400
so the goal might be

2120
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,920
um

2121
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,280
uh what was one of the other goals we

2122
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,080
had

2123
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:43,520
i can't remember now because my my my

2124
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,440
brain has moved on from there um but uh

2125
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,520
that understanding

2126
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,440
what the current state

2127
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:53,360
of our current value

2128
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:56,400
is going to help us when we create goals

2129
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:57,679
goals change behaviors

2130
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:00,560
the data

2131
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:02,800
measures things that we can measure

2132
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:06,159
and hopefully we can see how those goals

2133
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,840
affect those measures

2134
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:10,880
right but if we don't have any measures

2135
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,800
how do we know our goals are successful

2136
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,719
how do we know where we're we're making

2137
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,719
changes in the way we do things that

2138
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:20,800
have a positive impact on our product in

2139
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,800
our organization unless we measure

2140
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:27,199
and this is not necessarily just at a

2141
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,199
team level it's at a product level

2142
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:33,679
which i guess might be the same as team

2143
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,800
but also might be a lot bigger

2144
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:38,639
right so we need to understand our

2145
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,320
current value and our unrealized value

2146
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,719
right our unrealized value is what's

2147
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:44,639
sitting there in our product backlog

2148
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,840
stuff we haven't built yet that we could

2149
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,840
get value from

2150
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,920
right how would you measure that

2151
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:57,360
what metrics could you come up with

2152
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,880
within the context of your organization

2153
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,840
to understand

2154
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,840
the unrealized value

2155
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:09,119
right

2156
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:11,040
so those two measures are are about the

2157
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:14,760
market they're about business they're

2158
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,760
about product management

2159
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:20,320
the bottom

2160
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,960
two measures

2161
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:25,760
it says organizational capability but

2162
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:28,480
since i'm an engineer

2163
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:31,840
right that's the bit that's 100

2164
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,840
within the control of your team

2165
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,920
all right the market value is we have

2166
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,840
ideas we do experiments we need to see

2167
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,239
if they work

2168
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,080
the bid at the bottom all right that's a

2169
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,880
little bit more

2170
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,880
fundamental

2171
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:51,040
do we have an ability to innovate

2172
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,920
right are we able to create new things

2173
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,320
are we stuck struggling with existing

2174
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,320
things

2175
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,000
that's our ability to innovate

2176
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,560
what might we

2177
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:07,199
we ask

2178
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,800
in our ability intimate innovate what

2179
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:11,040
prevents the organization from

2180
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:14,480
delivering new value

2181
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:16,080
what prevents customers or users

2182
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:17,520
from benefiting from that innovation

2183
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,119
because just because we make new stuff

2184
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,199
doesn't mean customers are using it does

2185
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,880
it

2186
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:25,040
maybe they don't know it's there maybe

2187
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,440
they can't find it maybe it doesn't work

2188
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,440
for them

2189
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:34,239
so there are some concrete measures

2190
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:35,760
that i might use an ability to innovate

2191
01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:38,639
i might look at

2192
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:40,239
my cycle time or my lead time

2193
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,840
right how quickly can i get stuff in

2194
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:43,199
front of

2195
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,480
customers and find out we're building

2196
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:48,080
new things well part of that is time to

2197
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:48,080
market so that's my brain again

2198
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,400
uh what percentage of our time do we

2199
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:53,840
spend on capital expenditure versus

2200
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,320
operational expenditure that's the one i

2201
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,320
was thinking of

2202
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,679
what other

2203
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:06,000
measures could you use inside of your

2204
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:09,199
organization

2205
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,199
monitor innovation

2206
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:14,639
are you innovating are you not

2207
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,639
innovating

2208
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,679
what can you do about it

2209
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,280
find the things that are inhibiting your

2210
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,639
ability to innovate and then there's

2211
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:24,719
time to market

2212
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:26,719
which is how quickly can you get the

2213
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,159
ideas in front of customers

2214
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,320
cycle time

2215
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:32,400
is generally referred to as how quickly

2216
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:34,159
from when the the the people doing the

2217
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,360
work start working on it to it's

2218
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:37,360
delivered

2219
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,639
lead time tends to be from when you have

2220
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:41,600
the idea

2221
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,600
to when it's delivered

2222
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:48,719
right but also what about the amount of

2223
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:51,199
time from when the developers the people

2224
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,480
doing the work are finished

2225
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,960
till you get it in the hands of your

2226
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,960
customers

2227
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:59,600
right

2228
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,239
if we're building software maybe that's

2229
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,679
our devops pipeline right how quickly

2230
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:06,159
can we push our product out to our

2231
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,159
customers

2232
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,119
what cost what what

2233
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:14,159
what makes organizations successful in

2234
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:16,000
that space automation

2235
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:17,760
right how much automation do we have the

2236
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,679
level of quality because we can't have

2237
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,280
high time to market if our quality sucks

2238
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,440
can we

2239
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:25,360
we need to have lots of manual checks in

2240
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:27,199
between us building something and it

2241
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:30,920
getting to the customer if we have a

2242
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:30,920
high defect rate

2243
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,639
somebody checking those things

2244
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:42,480
so it's really important

2245
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:45,040
to have data to look at to make

2246
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:48,239
decisions

2247
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,760
about data but motivate

2248
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:52,800
people and connect them to your

2249
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,800
objectives through goals

2250
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:59,360
so watch out the thing to watch out for

2251
01:45:57,119 --> 01:46:01,199
is bad metrics i'm going to use an

2252
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:04,159
example of a bad metric this is all

2253
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:05,440
sorts of bad metrics here's a bad metric

2254
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:08,159
and it comes from a little company

2255
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:11,440
called microsoft

2256
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:14,320
and they used to have a metric

2257
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:17,040
where every manager

2258
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:18,880
in the organization had to stack rank

2259
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,400
every one of their direct reports and

2260
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,520
the bottom twenty percent was out the

2261
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,040
team

2262
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,320
if you're in the bottom twenty percent

2263
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:27,280
three times in a row you're out the

2264
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:31,280
company

2265
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,280
how would that make you feel hannah

2266
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:37,360
very bad

2267
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,280
i'm not sure

2268
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:41,280
i want to proceed there

2269
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,920
what you you

2270
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,920
motivation

2271
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,639
so

2272
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:52,639
the motivation the mo the motivation

2273
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:55,520
that did in fact happen which is why

2274
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:56,960
they no longer have this policy

2275
01:46:55,520 --> 01:47:00,239
was that

2276
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:01,920
many so it's definitely a sales minded

2277
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:03,119
motivation

2278
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:05,280
right

2279
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:06,800
um but what actually happened was when

2280
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,560
you have a lot of engineers working

2281
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,639
together

2282
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,800
and they feel like

2283
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,719
even if it's not true but if they feel

2284
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,719
like they're going to be in the bottom

2285
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:19,040
20

2286
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,280
they don't feel like they can get above

2287
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,280
that

2288
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,360
maybe i can sabotage one of my

2289
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,760
colleagues

2290
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,520
in order to get ahead

2291
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,520
and that is what was happening inside of

2292
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,280
microsoft

2293
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,360
people were stabbing their teammates in

2294
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,600
the back in order to not be in the

2295
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:40,400
bottom 20

2296
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,840
the other side of that is somebody like

2297
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,719
scott guthrie

2298
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:47,840
in microsoft who's was the head of azure

2299
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:50,960
he had an absolute rock star

2300
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,440
team that he'd put together every member

2301
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,199
of his team

2302
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:58,239
outperformed everybody else in the

2303
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:59,600
organization easily right absolute rock

2304
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:01,760
stars

2305
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:05,840
and at the end of every year

2306
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,840
he has to lose 20 percent of his team

2307
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,040
if you're a manager trying to build an

2308
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:14,880
effective team

2309
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,880
how would that arbitrary metric

2310
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:20,159
help you

2311
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,520
martin there's just one point of view

2312
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:24,639
here

2313
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,119
what did other bear out if an employee

2314
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,639
poured in low 20 percent for

2315
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:30,159
continuously

2316
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:33,760
three year

2317
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:35,679
what manager was doing to improve him

2318
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,520
i believe he should find the manager in

2319
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:40,560
that case right

2320
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:43,119
because managers are there to ensure

2321
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:46,639
people that yep was he

2322
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:50,159
was he creating environment for them no

2323
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:52,800
if i'm the microsoft director

2324
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:56,159
so the problem was that the manager was

2325
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:58,400
looking at the five other managers that

2326
01:48:56,159 --> 01:49:00,800
also reported to the same manager he had

2327
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:03,760
to report to and was more worried about

2328
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:06,320
not being in the bottom 20 themselves

2329
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,000
right so um

2330
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,760
one of one of that was one of the big

2331
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,560
changes that was made as part of the

2332
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:15,280
transition towards satya when satya came

2333
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:18,320
on board at microsoft again yeah yeah um

2334
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:19,760
if if you want lots of juicy

2335
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,199
information on that you should read

2336
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,840
satya's book

2337
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:26,239
hit refresh it has some awesome insight

2338
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,080
in there on the changes in culture and

2339
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:30,239
things that had to be made because of

2340
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:32,320
things that have happened over the years

2341
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:34,080
um i i

2342
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,320
i think the person who's in charge of a

2343
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,880
company should understand what it is

2344
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:40,960
that company is doing and microsoft is

2345
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,119
ultimately an engineering company

2346
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:46,080
they're building uh

2347
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:48,560
products using software development um

2348
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:51,280
so it's is i'm glad i for one am glad

2349
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:54,960
that satya is in charge um

2350
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,960
and not the other guy

2351
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:59,520
well i think we're we're at seven

2352
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:02,080
minutes over that's that's that's pretty

2353
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,840
pretty easy over i think isn't it peter

2354
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,520
we're usually like 30 minutes over so

2355
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,520
that's quite good for this time

2356
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:09,599
um

2357
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:12,159
continuous improvement

2358
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:13,920
yes i'm getting better at time boxing

2359
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,520
right i'm definitely getting better at

2360
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,679
time boxing i've been doing it in my

2361
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,719
classes i have timers i've been setting

2362
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:23,440
them and yeah i'm getting better at that

2363
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:25,760
what i would love is uh for those of you

2364
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:27,040
that came along provide some some

2365
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:29,840
feedback

2366
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:31,679
um what worked well

2367
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,480
right the things that you want me to

2368
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:37,119
keep doing and keep what needs to change

2369
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:39,040
uh peter you were there for the disaster

2370
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,840
that was the lean

2371
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,520
uh

2372
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:43,199
session where the time box was

2373
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,599
completely blown i think we did a two

2374
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:46,560
hour session that time it was ridiculous

2375
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:47,760
um

2376
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,280
and the the

2377
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,440
the thing that needed to change then was

2378
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,560
the time keeping so i hope i've done a

2379
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:54,800
better job

2380
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:57,280
and new ideas to try

2381
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,760
if there's something that you think uh

2382
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,000
you want even if it's different sessions

2383
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,840
right because i've usually

2384
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,520
i've usually by this point come up with

2385
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,960
an idea what i want to do next but i

2386
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,639
don't have an idea what i want to do

2387
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,800
next in two weeks

2388
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,800
uh so i'm gonna have to think about that

2389
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,800
so any ideas you have here will

2390
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,119
influence

2391
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:20,159
that out that outcome

2392
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:21,920
um and then

2393
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:23,280
unanswered questions

2394
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:25,040
on the topic

2395
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,599
that you thought you were going to get

2396
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:29,599
answered but you didn't get answered

2397
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:32,320
because maybe that's a session in its

2398
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:32,320
own in itself

2399
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,920
oh intro to design thinking i think i

2400
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:39,679
need one of those first

2401
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,239
i wouldn't say i'm a design thinking

2402
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,239
expert

2403
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:49,159
lean startup

2404
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,159
i have read book

2405
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:59,280
yes i like the the way the exercises run

2406
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,040
as well and i've added um they've

2407
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,639
definitely changed a lot even over the

2408
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:06,480
last three months

2409
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,480
um in the way i i do that

2410
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,480
oh oh you copied it

2411
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:18,320
so

2412
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:18,320

is

2415
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,800
in the

2416
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:29,520
community site

2417
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,400
if you open up the events

2418
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,639
tab

2419
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:34,639

on the left if the meeting started right

2421
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,040
and it'll have a little countdown if

2422
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,280
it's not

2423
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:41,599
you can click on it open up the meeting

2424
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:43,599
and then it has a link in the meeting to

2425
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:45,599
join the webinar it says either meeting

2426
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:47,360

yeah i i

2431
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:55,840
i agree it could be more

this is the that this is the best tool

2437
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:17,920
i've tried so far for doing this peter

2438
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,920
might agree he's he's been through my my

2439
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,159
learning experience of sending out

2440
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,320
invitations for these types of things

2441
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:27,520
um and i think this was working the best

2442
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:28,639
so far

2443
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,320
although there's still quite a few

2444
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,320
people there like i can't find the link

2445
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,199
that's okay we'll figure it out it's a

2446
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:37,199
learning opportunity

2447
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,920
yeah

2448
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:44,000
you're you're right as well i didn't put

2449
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,520
the mural link in the in the in the

2450
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,960
comment early enough

2451
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,719
that's because i only finished building

2452
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,480
it this morning that's that's why the

2453
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,480
mural linked if i finished building it

2454
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:54,960
yesterday i might have added it

2455
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,280
um

2456
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,280
yes

2457
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:07,280
i added it after we started

2458
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:09,520
so so i cheated and changed it yeah

2459
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,719
i cheated and changed it

2460
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:15,440
um but there's one thing for

2461
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:17,520
i i was again maybe

2462
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,679
in the invite or press maybe in the

2463
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:22,560
community and the link is not visible

2464
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:24,719
for maybe so you have to press going

2465
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:26,400
oh it might not be obvious

2466
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,159
you need to you need to stop clicking

2467
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,599
maybe of because you had that problem

2468
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:31,599
last time as well

2469
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:34,080
yeah you know she just just never knew

2470
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:37,679
how to fix it by press going

2471
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:39,360
if only i could remove the maybe part

2472
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,480
and it's either you're not going or

2473
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:43,440
you're going

2474
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:46,639
that's what i would prefer

2475
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:46,639
but yes it is it is

2476
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:51,599
i i uh do not build the tool i buy the

2477
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:53,520
tool

2478
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:55,040
so sometimes i have to deal with the

2479
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,800
idiosyncrasies

2480
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:58,960
like i have to go manually create all

2481
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:02,400
the teams links for it which

2482
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:04,800
um is sometimes a bit of a struggle

2483
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:07,760
oh well i'm glad that the the microsoft

2484
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:09,599
rooms are the team rooms breakout rooms

2485
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,679
are working better we definitely

2486
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:14,000
struggled the first few times

2487
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,239
i sent a bunch of feedback to the team

2488
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,960
that owns it and they've definitely

2489
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:22,639
improved it definitely lots of lots of

2490
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,639
improvement is good much more stable

2491
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:27,280
um

2492
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:28,239
more about ebm

2493
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,560
yeah

2494
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:30,560
so i

2495
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,960
i was i was i was i i don't like to make

2496
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:40,000
it uh uh a marketing thing um but i have

2497
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:43,280

time teaching that class i think it'll

2501
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:52,320
be fun

2502
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:54,719

i've got lots of feedback

2580
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:57,679
to deal with yep ux and scrum that is a

2581
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:00,000
dangerous one because i know some folks

2582
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:01,760
that will jump on me for that okay ours

2583
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,560
and scrum uh there's a good video on the

2584
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:08,239
scrum the dog website about okrs um they

2585
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:09,679
did a session recently on okrs uh

2586
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:12,080
how do we know scrum is working or

2587
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:13,920
failing yeah that'd be a good one

2588
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:16,480
uh outside of it

2589
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,320
i taught police officers in ghana

2590
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:19,920
that was a lot of fun

2591
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:22,960
um

2592
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,560
one of one of my most fun uh

2593
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,239
gigs i ever had

2594
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,639
uh scrum at scale

2595
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:31,440
opinions about safe don't get me started

2596
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:33,360
about safe we can talk about that all

2597
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:36,000
day and maybe some nexus

2598
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:39,000
stuff yeah yeah these are all all good

2599
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
ideas
