00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,160
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:11,080
apocalypse is famine and in our context

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,879
of scrum that famine manifests as a lack

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,359
of feedback a lack of Engagement with

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:19,080
stakeholders perhaps even a lack of

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,359
Engagement with your product owner um

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,599
and that famine results in a lack of

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,560
care and attention if the business

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:33,119
doesn't care to turn up and provide

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,119
feedback why should your team care
