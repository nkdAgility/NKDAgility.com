1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
that could be you know when dealing with

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,160
bug reports or it could be just with

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,720
engaging with them and talking to them

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,519
about the problems that they're

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,559
encountering and trying to solve within

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,200
our within our product domain um and we

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,800
want to be benevolent we want to be seen

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,640
as we're providing them with something

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:26,039
that helps enable them to do something

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,080
else if they see our product as a burden

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,800
or they see our product as um I don't

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,399
know what the what's the cost version of

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,680
Burden for me burden's Broad and then

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,079
there's a cost like a cost center if

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,600
they see your product as a cost center

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,399
then um they're they're not going to

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,199
think of your product with kindness um

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
and you're probably not thinking of them

19
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,039
with kindness
