1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,980
so the question

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,840
is how does the PSU course help teams

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,280
make more effective product development

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,560
decisions

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,740
and I think

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,619
the main

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:25,740
value take away from the PSU

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,900
is is this hypothesis driven driven

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,720
approach to software engineering right

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,980
to product development hypothesis

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,899
doesn't approach to product development

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,020
that that

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,180
in order to know that you want to add

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,460
something to the product you need to

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,320
have a reason for it to be there and

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,480
because Bob and accounting asked for it

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,160
is not necessarily a good reason to add

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,200
it to the product right it might be the

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,600
right thing for Bob but what about the

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,180
300 other people that use your product

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,120
is it the right thing for them and Bob

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,660
might be quite important but if Bob's

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,280
happy and he's important but 299 people

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,199
are unhappy with the feature you've

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,600
created then perhaps you're going to

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,540
have a very negative impression build up

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,799
slowly over time that overrides Bob and

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,320
then the customer stops using your

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,000
product right that's that that bounce so

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,000
having

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,460
um creating hypotheses right why are you

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,080
adding this feature to the product what

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,060
value is it going to bring to the

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,759
business and how are you going to

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,580
measure that you've been successful in

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,680
the changes that you make and then even

37
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,380
once you've got all of that figuring out

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,439
what's the smallest experiment we could

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,200
run to start validating that hypothesis

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,460
right so that's that's effectively what

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,680
you should build first you should be

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,240
running lots of little experiments for

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,100
these different little features and

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,320
capabilities that you might add to the

45
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,939
product in the future right you might

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,100
add the full thing to the product but we

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,320
need to run lots of little experiments

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,060
to figure out what are the things that

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,399
should go on to the main part of the

50
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,560
backlog that were actually

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,240
delivering right that's that delivery

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,280
channel to customers this is this

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,320
Discovery Channel this design channel

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,539
are we figuring out what it is we're

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,599
creating and the whole team works

56
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:17,280
together on that the whole team is part

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,440
of that team that helps uh uh facilitate

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,160
that and I think that that for me is the

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,599
big value proposition of the PSU but it

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,959
has a kind of additional side

61
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,560
proposition in that

62
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,020
um quite often the the the the the

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,480
design the design team like the

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,060
designers are separate from the

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,040
engineers and the designers go design

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,420
stuff and and kind of hand it over to

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
the engineers and then the engineers go

68
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,840
build it

69
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,360
and trying to figure out how do we bring

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,060
that together right I mean you can't you

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,260
can't expect everybody in your in your

72
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,599
scrum team

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,519
um to be a ux designer that doesn't make

74
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,739
any sense you've you've got to study

75
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,599
you're just like you can't expect

76
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,420
everybody on your team to be a coder

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,940
right you've got to study your Craft

78
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,700
um you've got to you got to become good

79
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,319
at your craft and then you're able to

80
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,480
provide value and make the right choices

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,940
and and help with the team so you're

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,879
always going to need those expert level

83
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,280
skills for these particular skills but

84
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,620
there are also lots of things that

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,800
everybody on the team needs to

86
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,319
understand about design

87
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,819
so that they don't what's the what's a

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,560
good expression they don't cut the feet

89
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,680
out from under the designers right

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,420
because the the every person on your

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,019
team is making lots of little micro

92
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,319
decisions every day that that that may

93
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,780
impact on architecture way things work

94
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,060
all kinds of things it's going to impact

95
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,440
in in the product and perhaps they've

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,200
spent a whole bunch of time going down

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,200
this route that then the designers come

98
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,000
out with a a new way of Designing that

99
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
then has a massive

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,400
cost and impact on the way the product

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
goes together and that that could have

102
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,360
been

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,000
maybe reduced by having these two groups

104
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,400
work closely together so that the team

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,159
better understood the long-term

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,560
strategic direction of what it is that

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,820
the designers are trying to do and that

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,739
they can incorporate some of those

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,139
things into their continuous decision

110
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,400
making right that way they make more of

111
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,500
the right decisions and less of the

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,180
wrong ones and and bringing those two

113
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,460
groups together so that for me is the

114
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,259
the second part to that story not just

115
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,880
bringing hypothesis driven Engineering

116
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,280
in which

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,380
should be there anyway right but also

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
how do we bring these two groups closer

119
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,560
together

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,560
um and how do you balance how much of

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,280
this work you do up front

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,220
um

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
and how you integrate it in to the

124
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,520
stream of value that you're actually

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,800
actually delivering on a continuous

126
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,740
basis so how do you bring this all

127
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,740
together into a unified strategy so you

128
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,780
can continue not only in the small scale

129
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,060
continually and repeatedly deliver value

130
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,380
to the customers right but also in the

131
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,820
hypothesis driven engineering

132
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,860
continuously run lots of little

133
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,080
experiments maybe five or six little

134
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,759
experiments a Sprint we're trying to see

135
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,280
the numbers change so that we can spend

136
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,960
more time in that area but that data

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,540
from that those hypotheses are then

138
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,220
feeding back into the story that the

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,560
designers working with the product owner

140
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,940
and the whole team are figuring out like

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,740
where are we actually going with the

142
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,160
product how are we shaping and changing

143
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,400
it and how do we incorporate those

144
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,380
long-term strategic initiatives into

145
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,320
this Sprint cycle where we have this

146
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,440
regular delivery Cadence so answering

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,300
all of those questions is for me the

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,620
main purpose of the professional scrum

149
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,620
