1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:09,300
scrum is a lightweight framework that

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,940
helps people teams and organizations

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,820
generate value through adaptive

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,220
solutions for complex problems

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,920
the scrum framework is made up of five

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,039
values three accountabilities three

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,140
artifacts and five events

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,180
in this video I'll go through an

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,880
overview of each one explaining what

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,239
they're for and why they are there

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,340
Focus will be on the process itself and

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,320
will leave any complementary practices

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,500
until later

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,800
my name is Martin henchewitz I've been a

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,180
professional scrum trainer for 12 years

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,719
professional kanban Trainor for two

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,000
years and a Microsoft MVP in devops for

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,879
14 years

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,160
scrum is based on empiricism

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,340
the three pillars of which are

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,860
transparency inspection and adaption

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,080
empiricism is impossible without

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,080
transparency and in order to get

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,960
transparency we need trust without it

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,240
we'd be unable to see what's going on

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,360
trust is not something that just happens

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,360
it needs considerable and deliberate

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,240
effort to create and maintain

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,180
five scrum values help guide and inform

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,460
the team decisions and help support

31
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,960
trust and empathy

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,759
these values are courage Focus respect

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,920
openness and commitment

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
their purpose is to help build and

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,320
support the trust needed to maintain the

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,560
transparency required

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,900
to get the most effective teams the

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,180
three accountabilities

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,000
although you may see these same names

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,100
used as job titles this was not the

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,560
intent of the scrum framework and as the

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,600
result of 25 years of accumulated

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,399
misunderstandings

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,860
there are three accountabilities in

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,979
scrum which together form the scrum team

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,020
the scrum team is entrusted by the

47
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,080
organization to create value for each

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,900
Sprint they operate as a decentralized

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,879
collaborative and autonomous team that

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,520
is responsible for stakeholder

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,980
collaboration verification maintenance

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,160
operations experimentation research

53
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,379
development and anything else that might

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,940
be required to create a successful

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,580
product

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,099
the accountability of the scrum team is

57
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,800
to effectively create a usable working

58
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,920
product of the highest possible value

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,860
let's see how that breaks down

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,800
the product owner is accountable for

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,180
maximizing the value of the work done by

62
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,160
the scrum team

63
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,860
there are many activities that they

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,879
might imply to help them maximize that

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,599
value

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,120
for example developing and explicitly

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,920
communicating the product goal creating

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,500
and clearly communicating product

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,840
backlog items ordering product backlog

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,140
items and ensuring that the product

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,180
backlog is visible transparent and

72
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,519
understood

73
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,640
file the product owner remains

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,080
accountable there is no requirement for

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,280
them to physically do this work

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,560
themselves

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
delegating some are all of these

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,080
activities enables the product owner to

79
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,080
scale and to focus on the strategies

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,480
they need to be successful

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,959
scrum developers are accountable for

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,180
creating a usable working product

83
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,040
the term developers here includes

84
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,500
everyone involved in developing the

85
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,319
product those folks may have skills and

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,959
Analysis user experience coding testing

87
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,180
legal architecture devops or whatever

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,640
other skills are required

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,260
the developers take accountability for

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,019
planning quality and each other

91
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,840
the scrum Master is accountable for the

92
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,879
effectiveness of the scrum team they do

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,040
this by providing services to the

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,620
developers the product owner and the

95
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,060
organization as a lean agile

96
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,159
practitioner

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,620
they have deep knowledge of the

98
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,120
technology required by the scrum team to

99
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,100
be successful

100
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
these Technologies might include

101
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,079
processes practices tools and techniques

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,940
relevant to the context of the product

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,040
under development

104
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,440
they Foster relationships between

105
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,060
developers the product owner and the

106
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,520
stakeholders to create an environment

107
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,320
with which within which they can all be

108
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,320
successful

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,680
the scrum Master does not write or order

110
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,040
backlog items administer jira or tell

111
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,600
the developers what to do

112
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,600
in addition to these three

113
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,540
accountabilities there are stakeholders

114
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,699
stakeholder is a general term given to

115
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,860
anyone outside of the scrum team that

116
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,560
has an interest in their work

117
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,440
while stakeholders do not have specific

118
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
accountability they are expected to be

119
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,240
involved in the process by providing

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,199
feedback and collaborating with the

121
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,020
scrum team as often as needed

this type of content

126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,280
there are three artifacts in scrum

127
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,440
without being able to see what is going

128
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
on we can't really make effective

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,539
decisions and each of the artifacts

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,340
exists to provide the transparency that

131
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,900
is the foundation of any empirical

132
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,660
system

133
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,900
to provide this transparency there are

134
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,020
three artifacts in scrum

135
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,960
first is the product backlog the purpose

136
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,840
of which is to provide transparency over

137
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,180
what we need to do next that is it

138
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,280
provides transparency of the future

139
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,380
the product backlog is an ordered

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,020
inventory of things that we need to be

141
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,300
true for the product to be successful it

142
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,340
should not contain more items than the

143
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,740
product owner can easily understand and

144
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,720
articulate but enough to Foster

145
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,919
understanding and the success for the

146
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,840
product

147
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,820
too many items create too many

148
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,979
assumptions

149
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,419
the commitment to the product backlog is

150
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,300
the product goal

151
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,940
product goal reflects the desired

152
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,120
outcome for the next few Sprints and in

153
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,860
forms but does not control the contents

154
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,280
of the product backlog

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,039
while the product goal provides focus it

156
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,039
does not preclude incorporating feedback

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,900
features of opportunity or other things

158
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,900
as needed

159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,960
next is the Sprint backlog

160
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,840
Sprint backlog contains three things

161
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,780
a Sprint goal the work that the

162
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,479
developers have selected for this Sprint

163
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:56,280
and an implementation plan to help them

164
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,680
get started

165
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,259
the purpose of the Sprint backlog is to

166
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,440
provide transparency over what we are

167
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,060
doing now Ergo transparency of the

168
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,360
present

169
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:12,240
the commitment to the Sprint backlog is

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,460
the Sprint goal which informs but does

171
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,720
not control the contents of the Sprint

172
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,060
backlog

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,280
during the Sprint the contents will

174
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,139
dynamically adapt to the changing needs

175
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,160
of the scrum team in the business while

176
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,740
maintaining the focus of the Sprint goal

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,020
Sprint goal is collaboratively created

178
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,599
and owned by the scrum team and reflects

179
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,940
the why of the Sprint

180
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,520
while the Sprint goal may only reflect

181
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,340
part of the Sprint backlog with

182
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,160
attention also given to augmenting

183
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,800
existing functionality refactoring and

184
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,840
updating the product dealing with

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,380
technical atrophy and creating

186
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,380
automation

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,900
lastly we have the product increment

188
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,240
representing the entire product it

189
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,780
provides transparency over what we have

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,960
done I.E transparency of the past

191
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,599
each consecutive increment is a concrete

192
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
step towards the product goal and must

193
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,120
be usable

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,000
usable is a combination of backlog items

195
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,280
themselves and the quality measures that

196
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,379
represent completeness

197
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,560
formal description of those quality

198
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:28,199
measures is the definition of done

199
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,599
the definition of done is the commitment

200
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,640
to the product increment it represents

201
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,620
the minimum product and Technical

202
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,979
qualities that are required to be able

203
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,680
to deliver your product to customers it

204
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,620
should mirror shippable

205
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,360
there are five scrum events that serve

206
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,300
empiricism

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,480
Sprint planning daily scrum Sprint

208
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,300
review and Sprint retrospective are all

209
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,820
time boxed events this means that you

210
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,339
should spend enough time fulfilling the

211
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,220
purpose of each event but not more than

212
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,339
the maximum specified in the time box

213
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,339
wrapping the entire scrum process is the

214
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,399
Sprint itself the Sprint is our fixed

215
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,380
length iteration within which in all the

216
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,140
other activities are completed and

217
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,519
represents the Cadence of adaptation

218
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,080
between the scrum team and the

219
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,820
stakeholders

220
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,240
while mentioned in the scrum guide

221
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,760
product backlog refinement is not a

222
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,279
specific event it's a term that

223
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,260
represents all of the work done by the

224
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,019
scrum team on items in the product

225
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,640
backlog rather than those selected for

226
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,700
the current Sprint

227
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,519
all of the work to understand evaluate

228
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,800
document and size things that may end up

229
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,440
in future Sprints is regarded as

230
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,740
refinement and every member of the scrum

231
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,260
team participates as needed

232
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,839
it's also important to note that scrum

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,360
is 25 years old and the technology

234
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,060
available to us at the time necessitated

235
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,140
a clear focus on people being physically

236
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,779
together

237
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,839
applying new technological advances to

238
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,660
the context of scrum are allows teams to

239
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,120
operate in both synchronous and

240
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,220
asynchronous collaboration as needed

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,720
while still fulfilling the intent of the

242
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,720
scrum values

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,540
the first event in scrum is Sprint

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,820
planning this event is where the scrum

245
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,740
team inspects the product backlog and

246
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,740
adapts the Sprint backlog

247
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,380
its purpose is to plan the Sprint

248
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,839
Focus for the upcoming Sprint is created

249
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,720
with the Sprint goal that is formulated

250
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
by the scrum team the developers then

251
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,399
select items from the product backlog

252
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,339
that best enable them to work towards

253
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,320
this goal while considering the order of

254
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,579
the product backlog and the needs of the

255
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,220
product

256
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:52,380
these choices may also trigger a change

257
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,320
in the Sprint Cup

258
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,600
next the developers create enough of an

259
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,480
implementation plan to allow them to get

260
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,040
started creating too much of an

261
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,579
implementation plan would create

262
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,820
excessive overhead for the scrum team as

263
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,399
new information is discovered

264
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,980
the output of Sprint planning is the

265
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,060
Sprint backlog which contains the Sprint

266
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,660
goal

267
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,120
selected backlog items and enough

268
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,260
implementation details to get started

269
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
foreign

270
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:28,440
next is the daily scrum

271
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
daily scrum is a daily event by and for

272
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,180
the developers where they maintain the

273
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,519
transparency of the Sprint backlog based

274
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,040
on what's happened since the last one

275
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,839
the purpose of the daily scrum is for

276
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,600
the developers to plan what they are

277
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,459
tactically doing next to achieve success

278
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,140
in this Sprint

279
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,959
based on the work that has been

280
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,839
completed and new learnings uncovered

281
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,700
since the last daily scrum we may need

282
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,959
to adapt the contents of the Sprint

283
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,899
backlog

284
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,480
while this tactical plan may change the

285
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,180
Sprint goal remains constant and only

286
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,399
the product owner can choose to abandon

287
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,320
the current Sprint goal and the Sprint

288
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,779
itself

289
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,920
the Sprint review occurs near the end of

290
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,440
the Sprint

291
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,720
this event includes both the scrum team

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,640
and stakeholders and is where the work

293
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,380
for the scrum team is offered for

294
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,720
inspection

295
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,420
purpose of the Sprint review is to plan

296
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,519
what's mixed and maintain transparency

297
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,220
of the product backlog

298
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,220
in pursuit of this transparency of the

299
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,620
future we need to reconcile the impact

300
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,140
of changes in the product the business

301
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,300
and the market since the last Sprint

302
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,920
review on the product backlog and the

303
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,680
product goal

304
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,019
this is a collaborative event where we

305
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,820
physically update the product backlog to

306
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,459
bring it in line with our current

307
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,740
understanding of the future maintaining

308
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,079
its transparency

309
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,839
finally we have the Sprint retrospective

310
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,360
it occurs immediately after the Sprint

311
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,120
review and allows the scrum team to

312
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,040
inspect themselves and adapt their

313
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,660
processes practice these tools and

314
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,940
relationships

315
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,760
purpose of the Sprint retrospective is

316
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,880
for the scrum team to plan how they are

317
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,040
going to increase their effectiveness

318
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
finding ways for the scrum team to be as

319
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,260
effective as possible within the bounds

320
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,800
of the organizational constraints is the

321
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,180
responsibility of the entire scrum team

322
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,100
pushing the bounds of those

323
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,860
organizational constraints is the

324
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,160
accountability of the scrum master

325
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:38,399
these four events wrapped in the Sprint

326
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,620
form a set of concentric feedback loops

327
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,500
that create an empirical process control

328
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,440
system and allow the scrum team to

329
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,660
iteratively and incrementally create the

330
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,519
best possible product within the current

331
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,459
constraints

332
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,880
so the scrum framework is made up of

333
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,880
five values three artifacts three

334
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,459
accountabilities and five events nothing

335
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,279
more nothing less

336
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:08,279
ROM framework is like the timber frame

337
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,980
for your house it does not control the

338
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,560
use that you put to each room its

339
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,079
decorations or its content it does

340
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,660
however give structure and support where

341
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,740
needed to maintain its structural

342
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,959
integrity

343
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,360
if you want to change the timber frame

344
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:25,980
of your house you can but due

345
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,560
consideration must be given to the

346
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:31,139
impact on that integrity
