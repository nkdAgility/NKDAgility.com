1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,319
a hugely important technique for any

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,880
implementation of a cand strategy is to

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,599
visualize your work right you need to be

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
able to see what's going on you need to

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,719
be able to visualize that I'm a big user

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,160
of aure devops I know jira has these

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:23,160
features as well um but being able to

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,519
visually see your cards moving across

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,000
the board the the units of value we

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,720
don't really care about tasks at this

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,279
point right but your smallest unit of

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,440
value to see see them flow across the

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
board see where things are so if

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,960
somebody asks you oh where's this what's

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,320
that what's going on with this is it's

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,320
very obvious where and what it is

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,559
um that

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,079
visualization while super important is

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,760
actually super difficult to create

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:59,120
because we generally make assumptions as

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,719
a team about what each other think the

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,879
system is

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,119
okay so I'll think the system works like

24
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,920
this and another team member will think

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,080
it works like that but we'll think we're

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
on the same page we'll think we

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,119
understand each other on how the system

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
works but because we've never sat down

29
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,920
and had that conversation about how this

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
system works then we don't uh think

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,360
think about I I have a I don't know if

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,720
you've noticed but I kind of like board

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:34,040
games um if you were to take any one of

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,200
these board games off my shelf and throw

35
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:41,119
away the rule book and get four people

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,280
together to um decide they're each going

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,399
to decide how they're going to use the

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,159
pieces and move them around in order to

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,759
get points and then you're going to work

40
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,479
together to solve the problem that is

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,360
the board game you pick a Cooperative

42
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:01,360
one but we don't agree what the rules

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,799
are then how could we possibly have a

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,920
successful game right we're not all

45
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,800
playing the same game because we all

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,959
have not agreed what the rules are

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
that's why games come with a rule book

48
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,400
the first part of implementing a cand

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,879
strategy is you need to write your rule

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,760
book what are the rules of your system

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
how are you going to decide how things

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,400
work so even one of the first decisions

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,800
is what are we going to visual ize on

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
this what we actually going to put on

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,480
the board is it only things on our

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,000
backlog or is it bugs as well what is it

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,560
that's going to go on there and how does

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,159
it move through this system so creating

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,159
uh uh that visualization is super

60
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,440
important so what what I recommend that

61
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,959
you do is uh do a do a workshop get

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,519
everybody together sit down and just

63
00:02:53,959 --> 00:03:00,040
build a board whether you're building it

64
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:05,640
in aure devops or you're building it in

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:08,200
um jira or Trello or just pop open mural

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,680
or Myro and use a digital whiteboard

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,680
right totally free

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,640
form make the decisions write the notes

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,519
and document your system how does your

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,440
system work and agree as a team when you

71
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,440
find differences on how your system is

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:31,680
supposed to work then at the very

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,840
least even if we've still got a system

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,519
that might not be optimal right because

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,400
this is where we are right now this is

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,159
what we're doing right now we at the

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,200
very least have a system that we all

78
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,000
agree is the same

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,480
system right because if we want to play

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,879
together we want to play as a team and

81
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,599
we want to be successful together we

82
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
need to Define what those things are we

83
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,760
need to Define how the system works and

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,200
we all need to be playing in the same

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,239
system if you're struggling

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,000
uh to decide how your system works and

87
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,879
create a definition of workflow then we

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,480
can help you we provide worldclass

89
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,040
camand training from Pro caman as well

90
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,199
as Consulting and coaching for teams

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,799
trying to implement a cand strategy if

92
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,040
you're a scrum team then we always

93
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,520
recommend bringing in flow metrics as a

94
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,479
complimentary practice and have cbang

95
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,479
classes from scrum the door
