In the world of Agile and Scrum, one crucial element often overlooked is the **visualization of work**. It’s not just about getting things done; it’s about understanding the flow of value within your system. As a Scrum Master or Agile practitioner, the ability to visualize your work will empower your team to be more effective, transparent, and aligned. Today, we’ll explore how visualization can transform your Kanban strategy, improve collaboration, and streamline processes for better results.

## **Why Visualization is Crucial**

Visualization is a game-changer when it comes to implementing a successful Kanban strategy. It’s not enough to _assume_ everyone is on the same page—without clear visual cues, your team might interpret workflows and priorities differently.

I’m a huge fan of tools like **Azure DevOps** and **Jira** that allow you to _see_ your work on a board. These platforms make it easy to track the smallest units of value as they move across the board, giving everyone clarity on the status of tasks.

Here’s why it’s so effective:

- 🟢 **Clarity**: At any point, if someone asks, "Where is this item?" the board provides a clear, visual representation of where things are.

- 🟢 **Accountability**: With a visual board, it’s easy to spot bottlenecks or tasks that are stuck, ensuring accountability across the team.

- 🟢 **Transparency**: Everyone in the team has a shared understanding of what’s being worked on and where things stand in the workflow.

But—and this is a _big_ but—while visualization is essential, it’s not always easy to create.

### **The Challenge of Creating a Shared Visualization**

One of the most common issues I see in teams is **misalignment**. You may think you’re all playing the same game, but without clear agreements and documented workflows, you’re likely playing different games with the same pieces. Let me give you an analogy that might resonate.

### **🎲** **Board Games and Kanban: What’s the Connection?**

I’m a bit of a board game enthusiast (yes, I’ve got a collection!). Imagine taking a board game off the shelf, throwing away the rulebook, and telling everyone to make up their own rules. Each player will interpret the pieces differently, and despite their best efforts, the game will fall apart. The same is true for your Kanban board.

If your team hasn’t sat down and _defined the rules_—the workflow, what gets visualized, and how the process works—you’re all playing different versions of the same game. And that leads to confusion and inefficiencies.

## **Writing the Rulebook: Defining Your Kanban System**

The first step to creating an effective Kanban system is to **write your rulebook**. What are the rules of your workflow? How will things move from one stage to the next? It’s crucial to have these conversations as a team, so everyone is aligned.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to get started:

### **Step 1: Define What You’re Visualizing**

- Are you visualizing **backlog items only**?

- Do you include **bugs** and **issues**?

- How granular do you want to get with the **units of value** you’re tracking?

These are questions you need to answer together as a team. The smallest decisions, like what gets put on the board, can lead to misalignment if they’re not clearly defined.

### **Step 2: Map the Flow**

Once you’ve decided what goes on the board, it’s time to decide **how** things move through your system. What are the stages of your workflow, and how does each piece of work transition from one stage to another?

- 🔄 **Backlog** to **In Progress**

- 🔄 **In Progress** to **Review**

- 🔄 **Review** to **Done**

Each of these transitions should be clearly defined, so there’s no ambiguity about what needs to happen at each stage.

### **Step 3: Create a Workshop for Your Team**

I recommend holding a **workshop** to map out the visualization. Get everyone together and build the board from scratch. Whether you’re using Azure DevOps, Jira, Trello, or a simple digital whiteboard like **Miro** or **Mural**, the key is to **collaborate** and agree on how the system works.

Here’s what the workshop should cover:

- 📝 **Write down the rules**: What are the different stages of your workflow?

- 📝 **Agree on how to visualize work**: Do you want to use color coding, labels, or different types of cards for different work items?

- 📝 **Document the process**: Create a shared document that outlines the rules and the workflow, so everyone has a reference point.

The goal of this workshop is not just to create a perfect system from the start but to create a system that **everyone agrees on**. Even if the system is not 100% optimized yet, the alignment is key. Everyone should be playing the same game with the same rules.

## **Why Alignment Matters**

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned from years of working with teams is that alignment beats optimization every time. You can have the most efficient workflow in the world, but if your team is not aligned on how the system works, you’ll never reach your full potential.

By taking the time to define your Kanban system and visualize your work, you’re setting your team up for success. Everyone will be working toward the same goal, with the same understanding of how things should flow.

### **What If You’re Struggling?**

If your team is struggling to define the workflow or visualize the system, don’t worry—you’re not alone. Many teams face this challenge, especially when they’re new to Kanban or Scrum. That’s why we offer **world-class Kanban training** and **consulting services** to help teams like yours implement effective Kanban strategies.

## **Bringing in Flow Metrics**

For teams that are using Scrum, I always recommend bringing in **flow metrics** as a complementary practice. Flow metrics can help you understand where work is getting stuck, how long it takes for work to move through the system, and where you might have inefficiencies.

By combining flow metrics with your visual board, you can make data-driven decisions that improve your team’s performance over time.

## **Conclusion: Visualize, Align, and Succeed** **🎯**

Visualizing your work is a foundational practice in any successful Kanban or Scrum implementation. It provides clarity, transparency, and accountability for your team. But more importantly, it ensures that everyone is aligned on how the system works. Without that alignment, even the best-laid plans will fall apart.

So, take the time to define your workflow, create a shared visualization, and ensure your team is playing the same game. If you’re struggling to get started or need guidance on improving your system, we’re here to help. Our **Kanban training** and **coaching services** are designed to help teams implement best practices and achieve their goals. In the end, it’s not just about moving cards across a board—it’s about moving your team toward success.
