1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,480
one of the common uh myths in scrum um

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,199
is kind of a a a proxy myth this proxy

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,160
myth is you know why do we spend so much

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,720
time working on story

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,400
points um when story points measure

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,240
complexity and not time and then we have

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,400
to figure out how many story points fit

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,920
in a Sprint right and I I 100% agree

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,760
with that that part is not a myth the

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,640
bit that's a myth is that story points

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,559
are even a scrum thing in the first

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,559
place they're not story points has

13
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:49,039
nothing to do with scrum it never has a

14
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:52,120
part from as a practice potentially

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,320
complimentary practice that teams choose

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,120
to take on in order to get to an

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,519
outcome when you find complimentary

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,960
practices are not adding value you

19
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,799
should be be stopping doing them not

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,680
continuing with them so if you're in

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:12,080
that position where you find that story

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,520
points are not adding value great stop

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,759
doing them and choose something else

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,880
choose a different way the guy that

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,520
invented story points or that is

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,799
generally accredited with inventing

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,400
story points has a public apology online

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,479
for creating them in the first place

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,000
because of how they are tend to be used

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,000
within organizations as a pseudo proxy

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,600
for time to beat developers around the

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
head with right they were originally

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,439
invented as a reasonable way for

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,479
developers to sit and have a

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,320
conversation and find out figure out

36
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,640
what they don't know that's the purpose

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
in story points we can all get together

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,079
we we maybe use another complimentary

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,479
practice called planning poker and all

40
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,599
that really is is we we keep our cards

41
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,800
to ourselves right we we're not going to

42
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,120
tell each other what story point we're

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,319
going to pick how complex t-shirt sizes

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,680
right whatever you pick how complex this

45
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,959
thing is and you've got one developer

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,560
that says this is a small or a one right

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,959
you've got four developers that say that

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,920
this is a five or a medium and then

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,000
you've got one developer that says this

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:40,800
is an extra large or a 21 right and the

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,280
idea is what do they know that we don't

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,920
or what do we know that they

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,480
don't that's the

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,319
purpose of story points and complexity

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:57,280
conversations it should be used almost

56
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,400
solely during refinement in order to

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,519
enable teams to right size their backlog

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,920
items and decide do they fit in a Sprint

59
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,440
do we understand them or do we

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,720
not after that delete the numbers

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,760
they're

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,440
useless don't use them anymore that's

63
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,200
their purpose for that one context don't

64
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,760
bring them into the wider

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,920
