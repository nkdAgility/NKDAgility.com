There are no direct or indirect references to SLE, probability-based time ranges, or the use of historical cycle time data. The audience overlap is minimal: although both topics (Product Ownership and SLE) are relevant in Agile teams, this article is squarely aimed at teaching Product Owners how to be effective in their business and communication skills rather than any operational forecasting or predictability practice like SLE. No penalties are assessed as the content is neither outdated, critical, nor otherwise misaligned in tone.

Ethos is not directly mentioned. The main ideas align more with best practices and tactical guidance than an exploration of ethos as defined in the classification.
