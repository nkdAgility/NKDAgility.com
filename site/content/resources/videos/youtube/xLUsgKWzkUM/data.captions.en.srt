1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,240
product owner is accountable for

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,440
spending the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,200
money right a product owner is

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,559
accountable for that if you even if as a

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,000
product owner you only have control over

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,760
ordering that product backlog right

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,039
maybe you can't even delete stuff from

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,880
the product backlog maybe you can't add

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,240
new stuff that you come up with yourself

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,880
but you're just ordering that product

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,000
backlog then you're controlling the

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,680
budget you're deciding when we deliver

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,120
each piece of functionality um and that

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,120
that's that's really powerful
