[Music]

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,279
And I think we're live. Are we John? We

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
are indeed. Well, welcome everybody. I

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
hope there is somebody out there. If you

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,160
are out there, drop us a a message in

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
the public chat and just let us know

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
you're there. Um, today we're going to

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,480
be having a conversation, a discussion

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,399
about the open guide to Kambban. a truly

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,920
and I do mean this most sincerely

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
although I sound like a movie actor now

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,440
but I do mean this truly when I say this

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,399
has been a deeply collaborative effort

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,920
amongst a great number of people who

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
describe themselves as flow

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,160
practitioners or people who care about

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
the the concepts around flow and the

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,399
constructs around flow. I'm sorry

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,640
they're not all here today but different

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
uh commitments mean they can't all be

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,960
online at the same time. They're they're

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
out earning a living. Um, but I think

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
this is going to be a nice conversation

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
and I'm going to give an opportunity for

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
my fellow colleagues who are on the call

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,759
to to say hello and just to to let you

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,119
know what their thoughts are and then

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
we'll get into a bit of a discussion

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,560
about the guide that is now live folks.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,400
It is now live cambanguides.org.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,720
Unless I'm wrong, you'll see a banner

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,640
going across the screen now. So, it is

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,079
live. It's a similar familiar interface

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,000
you'll find thanks to our friend Martin

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,439
um who's done some mastery in the last

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,680
48 hours to get that up and um and it's

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,799
available to download currently in in UK

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,840
and US formatted documents A4 and letter

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,759
size in English and I'm sure as the

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
community rallies around different

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,640
translations will start to emerge so

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,799
they're more followable in your local

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
language around the nuances of some of

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,479
the link linguistics we've had to to

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,879
play with to get a guide that we could

46
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,840
reach consensus in the majority of the

47
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,680
Kambban and FLO communities. Um I'm

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,640
going to stop talking now guys and let

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,920
you say something. So I could just say

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,040
just a few words. I want to thank a lot

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,879
of people who don't want to be named and

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
there's a number of people who are happy

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,599
to be named and so Jim Benson

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
um famous for the lean coffee and

55
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,239
personal canban and also does a lot of

56
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,440
work in Obe

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,160
Andy Carmichael uh formerly from KBAN

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,160
University still very much stalworth in

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,800
the uh in the Kanban community Jose

60
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
Cassal who's been in Kban University and

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,720
Proanban and and the flight levels

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,959
community, Magdalena Furlit in scrum.org

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,280
uh from Poland, Michael Forny who's here

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
with us as well on the on on this uh

65
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,879
live stream and of course Martin

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,080
Hinchelwood uh who is a wonderful

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,400
reviewer but also enabled us as well to

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
have uh open discussions. So on the

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,040
website that we'll look at later on uh

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
you can actually uh contribute to the

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
discussion and uh Martin was basically

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,280
the architect of that. We'll talk more

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,120
about that uh later. Um in addition, we

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
basically had Christian Neverdal as

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,800
well. He's a PKT, a Proanban and uh

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,040
someone who does this stuff all the

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,319
time. So he doesn't just train, he's

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,000
consulting all the time, just like a lot

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,159
of the reviewers here. Nad Talai as well

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
from Camban University, also from the

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
safe community. Steve Tendon from the uh

82
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,360
Tameflow community uh author of many

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,280
books and of course here our wonderful

84
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,159
Nigel Tuttler here on the screen as

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
well. So really looking forward uh to

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,360
sharing uh this document with you Martin

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,799
I'm going to hand this over to you next

88
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,080
if you want to say a few words.

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,959
Sure. I think um one of the things that

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,680
I apart from doing reviewing the

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:13,519
document which I was all very uh honored

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,360
to do um I wanted to help leverage my

93
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
technical skills. I think I'm the

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,320
technical one in the in in the group

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,919
from a from a software perspective. Um

96
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,919
to help enable a greater community

97
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,759
around the document. Um, so we're we're

98
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,720
leveraging GitHub. Many of you might not

99
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,280
be familiar with GitHub. It's not as

100
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,280
hard as it sounds. Um, but it does give

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,600
us a bunch of capabilities that that

102
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,199
that are great. One is that all of the

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,840
the the document is in markdown, in

104
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,800
text, in source control. So if you want

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,479
to fork the repo is probably something

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,800
that you will you will figure out how to

107
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,360
do. uh but copy it, make changes, and

108
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,759
send us uh requests for changes. That's

109
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,320
super easy to do. Um even better than

110
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,080
that, it comes with a pretty leveraged

111
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,199
discussion forum capability built in. Um

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,199
so we can we can have discussions, we

113
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,720
can debate over different topics and um

114
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,960
as other other guides have done maybe

115
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
that results in meetings and live

116
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
discussions as well when you need to

117
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
hash things out um and then somebody can

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,240
make the changes and and submit them and

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,880
it's not all on the people who were part

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,440
of the original group. anybody can go

121
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,160
and fork that create uh uh changes um

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,280
specifically for new languages. Uh so

123
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,840
one of the things that we're able to

124
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,320
support is that the whole site is multi-

125
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,960
language not just the guide itself. So

126
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,960
one of the the common barriers is how do

127
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
you find your language on a site that's

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
predominantly in English if you don't

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,280
speak English right? So the whole site

130
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,960
is is translatable. Um, and we also

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,840
maintained all of the existing content

132
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,240
um, from the previous uh, uh, Kamban

133
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,240
guide uh, documentation. So, they're all

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,880
all available on the site, including the

135
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,120
the translations from previous versions

136
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,199
are in there already as as PDFs at the

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,960
moment. Um, but if folks want to come

138
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
along and turn them into markdown, we

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,720
can we can have the whole site in French

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,800
with all of the history of uh the

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,960
cambangan guide as well as the new open

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,000
cam guide. Um, and I think that that

143
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,080
openness is really important. Um, it's

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,919
kind of akin to open source. It's not

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
really open source because it's it's a

146
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,880
document. It's creative commons. It's

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,360
more in that context. Um, but the more

148
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,440
community engagement we can have, the

149
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,560
the the better the better I think the

150
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,039
document will be as well.

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,400
Uh, thank you Martin. Uh, Michael, could

152
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,599
you say a few words as well, please?

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,080
Yeah. Um I find passionately the fact

154
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,360
that um not being a native speaker

155
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,160
myself uh I I understand that a lot of

156
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,199
community might struggle as Martin

157
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,080
mentioned but what we've seen right in

158
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,479
the when we were reviewing the documents

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,880
and sharing we received an

160
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,199
overwhelmingly number of requests of

161
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,759
translations. So I think that that's a

162
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,639
very good symptom that the spirit of

163
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,520
this initiative it's already out there.

164
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,720
So people want to part participate, want

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,520
to help or want to be helped finally in

166
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,919
their own native language. So the fact

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,639
that this is from the community to the

168
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,479
community I think it's really really

169
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,280
powerful and we encourage everyone uh in

170
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,280
in in attending the session today also

171
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
to speak with others that couldn't

172
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,440
spread the word and and finally get uh a

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,000
common ground to stop fighting about

174
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,240
stuff and start understanding each

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,080
other. You know I'd like to say

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
something on that. I think that's a key

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,360
key point this stop fighting with each

178
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,280
other as yeah we all enjoy the echo

179
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
chamber on LinkedIn and other sites to

180
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
to you know duke it out and have a bit

181
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
of fun and give an opinion and stuff but

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,000
the fact that you know the fact you

183
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,759
could bring me I could sat I said this

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,280
earlier when we were chatting before we

185
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,919
went live and saying that you know I

186
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,919
could have sat on the sidelines and keep

187
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,000
throwing rocks and calling BS on things

188
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,560
that I had problems with in previous

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,640
cambes and camb discussions.

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
because of my Toyota roots and because

191
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,479
of my training in the sort of TPS world.

192
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,919
Um uh or I could get involved and I

193
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,440
could give an opinion and have a

194
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,440
conversation and have a discussion. And

195
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
the fact that the theory of constraints

196
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,399
folks and some of the Camban University

197
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,399
folks and other people who see the world

198
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,160
differently to Nigel and Nigel only sees

199
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
the world Nigel sees it. It's not that

200
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,279
I'm right or it's not that I'm wrong. us

201
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,200
to have a v a lens of perception is a

202
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,080
huge achievement that we all managed to

203
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,000
get together and we found language and

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
there was some there's some nuancing and

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,200
people will look at the guide and say

206
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
yeah but you could say this like that

207
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
you could say it like that but think

208
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,640
about this is a huge amount of people

209
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,600
that have come together almost all the

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,320
the the key proponents and actually have

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,399
said we can find words we can live with

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
and when I did my old Lego series play

213
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,240
stuff years ago we make like shared

214
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
models, you know, shared mental model

215
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,480
type thing. And it was, you don't have

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
to agree with everything, but can you

217
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,720
live with it? And that's where I found

218
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
myself. There's some great words in

219
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,240
there about Toyota and about lean

220
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
thinking and some of the things I'm

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,200
passionate about that everybody can live

222
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,440
with because they don't disagree. And we

223
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,120
found words that expressed it. And it's

224
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
the same for me when I look at some of

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,959
the measures and metrics that are sort

226
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
of the same thing with different names.

227
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,320
But that's okay because if it's familiar

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,760
to you, use it. It means the same thing

229
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
and you're getting the same result and

230
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,080
the same outcome and that's okay. And I

231
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,720
think that and you know John and I have

232
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,880
had a lot of spats over the years,

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,640
public as well as private, a lot more in

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,399
private than in public. And this I've

235
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
expressed opinions, you know, that eight

236
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,839
out of 10 cat owners might express. Old

237
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,720
English joke there. Um and but we

238
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,200
managed to sit down and say there are

239
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,640
things that we can discuss and agree on

240
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,640
because it's important for the general

241
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
community and the practice. We're

242
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,000
practitioners and and contributors.

243
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
There's people out there just are users

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,880
of the system and they just want

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,279
something they can use with utility to

246
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,640
solve their challenges and help them in

247
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,519
their what are often very complicated

248
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,680
and sometimes complex environments. and

249
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,519
we need to stop fighting and proving

250
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,200
we're the biggest guy in the room or the

251
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
biggest mouth in the room. And we've

252
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
we've done that. And I think that's a

253
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,399
huge achievement. And I thank John for

254
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
doing that, which you know, I'm biting

255
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,120
my tongue hard here now. I thank John

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,560
for doing that. But and I think the fact

257
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,480
that so many people have come together

258
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,160
from so many different, you know,

259
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,959
factions if you like or so many

260
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,720
different uh views on the world of flow

261
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,800
and created something that's very

262
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,040
practical, got great utility. The

263
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
language is relatively easy to follow

264
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,519
and when translations come we'll get

265
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,760
even easier and we made an appendix of

266
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,240
stuff that everybody wanted to talk

267
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,720
about which you can use if it's useful

268
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
to you and say I'm familiar with that

269
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
and I'll go use that because that's

270
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,519
valuable to me. It's not a you must do

271
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
all of this stuff. And I think overall

272
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,240
that's a huge achievement for us all to

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,800
come together and do that.

274
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,519
Indeed. Yeah. It was it was a pleasure

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,959
really to build bridges, wasn't it,

276
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,839
between these communities and and um we

277
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,000
tried to use language that feels a bit

278
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
awkward but also more straightforward at

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600
the same time. For example, people talk

280
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,640
about work in progress or work in

281
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,560
process depending on your community. And

282
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,160
uh we had a comment a few days ago,

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,320
well, isn't that work that started

284
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,120
that's not finished? people kind of

285
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
understand that a bit more, you know, uh

286
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
there's different language about how

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,040
things take, you know, is it flow time,

288
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,200
is it lead time, is it cycle time, and

289
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,320
all sorts of arguments about that. And

290
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,560
so, well, it's elapse time from started

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
to finished. Everybody understands that.

292
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,440
So, when's your started point and when's

293
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
your finish point? And of course, you

294
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,200
could have more than one starter point

295
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
and more than one finish point. And uh

296
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,000
there's a lot of good stuff in in Canban

297
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,519
Guide. We we built on that. And but also

298
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,880
what we did as well was we tried to

299
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,040
achieve more coherence as well. Uh and

300
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,279
um yeah I'd love to hear more about that

301
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
Nigel from you like in terms of like

302
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,720
some of the things that would have

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
bothered you before about Kambang guide

304
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
and maybe I wouldn't say they'd be

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
resolved but like as in you're feeling a

306
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,959
bit more comfortable maybe about what we

307
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
have in this document now. Look, you

308
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,399
know, you mentioned started, finished,

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,480
which is a really important thing

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,880
because people add things into a

311
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,680
backlog, an intake, a queue, whatever,

312
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,720
wherever you receive your requests for

313
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,959
doing work from, whatever you call that.

314
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
Um, and the thing is this, once it's

315
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,240
received, once it's known to you, it's

316
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
work in progress. Work in process. So,

317
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
progress and process for most people is

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
synonymous nowadays. the the

319
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,480
manufacturing world tend to talk about

320
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,959
process and and I talk about progress.

321
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,360
It's just so just to take that as it is.

322
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,200
But the starting and finish concept is

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
because one of the big bug bears for me

324
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,079
is that and Little's law talks about

325
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,040
this and other other clever people out

326
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,079
there that once the work enters the

327
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
queue enters the line for Americans that

328
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
don't like don't get the word queue but

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,480
once you enter

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,440
sorry I live in Texas folks once you

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,839
once work is actually in the queue to be

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,160
done it's in process it's now work in

333
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,040
the system and you count it from that

334
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,760
point and as work transitions from step

335
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,839
to step, stage to stage, I don't know,

336
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,120
column to column, whatever you whatever

337
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,160
language works for you, there is a cue

338
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
at each step and and you know, even on

339
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,199
back in the Toyota days, you know, said

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Kambban is a compromise and the the

341
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,320
effort here is to remove cambans because

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,120
camban is a signaling card. It's a

343
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,839
signal for work or for inventory or even

344
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,480
for transportation. But the more of them

345
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,199
you have, the more inefficient your

346
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,519
process is. So the idea is to reduce the

347
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
number of process steps so things flow

348
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,680
more quickly. Ideally to do, doing and

349
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
done, you know, to coin a phrase, but

350
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
there is more than one doing column. And

351
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,360
if there's more than one doing column

352
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
because of the linear nature of your

353
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
process, then there is more than one

354
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,240
waiting state, more than one queueing

355
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,560
state. And it's important to measure all

356
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,800
of those if you want to find where the

357
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,880
constraints are in the system and to

358
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,480
deal with those. So I think that that

359
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,639
for me was a huge uh clarification in

360
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,160
this work and I think you know that's

361
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,000
one of the big things that stands out

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,839
for me. I have a whole list here but I

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
want to yield to some of my colleagues

364
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
who may tell me the things that stand

365
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,120
out for them.

366
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,720
Yeah. So uh Michael what's uh what's

367
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,000
done what stood out for you actually?

368
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
you were one of the reviewers of this

369
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,839
document and what did you notice

370
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
actually the first time you saw it for

371
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,480
example and maybe what you think about

372
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,160
it now I I think that something that

373
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,040
wasn't stressed enough uh before was

374
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,600
value measuring actual value delivered

375
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,560
there was uh probably I got it wrong

376
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,920
myself but it was too much about the the

377
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,399
process of optimizing the flow and not

378
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,560
enough focus on the value delivered

379
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,440
thanks to these optimization

380
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,320
So when we talk about and it's more on

381
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,560
the why we do this right the how is very

382
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,440
important but the why and and the

383
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,480
feedback loop that we can trigger is

384
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
essential because otherwise we will be

385
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,959
as as we say in my country very good in

386
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,079
driving a sport car right uh on the wall

387
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,959
right and we need to drive it safely. So

388
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,680
the the value uh the clarification of

389
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,800
the of the metrics about value the fact

390
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,160
that we're there to bring value to to

391
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,279
our uh customer I think that that that's

392
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,120
that's an additional part that also

393
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,120
could break some of those

394
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
misunderstandings for those who say oh

395
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,639
you know I don't like KBAN because it's

396
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,040
not focused enough on value. I think it

397
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,720
always been but it was not so evident

398
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:41,680
and clear to everyone else. So in the

399
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,240
appendix where uh on top of the um let's

400
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,320
call it traditional or standard metrics

401
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,639
there's more focus on these additional

402
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,120
metrics that can be useful or not

403
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,440
depends. So your your context will tell

404
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,279
you if that makes sense in your context

405
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
and maybe could be an invitation. Oh

406
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,759
have you ever thought about it maybe you

407
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,800
should consider them right? Um and

408
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,480
another point you know very very

409
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,959
contagious if you want is uh previously

410
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,760
you cannot even mention lead time right

411
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,839
as if it was a bad word and my

412
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,240
understanding was oh you know nobody

413
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,199
gets a common agreement or what we mean

414
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,439
by that so instead of deep diving and

415
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,439
try to investigate what we should mean

416
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,559
about I'll just we don't just mention it

417
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,320
it's not a metric but the end to end is

418
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,640
is is essential right So the the the

419
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,360
level of detail I think that we are

420
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,320
providing to the to the readers to

421
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,200
choose uh the best definition that suits

422
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,919
with them with their situation where

423
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,360
they want to achieve it. It's giving

424
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,240
this guide in my opinion uh more an

425
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,000
holistic view.

426
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,799
I I would agree Michael. I think it's

427
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,320
given it huge value and you know I was

428
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,320
just scanning down as you were talking

429
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,840
and because of that appendix which has a

430
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,600
lot of conventions and additional

431
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
measurements in there that as you say

432
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,440
people can use in their context whatever

433
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,200
works for them. Um but the the the whole

434
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,679
definition we we found ways to make

435
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,520
things that people argue about simple to

436
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,919
understand and one of them for me

437
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,679
favorite one was stable system because

438
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
we talk about system stability and we

439
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,360
can all argue about what is a stable

440
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,120
system what is a cause of instability

441
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,440
and how to measure that and this then

442
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,400
trust me I got loads of opinions on that

443
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,720
but as we said in the guide put simply a

444
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
system that can consistently meet the

445
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,520
demand placed upon it I mean to me

446
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
That's a stable system. I mean in Toyota

447
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
people would agree with that and most

448
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
other people would agree if we're

449
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,000
meeting the demand and the systems

450
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,160
function it's stable. Can it be

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,960
improved? Probably 100%. But it is

452
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,679
stable in in a and so things like that

453
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
really really help me to support this.

454
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,919
And of course as John's showing on

455
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,080
screen now track time is in there and I

456
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,640
pushed for that and and you guys all

457
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,240
said this was okay and the language was

458
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,960
consensed. I'm not going to beat beat

459
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,640
this in this uh webinar, but the the

460
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,720
fact that that was there so people who

461
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,840
are familiar with that or people who are

462
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,919
unfamiliar with it can go look probably

463
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
I want to learn a bit more about this

464
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,840
but it gives them an opportunity now to

465
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,320
do other independent research and be

466
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,080
introduced to terms that might be useful

467
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
or people who know them and choose not

468
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,679
to use them that's okay too because it

469
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,679
may not fit their definition of workflow

470
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
and I think that's a key thing John I

471
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,760
might invite you to to mention that talk

472
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
about the definition of workflow. Yeah.

473
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,120
Because I think and like the definition

474
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,039
of value and the definition of workflow.

475
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,960
I think they're two really important

476
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,840
concepts irrespective of the rest of the

477
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,720
content that everybody really needs in a

478
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,559
working environment. John,

479
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,760
yeah, I can certainly talk about that.

480
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,720
So, um let me just uh share the the

481
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,919
section. So uh very much in keeping with

482
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,200
uh Kamban guide uh we just uh we

483
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,960
thinking in this guide we talk about um

484
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,720
not just coherence with what was

485
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,080
happening before with Toyota and so on

486
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,600
but also everybody talks about you know

487
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,880
outcomes and all that kind of stuff and

488
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,080
of course a lot of people would say well

489
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,360
the quicker you deliver uh outputs the

490
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,640
quicker you get outcomes and there's

491
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,080
truth in that and actually there's a a

492
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
kind of a thinking error in assuming

493
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,799
that it's all about outcomes but because

494
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,919
if you if you're too slow with those

495
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,520
outcomes, you're dead, right? So, so

496
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,440
this guide is trying to get that balance

497
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,440
right about how do you how do you

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,480
optimize your flow and how do you get

499
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,039
that balance right between efficiency,

500
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,919
effectiveness, and predictability and

501
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,280
and so in your definition of workflow

502
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,360
when it's visualized, that's essentially

503
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,799
your your canban board. And you could

504
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,799
have more than one definition workflow

505
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,799
on your board as well, which is fine.

506
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,960
You might have multi-level systems or

507
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,640
you might even have different item types

508
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,159
that have different workflows. And so

509
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
that's okay. You can visualize that if

510
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,600
you want to. And so we're saying, well,

511
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,360
you know, what are the units that go

512
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,039
across the board? If you're in a

513
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
software world, you might be using news

514
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,360
stories or something like that or bugs

515
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,280
or tech debt things like things like

516
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,159
that. Uh if you're in a marketing world,

517
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
you might have different types of

518
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,679
campaign going on and so on. And then

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,880
depending on the item type, you'll have

520
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
a started point and a finish point. So,

521
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
when does the clock start and when does

522
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,440
the clock finish? And for some teams,

523
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,880
it's like when I took the work in. For

524
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
for other teams, it's not when I took

525
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
the work in, it's when I actually

526
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,960
started doing the work. And I don't

527
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
personally like that because that's not

528
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,600
very customer oriented because maybe um

529
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
maybe you've been thinking that you were

530
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,799
only working on for three days. Yeah.

531
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,080
But we told the customer two months ago

532
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
we started, they think it's already

533
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
started. So, you could have different

534
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,559
clocks running, you know, doing

535
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
different elapse time clocks, start to

536
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,000
finish and so on. And so, we tried to

537
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,039
use different language. Yes, we

538
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,360
appreciate a lot of people are using

539
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
work in process, work in progress and so

540
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,039
on, but essentially we're talking about

541
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,039
work that's started but not finished.

542
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,640
Started according to your started point

543
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,080
and finished according to your finish

544
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,559
point and that can be wherever you want

545
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,480
it to be basically. Uh you need to say

546
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,720
how work in progress is controlled and

547
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,320
we were very nuanced about this subject

548
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
actually. Uh we had lots of debates

549
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,000
about this because in essence if you

550
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,720
think about it when you're using work in

551
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,880
progress limits uh essentially you're

552
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,919
just trying to contain the deluge of

553
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,760
work coming in to the to the system and

554
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,760
are there other ways where we can really

555
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,360
genuinely create pull you know where

556
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
when people ask for stuff we we actually

557
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,720
do the work and when people actually

558
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
start work when they've actually got the

559
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
capacity to start it I often see people

560
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,159
saying oh I'm going to start that today

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,520
boss and they put into in progress but

562
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
they can't start it because they're

563
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,039
they're working on something else. So

564
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,280
like bring it in when you're ready, you

565
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,120
know, when you've actually got capacity

566
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,400
to work on. So little things like that.

567
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,080
We talk about that. We talk about

568
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,799
different ways that you can control whip

569
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,799
as well. Uh also we give some examples

570
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,640
as well about some policies. I love the

571
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,640
little bit we brought in kind of going

572
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
back to where this all came from. You

573
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,880
know, why would you let bad work go

574
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,480
downstream or as as Nigel would said

575
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
into the next process. You know, why

576
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,400
would you why would you do that? But uh

577
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
we're being explicit about that. It's

578
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,200
not just about uh optimizing the flow,

579
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
but also can we uh I'm not saying get it

580
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
right first time or anything like that.

581
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm not saying that at all, but can we

582
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,960
do a good professional job? So we we

583
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,679
we're feeling confident it's not going

584
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,200
to come come straight back on us.

585
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
And we still think that you should have

586
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
a service level expectation. It can be

587
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
based on the history of your system. It

588
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
can be based on a selection of the

589
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,320
history. It can also be based on a guess

590
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,240
if you don't have enough data. And it's

591
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,159
it's based on your you know your

592
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
previous history. So like if you do have

593
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,480
history you you would know how much the

594
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,000
previous work took but we can't really

595
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,159
say that what happened in the past is

596
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
going to happen in the future. So some

597
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,000
health warnings around that as well.

598
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay. And then of course you need to

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,520
visualize that as well. So this this is

600
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,280
probably the most important part of the

601
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
guide I would say. It's like this is

602
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,960
kind of like you know what you uh you

603
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,799
don't really have a workflow unless

604
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
you've got these properties and we we

605
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,799
have some recommendations on metrics and

606
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
measures as well and and there's courses

607
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,159
and practices that we want you to follow

608
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
just like in Kambban guide. We want you

609
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
to control the amount of work in the

610
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,080
system. We want you to ensure that you

611
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,520
don't let work rot on the board. Uh a

612
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,000
rot you should have a rotting in

613
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,080
progress limit you know of uh of zero.

614
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,760
Nothing should be rotting on the board.

615
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,679
and and you need to kind of resolve

616
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
impediments as well that cause block

617
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,000
work to to move on you. So you need to

618
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,279
actively manage the work uh make sure

619
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,720
work doesn't get and then of course you

620
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,799
need to improve the flow as well. You

621
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,480
need to uh not just improve the workflow

622
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,919
improve flow the flow of value and so uh

623
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,679
we define value in this as well. We

624
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,440
define stakehold define lots of things

625
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
but remember lots of canban system

626
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,080
members

627
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,000
they can only do so much. So people who

628
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,440
demonstrate leadership we call leaders

629
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,679
not necessarily managers it could be

630
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,679
leaders and teams as well. Um but we

631
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,360
like to see managers if they exist uh

632
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,760
doing what Nigel will call Genchi

633
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,600
Kambutsu go to the source collect the

634
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,960
facts to you know get the right

635
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,440
information so you can make some good

636
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,120
decisions and do it so often that the

637
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
truth actually emerges. Don't do like a

638
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,640
what I call a royal tour visiting once a

639
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,159
year and everybody's putting on their

640
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
makeup and they're you know I'm brushing

641
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,640
my hair unusually and all that kind of

642
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
stuff. uh you know trying to make sure

643
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,799
that it's real that actually people find

644
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,760
out what's going on. So I don't want to

645
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,080
break your flow there pun intended but I

646
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,600
think this is a very important section

647
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,080
for leaders or people who are in senior

648
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,799
executive or management roles and may

649
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,720
call themselves leaders to think about

650
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
because this is their active

651
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
participation.

652
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,640
This is where they get involved in their

653
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,679
phrase, they lean in to go figure out

654
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,080
how to improve the system because a lot

655
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,159
of us in senior roles will complain that

656
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,080
the system isn't functioning optimally,

657
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
whatever that means, and it isn't

658
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,960
delivering the outcomes and outputs we

659
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,799
want. But they do very little about

660
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,840
really getting involved to understand

661
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,320
how we do what we do, how the work

662
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,159
actually gets done. Which brings me to

663
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,559
the other points that I'm I'm really

664
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,559
pleased about in this is that first of

665
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,480
all we declare that Kambban is a

666
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,360
strategy for optimizing the flow of

667
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,840
value through a system and we say it is

668
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,960
a signaling system to call for work or

669
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,120
inventory which is the basic concepts or

670
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,440
constructs behind the way Toyota used

671
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,360
this but it's it's we want to optimize

672
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,080
the flow of value so that we're making a

673
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,240
clear statement on that and and in the

674
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
appendix in the con in the conventions

675
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,640
you'll see that The definition of kamban

676
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
from Japanese means signboard or

677
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,240
billboard and is a visual cue that

678
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,200
triggers one to select i.e. start or

679
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,039
move a work item. Nothing should be

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,400
produced or move without a camban

681
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,679
signal. Now it's not the Toyota folks

682
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,520
will tell me yeah but there's a few

683
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,600
nuances missing there. But the idea is

684
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
this is to show that this is

685
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,440
obstensively a visualization

686
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,559
approach. It's a way to signal and also

687
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,960
to see. You can see the work and if you

688
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,679
make your boards effective you can see

689
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,760
how the work flows through a system good

690
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,240
bad or indifferent and leaders who

691
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,840
choose to come and look at that will

692
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
actually be able to see where the

693
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,039
challenges are the constraints are all

694
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,120
the opportunities for improvement are so

695
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,720
at its heart that's what it is we're

696
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,520
signaling how work gets done we're

697
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,760
focused on the flow of value and I think

698
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,480
these are just the key aspects that most

699
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,799
most of us who are in this flow sort of

700
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
centric industry are trying to achieve

701
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,320
most of the time. So I'm really really

702
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,480
happy with a lot of the the work that's

703
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,640
been put into this.

704
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Thank you very much uh Nigel and I'd

705
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
like to have a chat with Martin actually

706
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,880
about a question that popped in if

707
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,320
that's okay. Um so it was a it was a

708
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,440
scrum question um go and maybe Martin

709
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,799
you can have a go as well. So uh I would

710
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,120
like to add a perspective from scrum and

711
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,799
canban when I pull an item into the

712
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,399
sprint uh during sprint planning to

713
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,080
forecast I'll be working during the

714
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,919
sprint I consider not started items as

715
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,880
items not pulled into the system on

716
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,480
whip. Now it depends. So we mentioned

717
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,840
earlier that you can have more than one

718
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,080
starter point and more than one finish

719
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,679
point, right? So if you're using scrum,

720
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
you'll probably have a started point for

721
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,200
like you brought it into your sprint

722
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,960
backlog maybe and your finish point

723
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,279
might be well you meet your met your

724
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
definition of done and heaven forbid you

725
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,480
don't I hope you when your definition of

726
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,720
done is releasable but if it wasn't

727
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,559
there was something else going on in a

728
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
downstream process you might have

729
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,679
another finish point for when we really

730
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,159
actually released it and got feedback

731
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,679
and so on but actually the I think

732
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,600
people miss a trick when they use scrum

733
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,000
and canban when they just use canban for

734
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
the the sprint backlog piece you can

735
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,039
really be looking upstream and

736
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,799
downstream is the kind of way I kind of

737
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,080
like to describe it. Martin, I'd love to

738
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,320
get your perspective on this. What What

739
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,200
are your thoughts on it? I I think it's

740
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,080
quite a common um issue to run into,

741
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,320
especially as a lot of the tools that

742
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,720
provide metrics around this don't really

743
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
they're not really adequate. My my

744
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,919
background is Azure DevOps. I'm a

745
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,320
Microsoft MVP of Azure DevOps and and it

746
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,480
doesn't do this part very well out of

747
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,399
the box. all the data is there but

748
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,240
getting it out is a little bit a little

749
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,679
bit difficult. You're into PowerBI

750
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,240
realms or third party tools there. you

751
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,559
you want to cons

752
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
I'm Nigel talked about this earlier that

753
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,080
is as as soon as soon as it hits your

754
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,600
backlog at all it's started work right

755
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,200
so you want to have the timer start

756
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,279
there

757
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,240
but you also want to consider the wait

758
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,240
time that it's sitting in your sprint

759
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,360
backlog waiting to come into that sprint

760
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,440
itself but you also want to consider

761
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,360
that

762
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,000
you might not do

763
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,080
Right. Uh the your sprint backlog is a

764
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
list of opportunity.

765
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm going to phrase it that way just for

766
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,760
just for fun. You're it's not no

767
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,240
guarantee that something you put in your

768
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,799
sprint backlog is actually going to get

769
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,559
delivered at all. So there's perhaps

770
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,520
there's perhaps a started finished

771
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,679
moment for for a particular team where

772
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,679
they're looking at we want to understand

773
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,240
the stuff that actually goes through our

774
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,520
system versus things that that wait

775
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,000
there but Nigel will pull me up for you

776
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,679
can't ignore that wait time. Right. So

777
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,120
I've been I've been channeling Nigel a

778
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,679
lot recently and things I've been

779
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,559
waiting for. Yeah. Martin's even built

780
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,840
even built a Nigel bot I believe. But I

781
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,000
don't know why you would do such a

782
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,399
thing. I have I have a chat GTP Nigel

783
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,679
bot that allows me to ask it questions.

784
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:40,880
It's a really good point and this is

785
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,200
where the design of your workflow

786
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,600
i.e. your board, your visualization

787
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
becomes important because is this

788
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,720
prioritized work we're expected to work

789
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,640
on in the near term and if it is it's

790
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,640
started it's in the queue we start the

791
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,799
time because you got item age as one of

792
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,760
the the measures in uh in the in the

793
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:02,399
camban approaches so it's aging somebody

794
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,080
said do this and and it's in an order to

795
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,240
be done well you haven't started

796
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,880
activity on it but it is waiting to be

797
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,559
done it's in the system so little's law

798
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,080
that it means it's it's being measured

799
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,000
from from a throughput perspective. But

800
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,880
so we need a way to distinguish this

801
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,080
from all this other stuff. Now in the

802
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,520
old days and days of Y, I used to have I

803
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,159
still have a column on my board behind

804
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,080
me says ice box. It's stuff I had an

805
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,000
idea about that I'm not actively working

806
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,320
on. It's not really in a queue. It's not

807
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,919
been processed or prioritized, but I

808
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,240
don't want to forget I thought about it.

809
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,320
So I put it in this cold storage so I

810
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,600
can go look at it occasionally. Go, am I

811
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,360
going to move? Am I going to prioritize

812
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,919
that? Is that going to become a thing?

813
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,399
So I think it becomes the decision of

814
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,880
the people in the system to and that's

815
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,000
what it says in the guide anyway to

816
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,159
determine how best to handle that and

817
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
how best to measure the work. The

818
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
problem with it with an ever growing

819
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,360
backlog and a backlog is never ending.

820
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,360
It's always growing. it's you know

821
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,440
people can add to it as scrum will tell

822
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,039
you is that when you know it just start

823
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,679
you get to a point where you just got

824
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,360
this infinite queue of work and thing

825
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,279
and if you look at the kingman equation

826
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,200
and again theoretical mathematics and

827
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,679
stuff and I'm no expert genuinely on

828
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,480
that but it says you know the the if you

829
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,399
start if you start to add things to the

830
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,840
queue and you start to overutilize the

831
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,080
people which is another thing we deal

832
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,679
with in the guide about whip limits and

833
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,039
what they're actually meant to do is

834
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,039
meant to prevent overburden. Um, so not

835
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,320
meant to max out your capacity because

836
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,039
if you max out your capacity, the queue

837
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,039
eventually becomes infinite. So new

838
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,360
things coming into the queue will just

839
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,080
never see the light of day or will take

840
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
eons to see the light of day. So people

841
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,720
who are pract people who start to

842
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,720
practice these things need to look a bit

843
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,440
about queuing theory. Think about the

844
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,919
designs of the boards. Think about where

845
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,159
how things are categorized

846
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,399
and then measure the things that make

847
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:08,880
sense in your context. Yeah. I I I just

848
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,799
wanted to add to that that that um

849
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,919
the way the the system is also a lens

850
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,480
that you look at the work through,

851
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,640
right? So that the the there's there's

852
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,640
the system from the perspective of

853
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,039
potentially this group of people doing

854
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,080
the work that might be your scrum team

855
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,360
and what they care about is when they

856
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,799
actually bring it into their sprint

857
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,279
backlog and they they're going to start

858
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,039
it. That's that's what they care about.

859
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,919
But then you've got product management

860
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,080
who are looking at the wider system

861
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,760
looking at well the customer asked for

862
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,600
it here and we're delivering it to them

863
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,000
to production all the way over oh I'm

864
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,320
not in the view all the way over here

865
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
and they care about that time but the

866
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,080
scrum team's time is only this small

867
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
piece of of that ideally you want to

868
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,720
broaden their story so that it's part of

869
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,840
the the better story but the you've got

870
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,840
the realities of where you are right so

871
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,919
so I I think it's I think it's a great

872
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,919
question and I don't think it's just a

873
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:13,599
camb for scrum teams thing. It's just a

874
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,639
camb thing. Um it's it's the holistic

875
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,720
flow thing and all the kambban guide for

876
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,919
scrum teams is really trying to do is

877
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,560
take these ideas around flow and give

878
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,879
you perspective on them within the

879
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,560
context of scrum.

880
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,480
And scrum itself has that narrower focus

881
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,159
in general, right? From a guide

882
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,119
perspective, it has that narrower focus

883
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,960
on just the scrum team, not the wider

884
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,919
organization, although we do often widen

885
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,560
it out. You know, there's a a question

886
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,960
from Tom. I'll put it on screen. Uh, and

887
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,520
Tom's a stalwart in this industry and a

888
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,839
big influencer to a lot of us in this

889
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,919
and this work indeed. How can we track

890
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,440
the quantity of a particular value like

891
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,160
usability or security? And we it's a

892
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,359
diff it's not an easy one to answer. Um

893
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
John will probably find something

894
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,480
relevant in there, but you've got to be

895
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,440
careful because you've got

896
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,760
quantification measures and and and and

897
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,320
quality measures. So a lot of the

898
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,079
approaches are used are quantitative

899
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,760
these probability forecasts and things

900
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,640
which are discussed in the guide without

901
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,040
using any particular naming. But the the

902
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,720
quantification is what most people are

903
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,720
doing. But we need qualitative metrics.

904
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,079
I was speaking to some doctors and

905
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,960
surgeons this week on a different

906
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,760
broadcast and it'll be out in some weeks

907
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,440
time about the fact that a lot of

908
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
measurements in the health care system

909
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
are quantification.

910
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
You know, number of patients seen a

911
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,079
number of this a number of that and

912
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,680
that's great but it talks nothing about

913
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,520
the quality the quality the qual the the

914
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,680
uh the value that's coming out of the

915
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,720
system. So we do need to start to look

916
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,480
at you know if something like usability

917
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,720
is a quality measure security you can go

918
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,280
both ways on that it's risk mitigation

919
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,200
it's risk avoidance so it's qualitative

920
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,960
but what about the quantitative side

921
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,880
there's different measures so I'm not

922
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,440
going to profer an answer because I'm

923
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,160
not the world's expert on this but again

924
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,880
depending on your context and what it

925
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,880
means to you in your definition of value

926
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,359
which we talk about in the guide

927
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,119
understanding what value means to you

928
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,960
and what value means to your

929
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,960
stakeholders, your consumers, your

930
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,440
clients, your customers, whoever they

931
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,280
are in your context because it will vary

932
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
the whole internal external sort of

933
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,680
discussion about who who's receiving the

934
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,920
value. You need to look at how you

935
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,000
define that and then find the

936
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,480
appropriate ways to measure that. The

937
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,280
guide gives you some suggestions. It's

938
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,680
not a a mandatory list of things you

939
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,480
must do. Nor is it a comprehensive list

940
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,240
of things that you can do. So this is

941
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
where people need to understand their

942
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,160
workflow, understand their context,

943
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,280
understand what makes sense in their

944
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,800
world, use the guide as it what it's

945
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,119
intended to be, a guide, not a recipe,

946
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,119
not a prescription.

947
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,960
Yeah, thank you very much, Nigel. Um, so

948
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm a big fan of Tom's work and um,

949
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,000
I was telling the story about this only

950
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,839
yesterday when when Tom was consulting

951
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,920
up to about 10 years ago, I believe. Um,

952
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,359
he went into a CEO and he uh, he asked

953
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
the CEO like, "What's your most

954
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,680
important project?" And Michael, you

955
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,240
were there. You heard me talking about

956
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,320
this. And uh, and the CEO would say,

957
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,160
"Well, this is my most important

958
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:35,040
project, you see."

959
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,320
And so then um uh Tom asked uh the co

960
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,079
what's what's so important about that

961
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,480
project and and so the co wrote down

962
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,800
what was so important about it you see

963
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,160
and um

964
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,240
so Tom asked the CEO to uh to bring in

965
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,839
the uh chief whatever officers you know

966
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,400
marketing officer finance officer

967
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,480
officer all these officer officer people

968
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,200
and uh they came into the room it was

969
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,960
like we were in person and so on and uh

970
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,880
and I think it was Tom asked so what's

971
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,280
so important important about the this

972
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,440
project and could you write down please

973
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,079
what's so important about it and they

974
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,079
all wrote down something different they

975
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,560
they use words like better you know

976
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,839
weasel words you know you and I give a

977
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,920
give people a little prompt actually you

978
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
can use on any LLM you just say if

979
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,720
anybody tells you that you've got a

980
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,839
clear objective or a clear goal or a

981
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,000
clear requirement just uh write in your

982
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,320
favorite LLM

983
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,760
tell me the ambiguities in the following

984
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,680
text colon uh or sorry using Tom Gilb

985
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
style SQC specification quality control

986
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,680
and then you put in your text and it

987
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,359
will drive a lorry through your

988
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,320
requirements your or truck what you call

989
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:44,960
it in Texas truck a semi semi is a is a

990
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
is another word

991
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,440
so I'm a big fan of quantification for

992
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,680
that reason so you need to have a a will

993
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,040
to to try but we talk about both

994
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,640
quantitative and qualitative because

995
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,000
there are some things that are difficult

996
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,839
like for example cooperation is

997
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
difficult to when you have a relay race

998
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,119
who who's uh who gets the credit if you

999
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
win the race? Is it the person who

1000
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,119
passed the baton or the person who

1001
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,720
received it or it's like uh there's no

1002
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,720
mathematical equation to tell you that.

1003
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,119
So, but it doesn't stop us from trying

1004
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,880
Tom. So, I hope that answers that one.

1005
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,320
Got a few other questions as well. Uh

1006
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,880
one of them is from Mike Levian just

1007
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,640
going back to here. And so, uh the

1008
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,800
campman guide 2025 was also released

1009
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,119
recently. Yes, I was involved in that

1010
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,800
myself. Would you see any contention

1011
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,320
between the two guides? No, actually um

1012
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,000
what we've done is we just built on it

1013
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,320
really. Uh there are some things that

1014
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,760
are a bit different maybe uh different

1015
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,560
perspective because you've got different

1016
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,800
voices and this is an open guide so for

1017
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,880
lots of communities whereas uh maybe

1018
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,359
there was a slightly narrower view in

1019
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,400
Kanang guide but uh it's building on it.

1020
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,760
In fact on the site open guide to kanban

1021
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,640
you can actually see in the history

1022
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,240
section you can see uh the uh the

1023
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,359
previous versions of the current version

1024
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,720
of canban guide a 2025 you can see the

1025
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,320
translations as well for the previous

1026
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,440
versions like uh uh December 2020 July

1027
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,920
2020 and uh I have offered actually to

1028
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,599
the translators if they want to put

1029
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,599
their translations and some translators

1030
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,599
saying yes they want to so uh we're

1031
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,920
opening our arms to people in proamban

1032
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,920
as well to uh to use the site as well

1033
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,960
and uh contribute to this as well and

1034
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,720
all communities actually. Uh so yeah the

1035
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,599
next question is a bit more prickly I

1036
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,240
think. Uh I'm curious if you to know if

1037
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,880
you've had any feedback from Dan Vikanti

1038
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,000
and Pratik Singh uh beyond simply citing

1039
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,520
them in the guide. All I can say is I uh

1040
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,800
communicated with Daniel on the 10th of

1041
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,280
June what I was doing that I was going

1042
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,760
to fork but it's not just me. It is a

1043
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,160
collaboration. It is a a collaboration

1044
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
amongst mult multiple people. So, and

1045
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,800
you can do that. It's open source and

1046
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,200
all that. So, hopefully we did a good

1047
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,520
job with the the uh creative common

1048
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,520
notice. And by the way, because this is

1049
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,359
going to be an open document, it means

1050
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,599
if there if you spot bugs in terms of

1051
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,040
how we did things or what we said or no,

1052
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,720
I don't agree with that formula, I don't

1053
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,319
agree with that description, you can log

1054
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,400
a bug. It's it's completely fine. It's

1055
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,839
open source. It's uh a little

1056
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,520
competition. How many bugs can you find

1057
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,599
per page? Because we kept finding bugs

1058
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,599
on it this morning. So, I'm sure you'll

1059
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,359
find something. Uh so, this will be

1060
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,359
updated more frequently as well. So

1061
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,200
hopefully uh that helps. Mike, thank you

1062
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,839
for the question. I I think I think it's

1063
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:22,640
a a good thing to to point again at the

1064
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:24,720
the link on the kangist.org goes to the

1065
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,920
GitHub repo that backs it where

1066
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,800
everything is and there's a discussion

1067
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,800
forum on there to have conversations

1068
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,599
about some of these ideas. Um and the

1069
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,760
any issues that you have perhaps a

1070
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,400
discussion is a good idea to start with,

1071
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,760
right? Um, sometimes it's not the right

1072
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,160
idea to just create a bug out of the

1073
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,720
gate and say this is wrong because

1074
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,400
perhaps, you know, perhaps it's I'm

1075
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,000
channeling a little bit of Nigel here.

1076
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,839
Per perhaps you're just wrong from your

1077
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,640
perspective, right? And have some some

1078
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,440
other eyes on on your idea. But once you

1079
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,000
do come to a consensus, you can you can

1080
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,000
make the change yourself and submit it

1081
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,680
uh submit it to us and then we'll we'll

1082
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,960
hopefully bring it in as as quickly as

1083
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,480
we can as long as it's relevant,

1084
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,359
pertinent, and there's probably another

1085
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,720
word in there um that I'm looking for

1086
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,520
that I'm not good at those words, but um

1087
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,880
a good change, right? Yeah. Thank you

1088
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,640
very much. And actually, it was a real

1089
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,400
challenge, wasn't it? Uh putting this

1090
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,119
together. I guess my job was kind of

1091
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,200
curating all the wonderful ideas from

1092
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,280
the different communities that are out

1093
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,720
there and and often I say things myself

1094
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,760
that when I go to write it down it's

1095
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,599
like is that really true

1096
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,319
and I often find things that I used to

1097
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,680
say when you write a book you challenge

1098
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,839
yourself when you write a guide it's oh

1099
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,760
my god is it really really true you know

1100
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,599
so you know John I would invite

1101
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,240
people who know my work and my

1102
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,000
background with Toyota and the t years I

1103
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,240
was very lucky to be taught and trained

1104
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
by them and also the conversations I

1105
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,319
have around Toyota's production system

1106
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,839
lean thinking and various discussions of

1107
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,359
that there are a lot of people in that

1108
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,880
community

1109
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,480
who could now get involved if they

1110
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,000
disagree with the way I've worded

1111
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,319
something or the way I've tried to

1112
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,960
channel my training over the years into

1113
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:24,319
some of the the nuanced words they also

1114
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,200
are invited to participate in this to

1115
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,599
help us evolve how to use these

1116
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,640
techniques that originated in Toyota

1117
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,880
that were inspired others like David

1118
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,079
Anderson and others to adopt some of

1119
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,839
these ideas and bring them forward. And

1120
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,839
if you think that some of the nuance

1121
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,280
language could do with improving or

1122
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,200
there's something that's missing or

1123
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,119
something that's misworded, you now have

1124
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,480
an opportunity to contribute. You have

1125
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,440
now opportunity to go to the the

1126
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,680
website, grab kambanogs do

1127
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,880
kambanguides.org as it's on the screen

1128
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,839
now. uh go and get into the discussion

1129
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,319
and contribute an improvement, a fix, a

1130
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,680
suggestion or have a bit of a a

1131
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:06,319
conversation and a debate with the

1132
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,920
people in there and that will help us to

1133
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:13,760
improve it even further. My my focus

1134
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,599
here my effort was to try and

1135
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,599
explain the distinguish how we

1136
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,760
distinguish Kambban in manufacturing

1137
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,680
from Kambban in non-manufacturing

1138
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,599
so-called knowledge work not just

1139
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,880
software development which has been used

1140
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,480
in of course a great deal and to nuance

1141
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,960
that the difference between push and

1142
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,160
pull systems that's in there what a whip

1143
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,160
limit describes versus how Toyota pulls

1144
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,839
things and how they self-regulate the

1145
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,160
system and we'd like to see

1146
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,760
self-regulating pull systems in there.

1147
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,400
These are the things we'd like to see

1148
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,000
emerge. The the guide doesn't say you do

1149
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,160
it this way or that way. It gives you

1150
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,119
some suggestions and guidance as in a

1151
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,960
guide, but it does tell you that in your

1152
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,040
context, it would be great if you could

1153
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,720
do some of these things, but it leaves

1154
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,359
that open for you to do that. So have

1155
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,920
anybody in the community that are

1156
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,319
considered lean focused practitioners,

1157
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,720
Toyota focused practitioners, the people

1158
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,240
who I looked up to as leadership and who

1159
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,440
taught me over the years and others I

1160
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,200
still collaborate with. If you want to

1161
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,800
make it a little bit better, this is

1162
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,760
your now opportunity to do so.

1163
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,560
Thank you, Nigel. Um Michael, I'd love

1164
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,760
to get your perspective as well. Um I

1165
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,520
think you had a couple of topics that

1166
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,720
you wanted to bring in. The floor is

1167
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:33,440
yours. Yes. Especially for those who

1168
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:36,480
might have been uh pushed back by uh the

1169
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,560
the KBAN stuff. They did not understand

1170
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,760
and maybe there was a lot of concepts

1171
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,960
that were not explained in brick layers

1172
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,040
theorem as they say in in England. I

1173
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,440
think this guide helps to understand

1174
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,760
more what we're talking about. Uh help

1175
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,440
us to to break those barrier and those

1176
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,560
misunderstanding. Oh, this is just for

1177
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,800
manufacturing. No, it's not. Uh takes a

1178
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,359
lot from that, right? It's it's a it's

1179
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:07,040
an important uh DNA. But what struck me

1180
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:10,560
probably from the first reading was that

1181
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,240
was that part where is written you don't

1182
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,160
need to start with everything but if you

1183
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,079
don't want to start at least start from

1184
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,640
here. So the starting point right a lot

1185
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,119
of people struggle in getting things

1186
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,040
perfect before even starting. Start

1187
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,000
where you are. Start making a

1188
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,800
difference, right? Start reducing by one

1189
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,440
day your delivery time. It's already an

1190
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,520
improvement and move on from there,

1191
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,119
right? So the fact that this guide helps

1192
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,920
you also to orient yourself in a world

1193
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,400
that might seem um and that's my

1194
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,800
personal opinion slightly from the

1195
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,920
academia different difficult to

1196
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,119
understand not for me uh or stuff like

1197
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,599
that probably will bring more people to

1198
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,160
give themselves a chance to read this to

1199
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,319
understand it and scratch your head and

1200
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,680
say you know what I can grab some of

1201
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,800
this stuff and and use it to make my

1202
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,640
team's life uh slightly less miserable,

1203
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,440
right? I'm not saying making their life

1204
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:15,040
perfect, but you know, when when when I

1205
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,839
introduce flow in in with my teams uh

1206
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,760
and I'm and I'm blessed to work with

1207
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:26,160
humans uh not too much AI at the moment,

1208
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,960
but they I think they need uh more

1209
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,280
simplicity than complexity. They need

1210
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,880
their life to be simplified. So these

1211
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,200
concepts can resonate very well with

1212
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,599
their day-to-day experience. So when

1213
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,079
they see something, right, when they

1214
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,920
visualize their work, especially in in

1215
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,880
the scenarios where we're in, they're

1216
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,000
not lucky enough to be in the same room,

1217
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,480
right? So having a board that tells our

1218
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,400
common story is essential. And if you

1219
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,319
don't have a visual radiator that is

1220
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,240
telling what is happening and is not

1221
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,319
triggering the right conversation and

1222
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,560
does not help you to monitor what's

1223
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:06,640
happening, how can you expect people to

1224
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,680
deliver value or to understand uh what

1225
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,960
not to do to work right to maximize the

1226
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,359
work not done intercept waste be before

1227
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,960
it becomes waste. All the concept that

1228
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,319
people that come from the lean and the

1229
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,760
kban uh might might find second nature.

1230
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:26,319
But for some people it's brand new. Oh

1231
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,040
really? Right. The simple things that

1232
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,880
make big changes. It's something that

1233
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,359
not just in the academia, not just in

1234
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,280
the training but in the actual activity

1235
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,440
as consultants that we try to make

1236
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,119
people's life much better.

1237
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:44,319
uh you can really find uh I wouldn't say

1238
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:47,359
solution but definitely tools and not

1239
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,280
just one hummer uh for everything right

1240
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,520
different tools for different scenarios

1241
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,680
depending on where you are so I think

1242
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,800
that's that's something that might

1243
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,359
struck and I would encourage people to

1244
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,040
give it a read and and and and find

1245
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,920
something useful for them be a little

1246
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,240
bit selfish if may say so right help

1247
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,760
your people uh taking in what works for

1248
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,280
Thank you so much uh Michael and um I I

1249
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,559
saw another question came in as well

1250
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,400
about security about you know uh what

1251
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,599
you do about for me for for example

1252
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,480
information security and risk right so

1253
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,720
um one of the things that I love about

1254
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,400
Tom's work is

1255
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,960
it's almost like you're starting with

1256
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,400
who you know we've all seen the video

1257
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
starboard why the golden circle and all

1258
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,359
that and there's some elements of truth

1259
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,800
to that and there's some elements of

1260
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,800
questionable But I still find that a

1261
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,960
useful video nonetheless. You know, it

1262
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,000
it excites people. But really, I think

1263
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,599
for me it's about who like who are our

1264
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,040
stakeholders and we define stakeholder.

1265
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,040
It could be internal, external,

1266
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,119
customers, end users, decision makers,

1267
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,480
governance people, whatever, right? Uh

1268
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,359
and we've got these stakeholders and

1269
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,480
each of them has expectations and

1270
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,680
they've got limits as well like uh one

1271
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,079
of the stakeholders might actually be

1272
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,440
the law actually might uh we we often

1273
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,640
say, "Oh, it's the lawyers." Well, act

1274
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
that's what Meta thought and then they

1275
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,559
got aâ¬ 10 billion euro fine from the

1276
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,480
European Union, you know. So, the law is

1277
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,720
the law is the law. So, like who are

1278
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,960
your stakeholders? What do they expect?

1279
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,240
What are their limits?

1280
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,079
Which stakeholders are more valuable

1281
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,720
than others? And people will often tell

1282
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,960
you, oh, I want a secure system.

1283
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,720
And you know what? Having a secure

1284
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,599
system, I mean, even this website we

1285
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,800
have today, making that 100% secure, do

1286
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,920
you want to know what the cost for that

1287
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,599
is? It's infinite.

1288
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,160
infinite. So, do you have an infinite

1289
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,839
budget? Because I don't. This is a

1290
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,240
collaborative exercise, right? This is

1291
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,480
on a shoestring. We're a bunch of people

1292
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,920
who care about the community putting

1293
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,760
things together. Very much with the

1294
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,119
support of Martin here, getting us up

1295
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,640
and running with the website and so on.

1296
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,960
Really appreciate that. So, like in all

1297
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,640
honesty, what would happen is people

1298
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,160
say, "Oh, I don't want any hacks."

1299
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,040
Really?

1300
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,559
Uh, so no hacks ever?

1301
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,200
Or or would you be okay with uh would

1302
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,280
you tolerate uh maybe one hack every

1303
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,040
five years or is it would you tolerate

1304
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,559
one every six months actually or is it

1305
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,640
more about we don't mind them getting in

1306
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,319
but actually what did they get access to

1307
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,720
and can we close it down quickly you

1308
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,119
know things like that and so what I love

1309
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,800
about Tom's planning language language

1310
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,680
for short plain two world planning

1311
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,680
language is you you quantify you say

1312
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,559
what's the number of hacks for example

1313
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,040
uh uh what's the meter well the number

1314
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,280
of hacks reported on our internal

1315
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,440
dashboard or what's spotted by our AI

1316
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,960
system seeing people getting in. Okay,

1317
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,400
so what would we tolerate? What's

1318
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,319
tolerable? And then what's our goal?

1319
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,440
What are we aiming for? Well, we'd

1320
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,599
actually be okay if you only got hacked

1321
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,640
once a year, you know, and if you

1322
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,680
actually look people in the eyes, they

1323
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,359
might be happy with that. And then uh

1324
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,280
the you know, what's the stretch? Well,

1325
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,960
we only get hacked maybe once every 10

1326
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,520
years or something like that. So you can

1327
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,359
quantify because if people assume that

1328
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,000
we only get hacked once every five or 10

1329
00:51:55,359 --> 00:52:01,280
years uh then don't be surprised if your

1330
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,839
budgets just explode because you've just

1331
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,640
uh goldplated what's uh been asked for

1332
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:08,240
when really we would have expected less.

1333
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,680
So actually quantifying those is very

1334
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,359
important. So just having the will to

1335
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,200
have that conversation is really really

1336
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,599
crucial I think. You know something,

1337
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,440
John, that's where the, you know,

1338
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,680
there's a huge debate about probability

1339
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,800
forecasting, you know, and we won't dive

1340
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:26,400
too deeply into it here, but the the

1341
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,160
area of risk management is where things

1342
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,880
like Monte Carlo simulation and

1343
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,400
probability forecasting comes in. So, if

1344
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,280
you are in an area where you're trying

1345
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,559
to manage risk, uh, and I'm fortunate to

1346
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,880
know people in risk, then that's an area

1347
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,240
where that should be a greater focus.

1348
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,319
And that's we're not going to give you

1349
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,480
the solution in this guide. We're going

1350
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,720
to give you a guide to be able to use

1351
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,079
what we think is valuable. And I think

1352
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,920
now you've just there was a question

1353
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,800
from Casper actually. I think you just

1354
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,119
put it on screen a minute ago. Um I

1355
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,079
think actually it's that one there.

1356
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,680
Awesome. And and it comes to that

1357
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,319
because I was reading that while you

1358
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,400
were talking and and you know, if I'm

1359
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,280
interpreting this correctly, you know,

1360
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,880
it's it's talking about the the

1361
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,720
challenges, the friction, the

1362
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,119
constraints, whatever words we want to

1363
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,160
use in the system. and and whether we

1364
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,160
you know we using scrum scrum or water

1365
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,040
agile or waggile or whatever we call

1366
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:26,079
these things in the old days dwords but

1367
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,839
um the the reality of it is and this is

1368
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,880
why I think what we've created

1369
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:34,720
collectively is so valuable because if

1370
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:37,520
you visualize how work gets done all

1371
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,160
that stuff is transparent and as Russ

1372
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,200
said earlier 100% transparency is

1373
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,119
crucial we can see it all and then we

1374
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,359
can start to ask questions and in the

1375
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,839
guide we talk about you know helping

1376
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,440
people to get the right answers more

1377
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,720
rapidly. There's language in there

1378
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,760
specifically um but essentially if you

1379
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,720
can see the workflow you understand

1380
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,920
every step of how you do the work this

1381
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,480
stuff becomes visible and you start to

1382
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,079
have the conversations to deal with it.

1383
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,760
And there is language in the guide and

1384
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,680
I'll I'll find that so we can pull it up

1385
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,119
in a minute. But I just wanted to sort

1386
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,440
of speak to this point because what

1387
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,079
Casper is saying is what drives people

1388
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,400
bonkers in the real world. But the

1389
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,119
answer to this is to make the work

1390
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,960
visible. Once you can see it, you can

1391
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,640
have a conversation about how to deal

1392
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,559
with it. And there is language in the

1393
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,720
guide specifically about that. John,

1394
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,960
I'll hand back to you. Yeah, thank you

1395
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,000
so much, Nigel. Uh there's a question

1396
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,079
from Ross actually. Um

1397
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,680
so who do we see as the audience for

1398
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,640
this? And uh maybe I'll go around the

1399
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,480
room on this actually. Um I'll uh you

1400
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,400
know I'll go to Martin first and to

1401
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,079
Michael and to Nigel and I'll give my

1402
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,160
own comments as well. But curious to

1403
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,599
hear your answers folks because uh we're

1404
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,359
all from different walks of life. So we

1405
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,079
have different perspectives. That's the

1406
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,200
whole uh fruit of the collaboration

1407
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,640
really. There's different perspectives.

1408
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,079
I'm very cur curious to hear your

1409
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,280
answers. Martin, what's your perspective

1410
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,280
on this? Yes. Unprepared response. I I

1411
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,720
think that

1412
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:14,160
um in in general for me the guide is a

1413
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,559
tool for practitioners

1414
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,119
to help them engage

1415
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,839
with other other people. I I think it's

1416
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,760
definitely a tool for everybody, right?

1417
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,400
But I don't think it's discoverable for

1418
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,280
everybody because how do you find it if

1419
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,800
you don't know it's there, right? it it

1420
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,440
and if you don't know that flow is your

1421
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,040
problem and most people and most teams

1422
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,960
don't know that flow is their problem.

1423
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,200
They don't understand what flow is. They

1424
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,200
don't understand there's a whole

1425
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,480
mathematical thing around flow that's

1426
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,880
not just making [Â __Â ] up. It's actually

1427
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,000
understanding mathematically how work

1428
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,000
flows through your system. And I feel

1429
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,680
like that this is a great guide for

1430
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,720
practitioners

1431
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,359
to use in reference

1432
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,680
to to Some of it is a little bit of

1433
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,440
lending credibility. Sometimes you need,

1434
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,440
you know, you know, we've we've all

1435
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,520
we've all been in this situ. I would I

1436
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,599
guess many people in the chat as well

1437
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,280
have all been in the situation where you

1438
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,839
go into an organization to tell them

1439
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,440
what they already know.

1440
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,440
And that that you're bringing a little

1441
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,520
bit of external credibility to that

1442
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,240
story. And if you just have one person

1443
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,000
talking about flow, if you just have one

1444
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,559
person using those words, and that's why

1445
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,440
it's so good that the guide is in

1446
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,280
layman's terms is in plain planer planer

1447
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,599
language than a lot of the reference

1448
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:40,720
material out there. Um that that you can

1449
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,960
point people to this guide. You can use

1450
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,520
the language that we're using in this

1451
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,839
guide to benefit the work that you're

1452
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,960
doing with with your customers. And

1453
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:55,839
I think that's for me is is is the core

1454
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,799
audience for this is practitioners and

1455
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:03,440
then they're they will use this in ways

1456
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:06,599
with their their practitiones. I don't

1457
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,599
know the

1458
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,559
story.

1459
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:14,079
Thank you Martin. Yeah, Michael, what's

1460
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:19,680
your perspective? Yeah, to me um I I see

1461
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:22,000
a very very um diff diverse uh audience

1462
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,359
could be the newbies, right, that might

1463
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,359
have read uh other guides and found hard

1464
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:31,200
to understand because there's a lot of

1465
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,119
unsaid or take taken for granted or even

1466
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,000
expert practitioners that would like to

1467
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,960
dive deep into something uh like you

1468
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,200
know tact just just just to mention one

1469
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,000
they might have heard it but I I never

1470
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,319
find a very simple and straightforward

1471
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,720
explanation of that and it's perfectly

1472
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,720
fine if it doesn't fit with your system

1473
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,040
but what it does and maybe you could

1474
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,200
decide to apply it and propose it but

1475
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,119
also as a conversation starter and

1476
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,520
something I really liked it is that

1477
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,799
whenever something is mentioned and is

1478
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,960
referring to something outside may it be

1479
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:08,160
uh systems thinking or other thing there

1480
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,440
are references so it's a starting point

1481
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,240
is allows you also to to build up a

1482
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,720
scaffolding system where you can start

1483
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,960
uh your your personal journey in in

1484
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,760
expanding your knowledge or use it with

1485
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:26,400
your team probably as a trainer can also

1486
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:28,640
be a a good uh element to to uh to

1487
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,559
sediment concept and and again as we

1488
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:36,880
said simplify the the language. So in

1489
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,880
short um the the the audience I think is

1490
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,559
wider than might have been probably

1491
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,400
before and this would also um make more

1492
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,359
people comfortable to say you know what

1493
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,920
I read this um I think might be

1494
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,839
interested for you rather than oh you're

1495
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,079
doing scrum now you should be doing

1496
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,960
kanban that's why right maybe there's

1497
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,119
these things that you can apply in in

1498
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,319
your current scenario it doesn't mean

1499
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:06,079
it's either or So yeah, probably the

1500
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:08,160
audience is is more wider than probably

1501
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,079
might have been intended for other

1502
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,079
guides before.

1503
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,280
Thank you so much, Michael. Nigel, very

1504
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,359
interested to hear your perspective as

1505
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,480
well. Sure. I like the word scaffolding

1506
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,640
that uh he just used because in some of

1507
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,720
my work on complexity and and stuff, we

1508
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,720
talk about scaffolding being a temporary

1509
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,720
structure we put in place to support

1510
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,640
learning, to support whatever we're

1511
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,480
trying to support. Some of it may stay

1512
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,559
permanently because it becomes part of

1513
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,839
the system or it others can be removed

1514
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:38,000
away. So for certainly

1515
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:42,160
uh anybody starting out trying to find

1516
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,040
the way to manage work may find some

1517
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,880
utility in what we've described when we

1518
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,160
talk about I'm going to flash up a

1519
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,720
couple of things and I posted some of

1520
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,079
the camb it came up as you so it looks

1521
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,760
like you're making these statements but

1522
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,920
that's good. These are copy paste from

1523
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,680
the guide. So if we read this, the

1524
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,599
strategy of Kambban system is to enable

1525
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,319
the the system members to ask the right

1526
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,960
questions sooner as part of a continuous

1527
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,440
improvement effort. And then later on we

1528
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,040
talk about as you mentioned early

1529
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,960
genbutsu

1530
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:13,200
uh which is the Japanese phrase which is

1531
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,960
go and see without assumptions

1532
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,200
understand what's really happening where

1533
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,400
the work is done and take action. And

1534
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,000
there's some words on there. I won't

1535
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,960
read it all out and people can read it

1536
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,359
and grab it off the the video later. But

1537
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,920
the whole point of this is so who is the

1538
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:31,839
guide for? Well, it's clearly for people

1539
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,720
that are starting out wanting to manage

1540
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:37,040
workflow in some way. Be it software, be

1541
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,720
it something else. It's clearly for

1542
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,400
people who want to visualize that

1543
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,400
workflow and understand where the

1544
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,000
opportunities for improvement are.

1545
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,079
Whether you call it kaizen or whatever

1546
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,799
or constraint management, it's there for

1547
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:53,359
you. But this says managers, leaders or

1548
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,280
people who call yourself a leader or who

1549
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:59,359
have characteristics of leadership who

1550
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,839
control work in a managerial way, then

1551
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,480
that's something that this guide

1552
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,640
suggests that you get involved with. My

1553
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,400
advice to people who start to use this

1554
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,119
to help them in in their work using

1555
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,480
camban type systems

1556
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:17,119
is to make that section visible. It's

1557
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,680
the improving flow section. Make that

1558
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:22,720
section visible to your leadership

1559
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:26,240
managers, people who tell you what to do

1560
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,640
so that they see they have a role. And

1561
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,960
if they read nothing else in the guide

1562
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,680
other than the statements about what is

1563
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,319
flow, what is value, demand management,

1564
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,880
they read that paragraph

1565
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:41,680
that will be valuable and will help us.

1566
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,599
So I think that primarily yes people who

1567
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,760
are using it and practicing it but

1568
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,280
people who are managing the process the

1569
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:50,799
system and the people who are practicing

1570
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,280
it need to be shown it so they can see

1571
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,920
where it's relevant for their role in

1572
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,720
helping the system improve.

1573
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,559
Thank you, Nigel. And uh I'm not going

1574
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,680
to uh duplicate what's a lot of been

1575
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,000
said. I agree with everything that's

1576
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,640
been said by by by my colleagues here.

1577
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,240
Uh my own kind of lens on life is

1578
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,119
coherence.

1579
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:14,880
And so we we can have uh canban system

1580
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,240
members doing great things. Um and if

1581
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,839
you think about it, what we have in this

1582
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,359
guide is really a coping strategy for

1583
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,280
all the craziness that goes around goes

1584
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,559
around. If you have a team, all the

1585
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,319
craziness that goes around, the

1586
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,960
overwhelm of too many things being

1587
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:28,559
started in the organization and and if

1588
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,000
you think about it in scrum, the product

1589
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,359
backlog is a coping strategy for all the

1590
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,280
nonsense. You only bring in what you

1591
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,880
want when you can bring it in. And

1592
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,400
similar here with the open guide to

1593
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,960
kamban as well. And there's lots of

1594
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,160
strategies uh for for for dealing with

1595
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,000
that. Um I think one of the things that

1596
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,559
Nigel talked about is really close to my

1597
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,720
heart as well which is uh how can we

1598
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,640
make sure that there's more

1599
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,880
understanding about what's really

1600
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,400
happening in the system and some people

1601
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,640
talk about you know it's okay to be on

1602
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,160
the balcony as a manager and there's a

1603
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,079
lot of merit in that you can see what's

1604
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,440
going on but there's also a lot of merit

1605
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,599
as well in just getting down on the

1606
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,640
floor rolling up your sleeves and

1607
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,079
putting on your Wellington boots

1608
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,720
metaphorically and understanding what's

1609
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,319
really happening because uh you'll often

1610
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,040
find that you're asking the team's you

1611
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:15,520
know saying I want more uh I want it now

1612
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,839
and I want the quality up but actually

1613
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,480
uh is that coherent and so this guide is

1614
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:23,440
trying to uh do a couple of things is

1615
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,880
trying to help people who are not in any

1616
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,640
of the existing canban communities or

1617
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,480
flow communities they're not even aware

1618
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,760
of this they think canban is when you

1619
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,319
don't want to do anything else you just

1620
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,559
visualize crap on a wall forgive my

1621
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:36,319
language so we're trying to say well

1622
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,319
it's not that actually it's uh that

1623
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:40,079
there's there are some minimums there's

1624
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,240
not a lot that you have to do in this

1625
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,520
guide if you're going to use canban but

1626
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,799
uh we're trying to say actually this is

1627
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:48,000
what we really mean and we're trying to

1628
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:49,520
reach beyond so it's an open guide so

1629
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,799
we're trying to reach beyond so that

1630
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,839
we're using language that we think

1631
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,000
everybody understand you don't have to

1632
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,920
be a canban nerd we hope to understand

1633
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,920
what's in the guide we've also got lots

1634
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,880
of definitions and if you disagree with

1635
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,480
anything of course you know you can

1636
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,160
debate with us in the discussions and we

1637
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,559
can we can do a follow-up and so on so

1638
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,079
for me it's about coherence so what are

1639
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:09,039
the camp system members dealing with

1640
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:11,200
also if there are managers is what are

1641
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,359
doing coherent as well with what's going

1642
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,520
on in that exactly. It's not just a

1643
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,880
board full of post-it notes uh and Jura

1644
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,200
and so on. It's that's not really what

1645
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,839
we're talking about. It's about having a

1646
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:23,839
balanced system, a balance between

1647
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:25,920
capacity and demand. And we've got lots

1648
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:29,039
of suggestions on how we deal with that

1649
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,440
as well. So yeah, I also want to bring

1650
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,119
uh some attention as well to some of the

1651
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,599
people that we'd like to acknowledge as

1652
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:40,079
well uh because uh this is a fork of uh

1653
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,240
KMAN guide May 2025 version which I was

1654
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:44,400
involved in of course and there's many

1655
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:47,200
people who uh were involved in all of

1656
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,960
these uh different uh versions and

1657
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,319
history and so on and they deserve

1658
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,640
credit. A lot of them don't want to be

1659
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,680
named and I understand why. Uh but there

1660
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,400
are some people who were happy to be

1661
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,799
named at the time. For example, the July

1662
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,319
and December 2020 versions of Kambang

1663
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:04,240
Guide. We had John John Paul Bailey, uh

1664
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:06,799
Jose Cassal, Colleen Johnson, Todd

1665
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,000
Miller, Eric Neabberg, Steve Porter,

1666
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:12,559
Ryan Ripley, Dave West, uh Julia Wester,

1667
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,480
Uvalure, and Deborah Zanki as well who

1668
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,400
was involved in editing uh that

1669
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,559
document. Uh we were driving poor

1670
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,079
Deborah crazy, I remember. uh but it was

1671
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,480
really cool working with Deborah and

1672
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,559
very grateful for that. Then we have the

1673
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,960
May 2025 version where there were some

1674
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,280
additional reviewers including for for

1675
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,880
example Mike Delena Furlit, Tom Gilb,

1676
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,599
Colleen Johnson, Christian Neverdal,

1677
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:37,119
Pratik Singh, Steve Tendon and Julia

1678
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,400
Wester and uh we had more uh reviewers

1679
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,319
than this but the people who were happy

1680
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,280
to be named for the open guide to canban

1681
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,760
were Jim Benson, Andy Carmichael, Jose

1682
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,079
Cassal, Magdalena Furllet who said hello

1683
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,640
to us earlier, Michael Forny who was

1684
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,480
here, Martin Helwood who was here,

1685
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,319
Christian never has at a Guns and Roses

1686
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,760
concert and I really I think that's a

1687
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,680
good decision much better than being

1688
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,079
here and but he would love to have been

1689
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,640
here today. Nadart Talai as well who's

1690
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,480
been a mentor of mine actually he intro

1691
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,880
he reintroduced me to Kanban believe it

1692
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:10,720
or not in 2015 I kind of dismissed it a

1693
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,880
bit 2010 2011 thought yeah whatever and

1694
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,200
uh N brought me back to the to the

1695
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,039
trough so to speak and Andy gave me a

1696
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,280
lot of mentoring as well so very

1697
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,599
grateful for their their uh putting me

1698
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,440
on the right path. Steve Tendon, if

1699
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,720
anybody remembers during the pandemic

1700
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,559
all these live streams, everybody was

1701
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,039
bored. I was doing loads of live streams

1702
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,160
and I think we did uh 10 hours of video

1703
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,599
with Steve Tendon and uh and Nigel who's

1704
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,160
here as well, of course, and many other

1705
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,680
people, many in many many influences,

1706
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,599
people who probably don't want to be

1707
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,359
named here at all. Very fed up that we

1708
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,559
even named them. How dare you? What

1709
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:44,480
we're saying here is look, people who

1710
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,760
are acknowledged here do not necessarily

1711
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,079
agree with what's written in this

1712
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,720
document, and that's okay. We still owe

1713
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,960
them um a massive debt of gratitude and

1714
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,400
we're very very grateful to everybody

1715
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,359
who was involved. It was a very very

1716
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,640
intensive review the last few weeks that

1717
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,640
I think it's been about three weeks that

1718
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,559
we've been working on this roughly. You

1719
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,640
know John I think it's an incredible

1720
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:09,280
achievement to get Steve Tendon and

1721
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:14,240
myself in the same document agreeing. So

1722
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:16,720
I'm sure I'm just go on and it's open so

1723
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:20,240
anybody can can come and disagree with

1724
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,799
us and submit their suggestions discuss

1725
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:25,520
collaborate with everybody else and and

1726
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:28,319
figure out what's next. No, I agree

1727
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:30,079
John. I think we're at that time. We are

1728
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,079
indeed. Yeah. Just one comment on

1729
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,400
Casper's things there. So he said

1730
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:36,720
evolutionary. Yes, that's its bias. That

1731
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,359
tends to be its natural stance. you that

1732
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,520
doesn't stop you from doing big changes.

1733
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,200
Um so if you're in a situation where you

1734
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,839
have what I call layer cake teams you

1735
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,760
know uh if you're an IT back backend

1736
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:49,760
middleware front end dependency hell all

1737
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,599
that maybe you realize after a while

1738
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,880
maybe we need to restructure you know so

1739
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,880
like we're saying you might need to do

1740
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,280
that depends on your school of thought

1741
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,880
and so on where you come from um there

1742
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,319
could be other things as well maybe the

1743
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,240
performance management systems need to

1744
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,440
change maybe the finance systems need to

1745
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,119
change because the way we're budgeting

1746
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,359
and so on. So we're kind of hinting at

1747
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,839
that as well in this document. So it's

1748
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:11,920
actually not all small changes. So we

1749
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:14,240
think actually uh we could use canban

1750
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,000
for doing something much more as well.

1751
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,839
So yeah, thank you every very much

1752
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,400
everyone for joining in the discussion

1753
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:22,560
today. Uh I think what I'd like to do

1754
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,560
now is go around the table for the final

1755
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,920
words and I'll start with Martin again.

1756
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,880
Poor Martin is always getting stuck the

1757
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,359
first time then we go to Michael and uh

1758
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,640
and Nigel uh to maybe close us out

1759
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,679
today. Thank you so much gentlemen.

1760
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,319
Martin over to you. I I want I want to

1761
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,359
to to reiterate just just based on a few

1762
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,839
of the comments that um KBAN and scrum

1763
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:46,159
are not at odds with each other. They

1764
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:48,560
are complimentary practices. They work

1765
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:50,799
together really well and you you may or

1766
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,600
may not like scrum, right? That's

1767
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:57,600
perfectly okay. Um, but they they

1768
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:59,279
definitely um I don't have a single

1769
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,440
scrum team I've ever worked with that I

1770
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:04,560
don't also recommend looking at and

1771
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:06,640
using flow metrics and flow uh uh

1772
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,799
monitoring and understanding your flow.

1773
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:13,679
And I think it's uh great that if you

1774
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:16,319
want to translate the guide, if you want

1775
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,319
to be involved in that process, not just

1776
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,159
making changes to the guide, you you

1777
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,839
might not have anything you want to

1778
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:24,319
change you, but you want to contribute

1779
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:25,600
in some way. Perhaps you could try help

1780
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,759
translating the guide into another

1781
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,000
language. Perhaps you could just

1782
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,920
participate in conversation and

1783
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,440
discussion. If you don't see the

1784
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,159
conversation,

1785
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,000
if you've thought of it, like writing a

1786
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:40,319
blog post, right? If you've thought of

1787
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,679
it, probably somebody else has got that

1788
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:46,080
problem, too. So, ask that question. Um,

1789
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,560
and collaborate on on figuring out what

1790
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,640
works well.

1791
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,080
Uh, thank you, Martin. Michael, over to

1792
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:57,199
you, please. Yep. For me, I think is an

1793
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:59,040
invitation uh to start a journey. That's

1794
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:01,280
not the end of the journey. That's the

1795
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,280
start of the journey. Even if uh you

1796
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,199
think you're an expert, even if you

1797
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,560
think you've discovered everything, uh

1798
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,880
this gives you a fresh reread and you

1799
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,440
can validate your thoughts or question

1800
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:16,640
them, introduce a little bit of value,

1801
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,560
array and maybe thinking out of the box

1802
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,600
is just for software. is not is for

1803
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,239
systems and and the people people go

1804
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:27,920
back into right what I really love about

1805
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:30,640
KBAN is that you ask people to make

1806
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,840
those changes that can improve their own

1807
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,719
life every day right make that change be

1808
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,800
be vocal observe that's why transparent

1809
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,040
100% so if you see something that

1810
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,640
doesn't look right raise your hand and

1811
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:46,239
let's change it together so the human

1812
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,760
side to me I think is very very

1813
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,000
important so the journey and the human

1814
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,560
side. Thanks. Thank you so much,

1815
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,880
Michael. Nigel, over to you, please. Um,

1816
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,800
I've said so much on this uh broadcast,

1817
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,360
but I think that this is an invitation

1818
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,760
for people to participate. I think it's

1819
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,360
an opportunity for them to to learn

1820
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,840
things. I think it's an opportunity for

1821
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,000
them to apply some of the thinking and

1822
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,239
and ultimately to understand that all

1823
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,880
we're trying to do with flow as it says

1824
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:16,960
in the guide is is to foster a smooth

1825
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:21,360
and balanced system to create value.

1826
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,440
This will help you in that direction.

1827
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,760
Thank you so much Nigel. Really

1828
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:28,320
appreciate uh you coming on today and

1829
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,560
thank you everyone uh for who

1830
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,880
contributed uh to the document. Uh,

1831
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,960
thank you for all your comments today,

1832
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,520
Martin. Thank you so much for getting us

1833
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,960
set up on the website. We were uh on the

1834
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,239
website a lot today, weren't we, Martin?

1835
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,840
And Martin's been doing lots of things

1836
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:44,320
in the background. Absolute hero. Thank

1837
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,920
you so much. You always ask me just in

1838
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,480
time.

1839
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,320
Yeah, sorry about that. We were still

1840
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,440
finalizing the document this morning.

1841
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:56,159
Okay. Yeah.

1842
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,159
So, and uh Nigel, thank you so much for

1843
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,760
uh for being willing to collaborate.

1844
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:02,239
Yeah. Our conversations haven't always

1845
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,280
been easy and uh yeah, big respect to

1846
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:08,159
you for uh for finding a way to to work

1847
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,320
with us on this and and to find a way to

1848
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,840
help people actually and uh there's lots

1849
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,679
of arguments going on on social media,

1850
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,040
but we can get together sometimes. We

1851
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,040
can agree on some things, can't we? We

1852
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,960
can find a way to help people and really

1853
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,080
appreciate the uh the coherence that you

1854
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,560
brought as well from a Toyota

1855
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,239
perspective and the the challenge that

1856
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,760
you gave us as well during this whole

1857
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:29,600
collaboration as well. Really appreciate

1858
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,440
that. And uh Michael, your reviews all

1859
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,520
the way through this as detailed as

1860
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,199
ever. I really appreciate you. You

1861
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,600
helped me as well with a a recent guide

1862
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,120
as well. And uh this one, your feedback

1863
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,840
has been phenomenal. I really enjoyed,

1864
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,880
by the way, working with uh with Michael

1865
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,679
on retro Lego serious play. Anytime I do

1866
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,600
a PSM class for scrum.org in London in

1867
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,520
person, Nigel uh not Nigel, sorry.

1868
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,880
Michael turns up and because Nigel was

1869
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:55,199
talking about Lego earlier, that's why

1870
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,880
he had a Freudian slip. So, Michael uh

1871
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,800
turns up and does his thing and it's

1872
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,000
amazing and he helps my training to get

1873
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,600
better and uh and uh he's helped me a

1874
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,960
lot actually over the last couple of

1875
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,840
years. So, I really really appreciate

1876
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:10,800
and for everybody involved. The document

1877
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,840
is there. It's for you to to look at. Uh

1878
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,520
and uh we hope you enjoy it and uh and

1879
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,000
if there's anything that you want us to

1880
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,239
improve, please let us know. Uh it's

1881
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,239
collaborative. Uh there'll be lots of

1882
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,440
discussions. Sometimes there'll be a

1883
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,199
little bit too much noise going on

1884
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,120
because remember we're people who have a

1885
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,280
day job as well and you know this isn't

1886
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,480
uh being funded by some major corporate

1887
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,560
or anything like that. This is like just

1888
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,239
a few people getting together. We'll do

1889
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,640
the best we can. Sometimes what we do is

1890
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:37,760
we write long form articles to just try

1891
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,960
to make sure that when we're having

1892
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,960
debates about things that we're talking

1893
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:42,480
about the same thing and we invite

1894
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,440
people to calls as well. So when we feel

1895
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,679
there's a little bit of friction going

1896
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,520
on, we'd like to set up some Teams calls

1897
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,400
or Zoom calls or whatever to whatever

1898
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,560
platform you're using so that uh we can

1899
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,840
kind of understand your perspective more

1900
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,800
because sometimes it gets that gets

1901
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,719
lost. Nuance gets lost a bit sometimes.

1902
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,280
Yeah, Gary was there as well when he was

1903
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,840
trained as well as one of Michael's

1904
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,600
retro Lego serious play uh trainer. So

1905
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,679
yeah, thank you everyone for joining.

1906
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,679
So, thank you Nigel, thank you uh

1907
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,000
Martin, thank you Michael, thank you

1908
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,520
everybody for being here and we hope you

1909
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,280
enjoy the document. We hope you find it

1910
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,080
useful and if there's something you

1911
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,480
don't like, join the discussion and uh

1912
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,239
maybe join the discussion before you uh

1913
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,920
go on social media. I had a recent

1914
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,760
document. Oh, I am only halfway through

1915
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,880
the document. I just like to say well

1916
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,719
maybe you should finish reading the

1917
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,239
document or or I haven't read the

1918
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:33,120
document yet but this is what I think.

1919
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,120
Um no yeah I got one of those the other

1920
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:37,280
day as well.

1921
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,520
So read the document please. This is

1922
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,920
shorter. It's uh it's manageable. So you

1923
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,360
know just go through it and uh we put a

1924
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,520
lot of thought into it. So if there's

1925
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,000
something wrong the best place to talk

1926
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,960
about improving it is on the site.

1927
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,480
There's a join the discussion section.

1928
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:54,719
That's a much better place much more

1929
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,920
constructive than you know getting

1930
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,040
clicks and all that kind of stuff in

1931
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,199
social media. And you can still get the

1932
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:01,520
clicks by the way because what you've

1933
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,199
probably noticed already is that there

1934
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,600
are contributors already on the site.

1935
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,320
And so people who contribute

1936
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,239
get recognition. So they're you uh you

1937
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,560
contribute something you're also a

1938
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:15,360
contributor to the stockman. So uh you

1939
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:17,120
know that's a healthy way to maybe help

1940
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,440
the community. Uh there's there's too

1941
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,840
much arguing. Let's let's try and help

1942
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,719
people fix problems and let's try to win

1943
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,719
not win arguments. So thanks everyone

1944
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,560
and uh yeah we'll leave you there and

1945
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,320
thank you so much for your time and

1946
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:34,239
looking forward to hearing what you

1947
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,239
think. Thank you so much everyone.

1948
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,640
Thanks.
