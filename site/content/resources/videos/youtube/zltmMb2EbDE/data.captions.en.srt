1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,919
the question is does cban integrate with

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:12,240
a scrum environment and I I I want to be

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,679
super clear hban integrates with any

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,039
environment any way of working whether

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,800
you're doing scrum or you're doing

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,680
waterfall or you just made up a way of

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:29,560
working all of these things can benefit

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,920
from the application of a cand strategy

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,840
right

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:39,440
the the scrum in particular doesn't have

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,800
any metrics there are no no metrics in

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,920
scrum go read the cang guide there is no

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,600
mention of velocity no mention of story

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,160
points no mention of time no mention of

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,399
any of those things the only thing

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,519
that's about as close to a metric as the

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,680
scrum guide talks about is it it says

18
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,879
that um uh the team should have

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,799
discussions to understand the size of

20
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,119
things that are in their backlog that's

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,360
it right how you define that size all of

22
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:16,799
those things are are are are up to up to

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,680
the team teams generally pick things

24
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,520
like story points and velocity and

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,400
unfortunately those metrics have damaged

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,720
our ability as an industry building

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
software industry in particular damaged

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,159
our ability as an industry to have

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,799
conversations with customers have them

30
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,159
understand what we're saying and be able

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,560
to actually answer the customer

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,040
questions it is absolutely

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,159
unreasonable for a customer to come to

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,920
you has given you and your team a bunch

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,320
of money and says when will it be done

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,040
and you say we're doing scrum we don't

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,280
have an answer to that question that is

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,240
completely unreasonable and if I was

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
that person I would say fine I'm not

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,680
giving you any more money I'll go find

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479
somebody else who can answer my

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,719
questions right

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,600
so

44
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:07,520
caman a caman strategy enables you to

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
actually answer those

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,840
questions right you're definitely not

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
answering it with absolutes right

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
because that's impossible we understand

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
the cone of uncertainty we understand uh

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,040
uh uh that those difficulties but we can

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,000
start to use probabilistic

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,560
forecasting fantastic tool probabilistic

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,879
forecasting to help us answer those

54
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,640
questions of when will it be done or

55
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,440
what will I get by this date right these

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,560
are these are such important questions

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,480
uh Daniel Vante who's one of the the the

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,319
creators of uh uh Pro caman uh the

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,920
creator of the caman strategy um who who

60
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:52,319
worked with scrum.org to create the cban

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,280
guide for scrum teams and uh H caman for

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,120
scrum teams

63
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,840
course he has a book called when will it

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,920
be done that's how important that

65
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,239
question is to your business business

66
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,360
you need to be able to to answer that

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:10,319
question when will it be done and the

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,159
tools that cban gives you the metrics

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
that you have to monitor enable you to

70
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,159
then get those answers to those

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,560
questions very specifically right um so

72
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,480
does cban integrate with a scrum

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,560
environment I think cban has to

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,319
integrate with a scrum environment in

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,680
fact scrum is not not as good without a

76
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,920
caman strategy i i i i for

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,680
me this is this is a pairing that that

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,879
that is just has to happen if you doing

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,920
scrum you should be using a caman

80
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:55,120
strategy um I don't really have any

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,599
um what would you call it like well

82
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,879
maybe you should use no you should be

83
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,000
using a cban strategy everybody should

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,720
for every system in every workplace

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,480
everywhere you should be using a cand

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,159
strategy that's how you understand the

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,519
flow of work through your system so that

88
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,959
you can make the optimizations right

89
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,239
that's where you get the continuous

90
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,840
improvement from when you're doing

91
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,759
scrum right you you you have a

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,840
retrospective how how do you how do you

93
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,560
know what optimizations you should make

94
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,880
how do you have convers ations about

95
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,400
what the problem is if you've got no

96
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,800
data how do you um um see whether the

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,039
things that you've decided to try

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,840
actually provide any benefit or not you

99
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:51,080
need metrics and you need data and story

100
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:54,960
points and velocity and burndown charts

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,720
are completely useless to answer any of

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,600
those

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,600
questions are we on track are we doing

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,320
well do we need to improve none of those

105
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
questions can be answered with burndown

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,360
charts and velocity don't even try

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
they're a waste of time what you need is

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,960
cycle

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,560
time you need lead time and you need

110
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,039
throughput you need work item aging and

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,440
you need work in process that's

112
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,680
it those are the metrics that you're

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,319
looking for those are the metrics that

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,000
you need if your current system of work

115
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,520
is failing you then you would benefit

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,720
from CRE creating and applying a caman

117
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,240
strategy our professional cand trainers

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,759
and Consultants are ready to help don't

119
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,160
wait the sooner you start the sooner you

120
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,160
will improve get in touch below
