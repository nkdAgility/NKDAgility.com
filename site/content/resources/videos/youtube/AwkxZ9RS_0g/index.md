## Synergy Between Consulting and Training

Today's topic question is my personal favourite: "How does my consulting experience manifest in the training environment?"

For me, this is a subject that unearths the core of what effective training should be, and I'm excited to delve into it.Â  ðŸ“š

## Twin Pillars: Consulting and Training

When I'm consulting and training, it manifests itself all over the place, to be honest.

This synergy isn't just a coincidenceâ€”it's fundamental. Training is far more than lecturing on textbook solutions.

It's a unique space where particular instances, ideas, and solutions spring to life. ðŸŽ¯

## The Power of Situational Experience

I feel that I bring to a training class the situational experiences I've had with organisations, teams, and leadership groups.Â  ðŸŒŸ

These aren't just tales or fables; these are real-life lived experiences. Through these authentic situational accounts, the training process gains its full measure of value and relatability.

## Always a Worse Story

Without fail, I've always got a worse story than whatever the students bring, and that's a strength. It lightens the atmosphere, enabling open and candid discussions.

Whether it's a technical dilemma, a cultural hurdle, or a business obstacle, I can pull out a worse example.Â  ðŸ˜‚

## Why Realness in Training Is Not Negotiable

What differentiates my training classes is that they centre around real experiences.

It's a simple but powerful criterion: trainers have to have actually done what they're talking about.

This hands-on perspective, rooted in real consulting experience, transforms the training content into an engaging and profoundly impactful resource.

## losing the Gap: From Theory to Real-World Application

We talk about Agile and Scrum in training, but companies are often far removed from these principles. Â Â 

So, how do we close this chasm?

How do we go from theory to real-world applications?

Surprisingly, the answer is straightforward: a trainer with a substantial Agile or DevOps consulting background.
