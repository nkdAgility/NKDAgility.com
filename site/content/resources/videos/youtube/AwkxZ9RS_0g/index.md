# How does your consulting experience manifest in the training environment?

There's an old saying, 'those who can't, teach!' and it gained popularity because the majority of teachers had little to no experience in doing the work. They simply read the theory, and learned how to teach that theory to others.

Is that helpful? In the context of #agile and #scrum, certainly not. You need to have lived and breathed these values and principles. You need to have done the work. You need to have overcome several challenges. You need to be an expert if you are going to teach others.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how his working experience, as an expert in the field, translates into teaching and empowering people in the classroom.
