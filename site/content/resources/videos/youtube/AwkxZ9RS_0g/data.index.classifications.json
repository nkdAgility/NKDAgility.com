    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on the value of human consulting experience in enhancing training effectiveness, particularly in Agile, Scrum, and DevOps contexts. There is no mention or discussion of human-AI collaboration, AI agent involvement, or any collective intelligence concepts as defined. Training examples and experiential anecdotes fall solely within human-to-human learning. The intended audience is practitioners interested in real-world Agile and Scrum training, not those seeking human-AI or socio-technical partnership insights. Apart from brief Agile and DevOps references, there are no conceptual, practical, or even implicit connections to Collective Intelligence as per the category definition. The content's purpose is to market consultant-led training based on human experience, not to explore human-AI cognition, partnership, or emergent problem-solving. Therefore, all scores are extremely low, with only slightly higher ratings for intent and audience relevance due to the Agile context.",

The content focuses on bridging consulting and training through real-world examples, mainly discussing effective pedagogy and relevance, not the deliberate design of engineering practices or systems to empower agency. Even mentions of Agile, Scrum, and DevOps aim to establish practical teaching credibility, not agentic development principles. The intended audience is practitioners but not specifically those interested in agentic frameworks. Signal-to-noise ratio is low as the main discussion is tangential to the target category.",
