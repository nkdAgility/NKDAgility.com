1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,080
how does my Consulting experience

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,139
manifest in the training environment I

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,000
think it manifests itself all over the

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,220
place to be honest when I'm when I'm

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,340
when I'm Consulting when I'm training so

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,260
much so that I I definitely

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,380
quite often

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,019
struggle to cover all of the content

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,180
that we want to talk about because

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,520
for most people

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,380
they're they're coming to training

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,480
looking for answers

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,920
right it might not be the answers that

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,420
the training was designed to give them

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,980
right

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,579
um that's that's that's also often the

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,100
case but if we do have time and we do

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,239
have inclination and even sometimes if

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,700
we don't

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,399
it's worth having a conversation about

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,340
particular instances in particular ideas

22
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,620
and particular Solutions and one of the

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,600
things that I feel that I bring to a

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,780
training class

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,700
um that folks that aren't actually

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,680
Consulting haven't actually been

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,180
Consultants kind of aren't able to

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,260
Leverage is those situational

29
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,560
experiences that I've had in

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,799
organizations with teams with leadership

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,140
groups where we're trying to figure out

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,299
how to solve a problem and they they're

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,240
they're doing some crazy thing I think I

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,119
think my favorite thing that I talk

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,040
about a lot is I've always got a worse

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,880
story than whatever the students bring

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,700
right I've I can for I don't think I've

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,079
ever encountered a circumstance where a

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,759
student has brought up some crazy

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,400
nefarious ridiculous thing that their

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,040
organization does to inhibit their

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,880
ability to add deliver value

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,899
that I can't pull out an example of a

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,259
worse one right of a a team or an

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:05,340
organization that is just

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:08,280
just worse right and and almost in

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,979
almost every circumstance from technical

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,560
things that are worse from cultural

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,959
things that are worse to to actual

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,660
implementation things in the way they

51
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,000
they do business that inhibits the

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,220
ability for for for teams and

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,599
organizations to actually get value and

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,520
you'd think that would be something they

55
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,860
would want right

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,879
um and I think that's that's the piece

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,520
that that differentiates

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,680
um nicodilities training from other

59
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,200
training classes and it's something that

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,120
I look for in all of the trainers that I

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,160
work with

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,680
um is that they they have to have

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,819
actually actually done the things that

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,379
they're talking about I don't think

65
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,540
there's any value in having a trainer

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,700
that has that that is just a trainer

67
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,280
right that's that's so that's somebody

68
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,379
parroting the content or parroting the

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,300
ideas that that somebody else has

70
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,700
written they actually has to have

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,739
understood them and lived them so that

72
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,900
they can not only tell you here's what

73
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,900
this thing is supposed to be

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,260
but also say but I understand that

75
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,900
you're over here and here's how I have

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,239
seen organizations

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,739
either split that difference do

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,159
something differently that gets them as

79
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,640
as good there as they can or perhaps

80
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,920
even an organization that has thrown out

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
their existing system in order to move

82
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,620
to that new system and what that meant

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,360
for the business and the types of of

84
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,239
conversations that had to be had so that

85
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,420
the students feel like it's possible

86
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,879
right that's the bit that quite often

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,239
there's a huge difference between the

88
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,220
agile and scrum and lean and kanban that

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,379
we talk about in training

90
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,599
and where companies actually are and

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,340
people find it very difficult to to

92
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,900
understand how do they how do they close

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,720
that Gap

94
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,060
um and that's what a trainer with real

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,379
experience as an agile or devops

96
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,379
consultant brings to the story
