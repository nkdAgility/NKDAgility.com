1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,080
well that's a great question what are

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,080
hierarchies of competence

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,179
versus hierarchies of control and why

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,080
does it matter

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,300
well the hmm let's define each one so a

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,000
hierarchy of control

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,900
is where everybody's

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,519
told what to do usually obviously in a

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,980
hierarchy right because it's hierarchies

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,500
of control but you've you've got um the

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,620
traditional organizational structure

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,079
the pyramid right you've got the small

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,780
number of people at the top that are the

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,219
thinkers right the deciders

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,200
and then you get the majority of people

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,120
at the bottom who are the doers

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,160
and steering

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,120
flows down right

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,699
so in order for uh uh

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,320
um something to be decided

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,539
right there needs to be some kind of

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,800
trigger that a decision needs made and

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,180
sometimes that's just going to come from

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,920
the top because the person at the top

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,080
has an idea and everybody shall follow

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,760
it right everybody shall do it

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,220
um but sometimes it's a market trigger

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,960
right and when it's a market trigger

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,880
this is hierarchies of control in a

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,979
market trigger you've got the the the

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,080
markets are actually at the bottom the

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,400
people talking directly to the markets

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
are not the people at the top they're

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,100
the people at the bottom they're talking

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,780
to the shareholders right which is a

36
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,759
different sort of Market but who are

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,840
talking to your to your actual Market of

38
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,880
your customers

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,520
so there's some kind of trigger and it

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,979
has to be important enough that this

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,900
person who has no Authority whatsoever

42
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,920
and maybe doesn't give a crap right

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,439
because they're just doing what they're

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,560
told it has to be painful enough for

45
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,740
this person that they filter that up

46
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,119
to the next level right and then it

47
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,979
needs to be painful enough for that

48
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,020
person above I.E there's enough people

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,180
below giving that feedback that they're

50
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,680
like oh I need to escalate this and then

51
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,140
it escalates and it escalates and

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,119
escalation is is the word to watch out

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,380
for right so we're managing by

54
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,079
escalation

55
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,180
you've got this item this problem is

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,340
escalated up the chain until it gets to

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,140
somebody who for want of a better

58
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,120
expression this is how my dad phrased it

59
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,120
you get to somebody who it's beneath

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,040
them to deal with your problem right and

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,739
they just say to somebody below them

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,900
just fix it I don't care right just fix

63
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,160
it or they just make a decision and it

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,720
doesn't matter whether it's the right or

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,580
wrong decision nobody cares they just

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,379
make one right because at that level

67
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,200
they're not connected to the environment

68
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,239
and so I worked at Merrill Lynch for a

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,860
few years and before it was bought over

70
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,540
by Bank of America so Bank of America

71
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,520
Merrill Lynch now but

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,239
um there were there were 16 people

73
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,599
between me and the CEO

74
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,640
how long do you think it would take in

75
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,000
that pyramidal structure for that

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,220
trigger to get all the way to the top a

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,379
decision to be made and then that to

78
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,180
filter all the way down and remember it

79
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,160
has to be the same message that filters

80
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,660
down to the bottom which is never the

81
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,280
case because you know politics happens

82
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,260
in here as well

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,080
so that's that's a that's hierarchies of

84
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,819
control you're you're maximizing the

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,280
amount of time it takes for a a signal a

86
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,680
message to get to the person who needs

87
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,000
to act action it and then and then for

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,300
the change come on we'll be back down

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,239
and and that was great when

90
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,400
we were in the industrial revolution

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,300
right where these these practices came

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,459
from where in fact the the Mantra is

93
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,200
slow and steady wins the race right

94
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,700
would be would be the watchword of the

95
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,680
day because the customers aren't

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,019
changing their mind all the time the

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,640
customers aren't exposed to a hundred

98
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,340
different companies doing the same thing

99
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,200
and then picking that you're making the

100
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,500
product that they are buying end of

101
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,780
story right perhaps really really really

102
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,239
rich people could afford to import a

103
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,940
product from somewhere else in the world

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,739
um but otherwise it's all all kind of

105
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,440
more local

106
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,659
um um industry right you you if you want

107
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,580
a ship and you're a shipping company you

108
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,040
go to your local Shipyard in Glasgow if

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,140
you're in Glasgow or perhaps Southampton

110
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,700
but you're not gonna buy a ship from a

111
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,439
shipyard in China right that doesn't

112
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,720
make any sense whatsoever you would even

113
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,400
know that Shipyard existed right no

114
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,340
marketing no Communications at that

115
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,400
level so so so that's hierarchies of

116
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,220
control work great then but today with

117
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,880
the speed of Market change right because

118
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,740
there are no static markets anymore you

119
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,419
need this decision process to be much

120
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,479
much quicker

121
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,180
so hierarchies of competence

122
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,120
are about kind of I guess kind of

123
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,820
flipping on its head while still having

124
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,940
a little bit of hierarchy because kinda

125
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:51,380
uh there I I believe that there's

126
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,120
definitely a human need for for for

127
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,240
hierarchy right

128
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,680
um any time you see a group of people

129
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,720
who are challenged to complete some task

130
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,600
whether it's here's a pile of ropes and

131
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,199
stuff across that river right they're

132
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,139
going to you're going to have

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,639
leaders that emerge

134
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:20,040
based on their understanding or ability

135
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,180
within that particular context right so

136
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,340
if you gave the same group of people

137
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,800
another task it might be a different

138
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,500
leader that emerges

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,259
based on the context that they're in

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,620
that would be a hierarchy created based

141
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:38,940
on competence I choose to succeed

142
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,220
succeed secede succeed some of my

143
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,560
control over what it is we're doing to

144
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,180
you so that we can all collaborate

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,479
together to get to the outcome that we

146
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,460
desire and I'm Deli I am choosing to

147
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
secede that control to you because I

148
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,720
believe you are the most competent

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,419
person to do it and you'll see in larger

150
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,020
groups of people there might be multiple

151
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:03,720
different competing ideas for how to

152
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,940
solve the problem and perhaps you'll end

153
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,740
up with two groups of people with two

154
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,780
leaders that are both trying to solve in

155
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,220
different ways and then you see which is

156
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,840
the better outcome or the quicker

157
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,280
outcome more of the more optimal outcome

158
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,440
right

159
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,960
um and and that's just a natural thing

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,979
that we do so the fundamental difference

161
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,800
between hierarchies of control is

162
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,479
in hierarchies of control you as an

163
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,020
individual

164
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,300
um don't choose to follow you are

165
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,860
enforced to follow a specific person

166
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,620
even if you think they're the most

167
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,080
incompetent idiot in the world

168
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,000
um and in that model you actually

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,520
there's an expression that you hear a

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,620
lot which is promoted to their level of

171
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,780
incompetence you heard that expression

172
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,360
that's that's just fits perfectly with

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,539
that model because somebody is seen to

174
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,979
be good at doing a job and then they

175
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,780
promote them to the next level up and

176
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,639
maybe the next level up is All About

177
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,919
Management and has nothing to do with

178
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,479
actually doing the same job and now

179
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,300
they're not good at it but you never

180
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,400
demote people you only promote people

181
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,259
so then they never get promoted again so

182
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,539
they've been promoted to their level of

183
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,539
incompetence one level down they're

184
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:18,180
awesome this level up they suck right

185
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,979
and so you end up with these massive

186
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,380
management structures and organizations

187
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,940
because you've promoted this person to

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,139
the level of incompetence and oh crap

189
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,580
they're not actually doing their job so

190
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,440
we need to find somebody else so we

191
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,840
promote this other person I know they're

192
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,400
actually good at it so out of how many

193
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,020
people at that level

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
how many people are actually useful

195
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,919
that's that hierarchies of control

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,039
create some of those structures

197
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,919
so in hierarchies of competence you have

198
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,520
no

199
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:51,000
enforced structure in that manner

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,819
um a good example might be Netflix I

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,220
think holocracy they they they they use

202
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,919
some of those ideas where they have a

203
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,319
board which is kind of the enforced

204
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,840
hierarchy part they have a board who

205
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,440
sets strategic Direction but everybody

206
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,259
in the company's job is it everybody in

207
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,599
the company's job is to figure out what

208
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:17,039
can they do

209
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:20,220
to best fulfill that overall strategy

210
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,780
right so that could be I'm gonna go join

211
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,000
this team over here because I like what

212
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,979
they're doing or I've got a cool idea so

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm going to what's it called when you

214
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,000
attract people to your position

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
um you know you're going to be the

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,180
leader and attract follow attract

217
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,979
followers that's the one I tried

218
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,419
followers and move in a certain

219
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,899
direction

220
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,940
um and that's all ad hoc and dynamic in

221
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,380
that world so you can almost go well

222
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,880
that's that's all the way over here and

223
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,680
maybe your company's not ready for that

224
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,220
we're all the way over here in this

225
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,019
top-down terroristic waterfall model

226
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,600
you gotta figure out what's the first

227
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,700
thing we can do to help move a little

228
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,100
bit more in that direction to leverage

229
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,740
the people that we have and get closer

230
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,420
to the market and have a faster shorter

231
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,000
feedback loop faster turnaround time

232
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,440
between market triggers and actual

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,440
things happening in our organization
