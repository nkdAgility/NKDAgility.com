# What are hierarchies of competence vs control?

Have you ever had that feeling that you are being guided by a great coach, a master of their field? Someone who gets what you are trying to achieve, has the experience and skill to help you get there, but works with you to empower you to find the answer rather than dictating how things should be done?

Enter the micromanager.

Have you ever felt like you are simply being pushed into corners and stretched in ways that grate every nerve you've got? Treated like you are a worthless commodity that could be replaced at any moment with a drone or robot?

These are the major differences between hierarchies of competence and hierarchies of control. Martin Hinshelwood explains.
