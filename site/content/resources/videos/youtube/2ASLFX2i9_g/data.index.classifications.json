Specific practices like backlog grooming, realistic sprint goals, and feature audits are framed around delivering genuine value. Terms like 'value delivery,' 'aligned with users’ needs,' and 'leverage feedback' indicate clear conceptual alignment. However, direct, explicit discussion of feedback loops (customer telemetry, analytics) and comprehensive measurement of customer outcomes is present but not in-depth, slightly reducing depth. The audience is correctly targeted to agile practitioners, with content focused on process practices that serve customer value rather than internal metrics. No penalties apply as the information is current and positive.",
