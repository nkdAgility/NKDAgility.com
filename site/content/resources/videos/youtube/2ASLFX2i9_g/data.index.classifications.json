There are no references to SLE's probability-based cycle time forecasts, use of historical data, transparency around delivery timelines, or its role in continuous improvement. While some touchpoints bear indirect relation—such as maintaining realistic sprint goals and avoiding overcommitment—they do not discuss or analyze SLE as defined. The intended audience (Agile practitioners) does overlap modestly, but the main themes, depth, and explicit focus are unrelated to SLE.
