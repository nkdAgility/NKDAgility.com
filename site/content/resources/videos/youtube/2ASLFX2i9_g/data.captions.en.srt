1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,320
one of the seven uh deadly sins of agile

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:16,439
is gluttony and I see this a lot um in

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,720
teams where they're they're they're

4
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:23,560
backlogs and their products become

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,760
bloated um bloated and full of basically

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:30,439
just full of crap that needs to go right

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:34,520
so one one uh common um entry is is is

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,960
the product backlog if you if you go

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,040
into a team you're working with a team

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,520
and you go to look at their product

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,239
backlog and there's let's say there's

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,879
six or seven people working on this team

13
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,719
and they have 5,000 things in their

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,199
product backlog they're doing it wrong

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,600
right there that's that's greedy they'

16
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,800
they've eaten all those backlog items

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,640
they're sitting in their belly and they

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,920
can't walk around they can't move

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,440
they're not going to be nimble right

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,039
they're not going to be agile because

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,360
it's it's almost impossible to

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,840
understand like what is our value what

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,560
value is in our product backlog diving

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,799
into that thing is just just not a good

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,680
idea right you you've get too much stuff

26
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,400
in your product backlog another another

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,960
way gluttony manifests is during Sprint

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,720
planning right shoving more stuff into

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,400
the Sprint backlog uh than the team can

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,560
possibly deliver in a single Sprint and

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,799
that continually results in the team

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,840
having to vomit uh uh backlog items into

33
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,040
the next Sprint right if you think of it

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
that way perhaps teams will stop doing

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,920
it um taking on too much and then it

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,680
spews into the next Sprint and if it's

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,719
if it's one or two things that move into

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
the next Sprint and maybe not every

39
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,600
Sprint is probably okay right you're not

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,840
going to be successful in everything you

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,560
do but if you're constantly

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,119
got tons of things from a Sprint flowing

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
into the next Sprint flowing into the

44
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:10,039
next Sprint perhaps there's need to

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,360
consider um are we taking on too much

46
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,640
work um are we doing too much are we

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,080
taking on too much work um so that's

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,519
that's the second second form of of gney

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,959
uh that I see in teams and the third

50
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,400
form is uh leaving stuff that nobody

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,599
uses in your

52
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,519
product right uh this Standish group uh

53
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,080
in Boston used to create the chaos

54
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,239
report every year and they analyzed

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,879
about 70,000 projects worldwide and they

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:43,560
found that only only 35% of the features

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,840
uh that we build are used by our

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,560
customers 65% I think the phrase was use

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,480
little if ever 65% use little if ever so

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,239
so hopefully we can stop building them

61
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,640
in the first place right that would be

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,239
great let's stop building them in the

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,519
first place but if we we have built

64
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,280
them why are you keeping them in your

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,239
product why are you continuing to spend

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,200
maintenance hours support right how long

67
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,720
does your build take um how long would

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,480
your build take if you removed 65% of

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,239
the code that's in your product right

70
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
because you've got rid of those features

71
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,480
your build would be faster your teams

72
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,120
would be able to work faster there's a

73
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,000
less complicated uh body of content

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,640
you'll just get better and faster at

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,120
doing doing doing things

76
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,000
so the way to to to ah man loads of

77
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,760
teams just need a gastric bypass for

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,879
that right um how how do you how do you

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,439
restrict the the the amount of um stuff

80
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,480
that's in a in a product that's really

81
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,200
hard because it's it's that's that's

82
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,480
much harder than backlog or Sprint

83
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,120
backlog right um is to figure out what

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,879
percentage of the features of your

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,120
product are actually used and the the

86
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,840
worst is continuing to invest in

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,319
features that are of no use right

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,040
features that aren't used by your

89
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,040
customer because I guarantee you loads

90
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,680
of teams do that uh years years ago um I

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,560
worked with a A Bank in

92
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:22,400
Boston and um they were absolutely

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,440
adamant that this 65% was crap and that

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,199
they knew their customers way way better

95
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,759
than anybody else um and there's no way

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,120
they were they were wasting 65% it was a

97
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,560
lot less that's what they said so we we

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,240
we we said to them what's what's your

99
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,680
Flagship product that you build what's

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,680
the product that you think you know your

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,240
customers best and are building all the

102
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,360
awesome features like this one this

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:51,199
one's the best so we got in amongst the

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:54,759
code we added application insights app

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,840
insights is a an Azure uh uh feature

106
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,960
that can be plugged into any application

107
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,039
anywhere which basically collects data

108
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
so it's support course all the

109
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,840
programming languages all the setups and

110
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,240
you can out of the box it does a bunch

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,280
of stuff but then if you add this is a

112
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
feature right and you can say if some

113
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,320
how many times do users click that

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,840
button of our body of users how many of

115
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,080
them have clicked that button you can

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,560
get all of that data and we analyzed

117
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,240
their their their their product uh end

118
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,560
to end so we collected data for 3 months

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,319
um and then we went back to them and

120
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,080
said here's the 7 and a half% of

121
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:35,000
features that your customers use all the

122
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,960
rest was waste right um over 90% of the

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,560
money they invested in their product was

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
waste and what was really interesting

125
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,520
was that more than 80% of the items in

126
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,639
their backlog at the moment were going

127
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,280
towards additional capabilities for

128
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,199
features that weren't used by their

129
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:57,000
customers right so

130
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,880
no don't don't don't eat the whole thing

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,240
right you've got to figure out how do I

132
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,759
pick and choose what I'm going to eat

133
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,759
don't eat the whole feature at once

134
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,840
right you don't know if you like haggus

135
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,720
yet so don't order a whole plate full um

136
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,720
get like a like a starter that's got a

137
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,520
little bit of haggus and try that first

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,039
and then obviously when you realize you

139
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,560
do like it um and your customers like it

140
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,680
then you can make more right but don't

141
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,960
don't over uh uh OV eat um on your

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,520
product backlog don't e over eat in your

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,160
Sprint backlog and don't overeat in the

144
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,120
features in your product thanks for
