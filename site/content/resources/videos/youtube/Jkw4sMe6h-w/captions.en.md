That is an amazing, that's an amazing question. 

From my point of view, the main difference between traditional management and agile leadership is based on the context. Context is the king here, and it plays a crucial role. 

Traditional management was created for defined problems. The problems that maybe they are not easy in the sense we are producing some sophisticated stuff, but they are simple or obvious from a complexity point of view. So those are things that are relatively easy to follow. You need instructions, you need monitoring, you need someone with knowledge and expertise how to control the whole process. 

So if you face very little or no ambiguities, you have very little risks, very little unknowns. Well, you can completely forget about unknown unknowns. You might be lucky to take benefits from traditional management. Such managers are very important for this kind of problems and challenges. 

In my view, however, why we are talking about agile leadership and the importance of that? Well, my view is that we, as humankind, we've learned a lot how to improve things. 

Well, I mean automation, using sophisticated machines, algorithms, AI is helping us to translate problems that have some unknowns into something that can be handled by the machine. 

What does it mean for us, for humans? Well, more and more problems to come are moving towards complex domain. The domain that is very interesting, the domain that needs creativity. And this is the domain where traditional management might not be the best tool. 

So imagine the situation that you are coming to the restaurant, the waiter is serving a very hot soup, and now you have a sharp knife. Enjoy your meal! Most likely, you may cut yourself, right? So this is the metaphor that I personally love in that context. When you face complex problems with a lot of unknowns, traditional management might be seen as this sharp knife served next to the bowl with a very, very hot soup. 

So agile leadership changes its approach. It emerges as a response to our world with a lot of problems, a lot of ambiguities, a lot of unknown things. This is the leadership that is focused on taking the best out of us humans, taking the best out of creativity, creating teams, self-managing teams, teams that are making more and more decisions. 

And the role of the leader, because of that, is changing. It is changing towards creating the right environment, fostering, creating the right culture, and helping others in that process instead of controlling and monitoring.
