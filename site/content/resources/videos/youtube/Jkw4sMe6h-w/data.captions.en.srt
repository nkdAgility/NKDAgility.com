1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,780
that is an amazing that's an amazing

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,120
question so

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,400
from my point of view the main

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,779
difference between traditional

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,840
management and agile leadership is based

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:26,039
on the context context is the king here

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,920
and it plays a crucial crucial role so

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,360
traditional management

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:36,840
was created for defined problems so the

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,880
problems that maybe they are not easy in

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,719
the sense we are producing some

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,620
sophisticated stuff but they are simple

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,620
or obvious from a complexity point of

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,460
view so those are things that are

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,280
relatively easy to follow you need

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,440
instructions you need monitoring you

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,020
need someone with knowledge and

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,760
expertise how to control the whole

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,400
process

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,340
so if you face very little or no no

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,700
ambiguities you have very little risks

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,360
very little unknowns well you can

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,720
completely forget about unknown unknowns

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,600
you might be lucky to to take benefits

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,740
from traditional management such

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,960
managers are very important for this

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,520
kind of problems challenges in my view

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,920
however

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,100
why we are talking about agile

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,900
leadership and importance of that well

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,140
my my view is that we as humankind we've

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,320
learned a lot how to improve things

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,820
well I mean automation using

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,820
sophisticated machines algorithm AI is

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,460
helping us to translate problems that

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,619
have some unknowns into something that

37
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,920
can be handled by the machine

38
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,879
what does it mean for us for humans well

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,020
more and more problems to come are

40
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:20,060
moving towards complex domain the domain

41
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,520
that is very interesting the domain that

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,700
needs creativity and this is the domain

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,940
where traditional management might not

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,560
be the best tool so imagine the

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,099
situation that you are coming to the

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,680
rest around the waiter is serving a very

47
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,440
hot soup and now you have a sharp knife

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,500
enjoy your meal most likely you may cut

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,440
yourself right so this is this is the

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,200
metaphor that I personally love uh in

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,280
that context when You Face complex

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,860
problem with a lot of unknowns uh

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,640
traditional management might be seen as

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,519
this sharp knife served next to the bowl

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:07,319
with a very very hot soup

56
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:11,360
so adult leadership changes its approach

57
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,879
it emerges as a response to our

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,140
world with a lot of problems a lot of

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,200
ambiguities a lot of unknown things this

60
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,879
is the leadership that is focused on

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,580
taking the best out of us humans taking

62
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,720
the best out of creativity creating

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,900
teams self-managing teams teams that are

64
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,440
making more and more decisions and the

65
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,500
role of the leader because of that is

66
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,440
changing is changing towards creating

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,080
right environment

68
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,739
fostering creating right culture and

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:57,620
helping others in that process instead

70
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,620
of controlling and and monitoring
