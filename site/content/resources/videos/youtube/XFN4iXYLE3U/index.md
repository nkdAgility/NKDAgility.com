When it comes to Kanban, many teams get excited about visualizing their work. But there's a crucial element often overlooked: **limiting work in progress (WIP)**. Without this, you're not truly practicing Kanban. Limiting WIP is fundamental to controlling your workflow, understanding the system's bottlenecks, and delivering high-quality products at a sustainable pace.

In this post, I‚Äôll delve into why limiting WIP is essential in Kanban, how it helps teams stay focused, and share personal insights on its impact on real-world projects.

## **What is Work in Progress (WIP)? üßê**

Before we dive into the importance of limiting WIP, let‚Äôs clarify what we mean by ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù In simple terms, WIP refers to the tasks or projects that are currently being worked on but are not yet completed. It could be:

- Features being developed

- Bugs being fixed

- Stories in progress

The key takeaway here is that these items are in progress, but they are not yet **done**.

## **The Hidden Dangers of Too Much WIP** **‚ö†Ô∏è**

When teams take on too much work at once, the flow of work slows down. Why? Because multitasking and spreading focus thin across too many tasks lead to delays, confusion, and missed deadlines. Here‚Äôs what happens when WIP is not limited:

- **Task switching**: Moving between tasks reduces efficiency and increases the time it takes to complete each one.

- **Bottlenecks**: Without limits, bottlenecks in your workflow become invisible, causing delays that impact the entire system.

- **Quality suffers**: The more tasks a team juggles, the more likely quality issues will arise, as attention is divided across too many tasks.

### **Personal Experience: The Time My Team Took on Too Much WIP** **üõë**

I remember working with a team that had no limit on their work in progress. We were constantly starting new features, fixing bugs, and dealing with customer requests. However, the lack of focus meant that everything was moving slowly. The team felt overwhelmed, and customer satisfaction was declining.

By introducing WIP limits, we quickly saw improvements. Tasks started moving through the system faster, quality improved, and we could actually **see** where the bottlenecks were. Limiting WIP was a game-changer for us.

## **Why Limiting Work in Progress is Crucial for Kanban Success** **üéØ**

If you're not limiting your work in progress, guess what? You're not doing Kanban.

### **Focus on Value Delivery** **üöÄ**

Limiting WIP allows teams to focus on what truly matters: **delivering value**. By narrowing down the number of tasks in progress, team members can concentrate on completing the highest priority items, leading to faster delivery of usable products.

- Teams can focus on fewer tasks, which increases concentration.

- You can spot and fix bottlenecks faster.

- Higher priority items get the attention they deserve.

### **Visibility of Bottlenecks** **üëÄ**

When too much work is in progress, bottlenecks are harder to spot. WIP limits help reveal constraints in the system. For example, if tasks keep piling up in the ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù column without moving forward, that signals a bottleneck. By setting WIP limits, it becomes easier to identify and address these issues before they snowball.

- WIP limits help visualize where work is getting stuck.

- Teams can proactively address bottlenecks to maintain a smooth workflow.

- Reduced stress as work flows more predictably.

### **Sustainable Pace for the Team** **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

Overloading your team with tasks isn't just inefficient; it‚Äôs also unsustainable. A team that constantly juggles too many tasks will quickly burn out. Limiting WIP encourages a sustainable work pace, ensuring the team stays productive and motivated over the long haul.

"The secret to a high-performing team is balancing the workload so that they can work at a sustainable pace."

This approach doesn't just help with short-term productivity; it keeps the team healthy and engaged over time.

### **The Kanban Flow: Keeping the Pipeline Moving ‚è≥**

The goal of Kanban is to maintain a steady flow of work, moving items from start to finish as efficiently as possible. Limiting WIP ensures that the work flowing through the system moves at a sustainable, manageable pace. This, in turn, ensures the timely delivery of high-quality, usable products.

- Smooth flow of work from one stage to the next.

- Faster identification and resolution of roadblocks.

- Higher predictability and less chaos in the process.

## **How to Set WIP Limits That Work for Your Team** **üõ†Ô∏è**

Now that we‚Äôve established why limiting WIP is essential, let‚Äôs discuss how to do it.

### **Step 1: Assess Your Team's Capacity** **üèóÔ∏è**

Every team has a different capacity, so start by evaluating how much work your team can handle at any given time. For example:

- How many people are on the team?

- How complex are the tasks?

- What are the team's current responsibilities?

### **Step 2: Set Initial WIP Limits** **üìä**

Set a WIP limit for each stage of the workflow. This might be:

- 3 tasks in the "To Do" column

- 2 tasks in the "In Progress" column

- 1 task in the "Testing" column

The key here is to start with a manageable number and adjust as you go.

### **Step 3: Monitor and Adjust** **‚öôÔ∏è**

Kanban is all about continuous improvement, so don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak your WIP limits as the team evolves. If you notice work is getting stuck, try lowering the limit. If things are moving too quickly, you might be able to increase it slightly.

## **Pro Tip: Keep the Team Engaged** **üí°**

Limiting WIP can feel restrictive at first, but it‚Äôs important to get the whole team on board. Communicate the benefits of limiting WIP clearly, and involve them in setting the limits. This increases buy-in and makes the transition smoother.

### **Personal Advice: Involve the Team in Setting WIP Limits** **üó£Ô∏è**

In one of my Scrum teams, we initially faced resistance to setting WIP limits. Team members felt it would slow them down. However, after a few sprints of experimentation and involving them in the process, they started to see the value. Productivity went up, and frustration went down.

## **Conclusion: Limit Your WIP, Boost Your Productivity** **üí™**

In Kanban, **limiting work in progress** isn‚Äôt optional‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. It enables teams to:

- Deliver value consistently

- Identify and resolve bottlenecks

- Maintain a sustainable work pace

- Improve the overall quality of their work

By setting appropriate WIP limits, you ensure that your team stays focused, productive, and capable of delivering high-quality products to your customers. So, if you‚Äôre practicing Kanban, remember this golden rule: **Limit your WIP and watch your workflow transform.** üòä
