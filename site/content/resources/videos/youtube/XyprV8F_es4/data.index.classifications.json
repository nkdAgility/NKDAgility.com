    "reasoning": "The content focuses on leadership's role in enabling agile and cultural transformation, with indirect reference to automation, tooling, and continuous delivery. However, there are no explicit mentions or substantive discussions of agentic software delivery, autonomous AI agents, context-aware intelligence, or agency in software delivery. While modern engineering practices are generally referenced (e.g. automation, architecture), these are not situated in an agentic or AI-grounded context, but rather as supporting agile practices. The primary audience (leaders, agile practitioners) partially overlaps with those interested in agentic paradigms, but the thematic focus remains on organisational and cultural change, not on autonomous agents or their integration. Signal is moderately relevant, with little off-topic material, but fails to address the category core even implicitly.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content discusses agile leadership, automation, and delivery practices but lacks agentic software delivery concepts—no AI agent integration, contextual intelligence, or autonomy themes. Fit is minimal; only tangentially related through tooling and culture.",
