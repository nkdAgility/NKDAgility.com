1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,640
in

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:10,840
organizations leadership plays a pivotal

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,920
role in uh driving cultural and

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,720
organizational change um that enables

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,039
you to support the frequent and reliable

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,279
deployments across multiple teams and

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,880
there are a number of key things that

8
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:30,840
leadership probably wants to focus on or

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,040
at least try to see if it can have an

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,320
impact on these things one is setting

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,640
Clear Vision and goals um if you look at

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,840
Dan Pink's book drive around autonomy

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,239
Mastery and purpose purpose is a huge

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,520
part of that and setting Clear Vision

15
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:51,360
and

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,960
goals enables people to have purpose

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,840
they can see how the work that they're

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,840
doing every day um benefits the overall

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,719
organization worked to achieve those

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,119
goals so making making those connections

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,360
leaders can also invest in Automation

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
and

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,799
tooling if you want to do continuous

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,640
delivery to production it's going to

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,600
require a a number of things to happen

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,759
within your organization one of those

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,759
things is that you need to support that

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,759
ability to deliver faster right so if

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,119
you've got on Prem servers where on Prem

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,520
environments where if the developers ask

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,600
for a new environment it takes six weeks

32
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,840
for the operations team to to go buy the

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,000
hardware build that out deliver that

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
deliver that in some way then you're not

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,320
going to be able to move to continuous

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,520
delivery it's not possible right that's

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,520
a six week Blocker in the middle of that

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,479
six weeks constraint so um investing in

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
learning around these Technologies

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
Automation and tooling to be able to

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,039
support that to be able to sport teams

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,479
moving more quickly um automated

43
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,959
deployments automated building out of

44
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:11,599
environments automated everything right

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,879
then that that's one piece the other

46
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,319
piece is that the applications that you

47
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,120
currently have that you may have a

48
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,760
long-term strategy for right they're

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,040
going to be around for a long time may

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,640
not be architected in a way because

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,560
maybe they've been around for a long

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,239
time already may not be arch architected

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,720
in a way that's suitable for for

54
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,360
continuous Sol to to production that's

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,879
just reality right as you change the

56
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,920
demands you're putting on the product

57
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,480
you're going to have to change the

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,000
architecture of the product in order to

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,480
support the new demands that you're

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,720
putting on it so investing in the the

61
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,000
the time and effort for the teams to be

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,360
able to work towards those outcomes and

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
we're not talking about we're not going

64
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,920
to deliver any new features because

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,760
we're trying to do this we're talking

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,159
about enabling them to do a little piece

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,720
at a time um the the the the azured

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,560
devops team had uh some architectural

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,080
changes they needed to make in their

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,239
test infrastructure in order to reduce

71
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,959
their time to Market and to completely

72
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,680
clear off the old test infrastructure

73
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,360
took four years right we're not talking

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,239
about shorter time frame we're talking

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,159
about long-term products that exist in

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,280
the market as your devops the the

77
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,680
product that is as your devops was

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,439
originally released in the market in

79
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,480
2006 uh we're now in 202 five so it's 19

80
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,400
years that product has been in the

81
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,120
market been making them money been a

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,120
flagship product within that context and

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,720
visual studio has been a product for for

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,280
for for longer right these are long-term

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,720
products and they need long-term

86
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,280
thinking about investment in

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,400
architecture investment in refactoring

88
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,480
investment in Automation and in change

89
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,239
right because your needs your demands as

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,599
the business on engineering

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,200
the demands of the customer on

92
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,159
engineering are going to change over

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
time and you need to change your product

94
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,959
and invest in changing your product to

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,920
support that so that really comes back

96
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,880
to to this idea of continuous learning

97
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,199
and Improvement not just on in on your

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,280
plate as Leaders but also on the

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,240
engineering team's plate are are you

100
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,080
putting your engineers under so much

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,560
time pressure that their biggest problem

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,600
is getting stuff out the door or

103
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,320
do they have time to to talk about and

104
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,759
discuss how what they need to learn how

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,320
they need to change the product um the

106
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,199
refactors that they have to do or when

107
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,759
they start talking about those things is

108
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,000
the immediate answer no we don't have

109
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,160
time to do that because we've got to Shi

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,080
some features that's a losing

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,120
proposition absolutely a losing

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,880
proposition it's not a short-term losing

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,440
proposition but it's a long-term losing

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,720
proposition there there is no way to win

115
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,199
uh

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,120
cutting short-term

117
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,080
quality cutting quality for short-term

118
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:16,160
wins rather than long-term wins

119
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,600
so those things together as Leaders

120
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,120
along with I there's loads of things you

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,720
could do you you could you could you

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,960
could break down silos in the

123
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,360
organization so if you have coding uh

124
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,560
hierarchy and test

125
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,919
hierarchy anytime you've got a a a test

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
manager and a Dev manager and then you

127
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,479
get team members that are reporting to

128
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
multiple people because they've got the

129
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,440
team that they're on and perhaps a

130
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,600
product manager that they're dealing

131
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,199
with and then they've got their Dev

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
manager as a line manager and other

133
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,440
people in the team have their test

134
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,120
manager as a line manager that's a mess

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
right that that's that's complicated

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,840
that's people being pulled in different

137
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,600
directions that's teams having more

138
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,720
difficulty more friction in working

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
together towards a common goal than in

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,479
not working together towards a common

141
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,520
goal right because there's more uh

142
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,960
things pulling them in different

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,199
directions so breaking down silos um and

144
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,360
ultimately leading by example people are

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,560
going to look to their leaders to see

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,360
how are we expected to behave within the

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,639
context of this organization and our

148
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:30,840
leaders need to present that example

149
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:35,199
that we can use to to to

150
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:39,039
to build that culture of collaboration

151
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,039
and Trust within our organization
