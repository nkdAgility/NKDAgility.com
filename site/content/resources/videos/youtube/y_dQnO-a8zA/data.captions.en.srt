1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,160
change your culture should evolve with

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,760
them because let's face it new tech is a

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,320
constraint frameworks will come and go

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,040
platforms rise peak and fade but if

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,320
you're engineering culture can't adapt

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
every shift feels like a fire drill

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,439
that's the difference between reacting

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,560
and responding the strongest teams don't

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,679
chase every trend they learn fast adapt

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,719
thoughtfully and evolve how they work

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,920
without losing momentum that does not

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,800
happen by accident at Nicode Agility we

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,160
help engineering leads build a culture

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,800
that absorbs change not get knocked over

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,239
by it we train teams to become learning

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,039
organizations not just groups of people

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,360
that write code but teams that reflect

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,320
improve and align their practices with

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,480
business goals it's not about being

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
agile in name it's about creating a

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,239
system where adaption is expected

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,520
supported and measured that's how you

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,479
stay relevant not by betting on every

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,119
new tool but by investing in a culture

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,119
that handles whatever comes next
