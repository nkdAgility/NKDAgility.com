1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,179
foreign

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,519
is how do you select the most valuable

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,040
items for the Sprint backlog if you take

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,560
a look at this the scrum guide it will

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,420
it will just say you magically select

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,460
the ones you need right you you kind of

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,119
craft craft

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,160
uh uh uh a Sprint goal and then magic

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,619
fairy dust is sprinkled on it and and

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
you get a list of things but the reality

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,640
is a lot more complicated than that the

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,780
reality is that

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,640
um you have to take information from

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,219
information from the business the

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
business context the product owner's

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,140
context and their understanding of of

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,719
the market and the business context the

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,460
engineering context what's happening in

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,820
the product what what's what's going on

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,300
there and you bring all of that together

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,260
and then you figure out what your Sprint

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,140
goal is going to be and that Sprint goal

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,580
then at least shapes the initial set of

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,799
work you're going to bring into the

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,180
bring into that that Sprint

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,380
so

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,700
um

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,720
the most important things could be the

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,040
things at the top of your product

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,020
backlog

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
could be

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,640
um but I would say that the order of the

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,020
product backlog informs but does not

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,380
control the work that the Developers

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,240
accept pool into the Sprint because

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,460
there might be other considerations that

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,560
take priority right this is the most

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,119
important thing we need to work on yeah

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,040
but in order to do that we've got this

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,380
big chunk of architectural stuff we have

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,540
to do first therefore we're going to

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,360
focus on the next most important piece

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,280
of value and this architectural stuff so

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,680
that next Sprint we can hopefully take

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,659
on this most important thing right that

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,540
might be more considerations for that so

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,360
it has to be carefully thought out and

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,159
buy the whole scrum team so the product

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,720
owner needs to work closely with the

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,759
developers the developers work closely

51
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,280
with the product owner to figure out

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,459
what are we going to take into the front

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,580
the Sprint and it's not always the most

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,560
important thing in the product backlog

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,420
