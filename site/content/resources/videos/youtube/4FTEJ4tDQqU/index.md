When I reflect on my journey from a developer to an advocate for Agile practices, I often find myself pondering the question: why did I embrace Agile over traditional project management? The truth is, during my time as a developer, I didn’t consciously choose Agile; rather, it was a reaction to the limitations I experienced with conventional project management methods.

### My Early Experiences

Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to work at various organisations, including Merrill Lynch, several design agencies, and a generator manufacturer. Each of these environments approached projects in a similar, traditional manner. Interestingly, the most progressive of these was the generator company, which might seem odd at first glance. However, the reason for this was simple: the leadership was exceptional. 

In contrast, my experiences often left me feeling disillusioned. I encountered project managers who seemed disconnected from the realities of our work. It was as if they didn’t grasp the complexities of what we were doing, nor did they seem to care. This disconnect was frustrating and, I believe, it significantly shaped my perspective on project management.

### Transitioning to DevOps

As I transitioned from development into the DevOps space, I began to see the value of Agile principles more clearly. Initially, I thought of DevOps primarily in terms of tools. Many people might argue against this, but in my experience, the reality is that tools play a significant role in DevOps. However, I soon realised that the tools themselves were not the solution to our problems; it was the people using them who truly mattered.

I frequently assisted clients in migrating to Azure DevOps, and time and again, I encountered the same issue: they wanted to replicate their old, ineffective processes in a new tool. I found myself in the position of having to explain that the problem wasn’t the tool; it was the way they were using it. 

### The Baggage We Carry

Many clients would acknowledge their past mistakes and express a desire for a fresh start. Yet, despite their intentions, they often brought along the same old baggage—inefficient processes, unnecessary custom fields, and convoluted rules. This is where the real work began: engaging with people to rethink their workflows, simplify processes, and reduce bureaucracy.

For anyone who has used Jira, you’ll know that custom fields and rules can be a nightmare. The challenge lies in stripping back to the essentials: do you really need that field? Does it add value? Does it bring you joy? The goal should be to retain only what is absolutely necessary for your business.

### Discovering Scrum

My journey took a pivotal turn when I travelled to Australia to participate in the beta for the Professional Scrum Developer (PSD) class. It was there that I was introduced to Scrum. To become a PSD trainer, I had to take a Scrum class, and it was a revelation. The principles of Scrum resonated deeply with me; they aligned perfectly with the challenges I had faced throughout my software engineering career.

I realised that Scrum could help others navigate the same obstacles I had encountered. For the next five years, I maintained a focus on DevOps, but I quickly learned that when clients sought DevOps assistance, they often needed help with deeper organisational issues—issues related to people, bureaucracy, and how to structure their businesses to maximise value.

### The Freedom of Agility

What ultimately drew me to Agile was its liberating nature. It empowers teams to break free from constraints and fosters an environment where they can thrive. I believe that when engineers are given the freedom to innovate and solve problems, they can achieve remarkable results.

In conclusion, my journey from developer to Agile advocate was not a straightforward path. It was shaped by my experiences with traditional project management, my transition into DevOps, and my eventual discovery of Scrum. I encourage anyone grappling with similar challenges to consider the principles of Agile and how they can transform not just your processes, but your entire organisational culture.
