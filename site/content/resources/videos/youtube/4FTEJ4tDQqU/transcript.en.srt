1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,340
okay so the question is why why did I

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:17,160
Embrace agile over traditional project

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,580
management practices when I was a

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,580
developer

5
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,439
um

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,500
I don't think well I don't think I did

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,260
while I was a developer

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,980
I think the reason I picked

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,100
agile and agile practices was because as

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,719
a developer I was always subjected to

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
the traditional project management

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,399
practices

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,960
um I'd worked through that I worked at

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,360
Merrill Lynch

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,219
I worked for a number of design agencies

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,980
I worked for a generator uh

17
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:56,039
manufacturer and and rental company and

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,500
in all of those cases they approached

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,600
the projects in quite a similar fashion

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,160
probably the most Progressive was the

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,979
was the generator company which is weird

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,900
but it's because the boss was awesome

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,900
um and that

24
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,200
damaged me I think I I I definitely felt

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,340
like

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,500
these people didn't know what they were

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,380
talking about didn't understand what

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,979
we're actually doing it didn't feel like

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,340
they even gave a crap

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,740
um and then as I started to do more

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,960
devops so I started to migrate from

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,700
development into the devops space so not

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,299
even the agile space it's the other side

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,259
of uh agility from the technical side

35
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,320
um I started to get more engaged in the

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,079
idea that yeah devops is devops is great

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,700
but a lot of devops is about tools I

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,439
know people might dispute that but a lot

39
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,000
of devops is about tools and a lot of

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,619
devops in the world and they're in the

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,720
real world is about tools

42
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,399
and I started to realize more and more

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,720
that it's not the tools that solve the

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,479
problem it's the people that solve the

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,820
problem and it's not the tools that are

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,759
the problem it's often the people that

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,760
are the problem right because time and

48
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,819
time again I was using I did a lot of

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,200
migrations to Azure devops for customers

50
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,060
so moving them from whatever they were

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,680
doing before to Azure devops and they

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,360
wanted to do the same stupid stuff that

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,520
they did with their old tool with Azure

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,500
devops and I had to try and explain to

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,180
them that that so the reason this tool

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,379
is actually a problem is not because the

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,300
tool is a problem it's because of the

58
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,680
way you're using the tool and a lot of

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,300
them did it deliberately right they're

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,340
like yeah we've totally messed up this

61
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,379
tool and we really want a clean slate to

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,340
go into this new thing

63
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,319
um and then we don't have all the

64
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,000
baggage and I'm like yeah but you're

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,580
bringing this baggage in that baggage in

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,440
this other baggage and that's where you

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,420
start talking to people you start

68
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,160
convincing people to start thinking

69
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,959
about working in different ways to

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
simplifying their process to reducing

71
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,300
levels of Bureau

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,500
custom fields and rules oh my goodness

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,260
me

74
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,000
um if anybody's uh used jira as your

75
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,560
devops of old

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,879
um custom fields and rules of the bane

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
of your life

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,080
um and trying to go back back to

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,599
defaults right do you actually need that

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,959
thing does it actually add value does it

81
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:19,080
bring you Joy right the the the the you

82
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,900
know only have uh those those fields

83
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,400
those rules that you absolutely have to

84
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,659
have to do business and you don't really

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,340
want anything else

86
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,420
so

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,000
um my my move was through that technical

88
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,280
going into the high level Technical and

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,300
then kind of sideways into agility and

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
actually

91
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,620
um

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,560
um went to Australia to do the the the

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,560
um the PSD the beta for the old PSD

94
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,959
class from Richard Hunt housing

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,239
um and that that was where I got

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,040
introduced to scrum

97
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,739
um because in order to be a PSD trainer

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,099
I had to take a scrub class

99
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:03,000
um and I I just totally totally made

100
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:06,659
sense right it just made sense it it fit

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,819
the ideas solved the problems that I was

102
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,159
or enabled the problems to be solved

103
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,620
that I'd been looking at my entire

104
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,079
software engineering career and I wanted

105
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,000
to help other people do those things

106
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,380
better because I saw in all the

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,720
customers that I'd had that this would

108
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,460
start to solve their problems too

109
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,800
um but I still came in for the next

110
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,979
probably five years with a devops Focus

111
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,600
but as soon as you come in remember you

112
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,580
come in with one Focus because the

113
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,400
customer says we need some devops help

114
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,919
and then you like okay you say you need

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,080
some devops help but actually actually

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,639
you you need to fix this problem over

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
here which is about people in

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,620
organization and bureaucracy and how you

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,540
organize your business in order to

120
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,220
maximize the value they create and the

121
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,660
engineers can take care of this devopsy

122
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,880
stuff over here you get smart people

123
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,500
right they're just constrained and

124
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,100
aren't able to actually do things and I

125
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:03,560
think that freeing nature of of agility

126
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,560
is what what kind of Drew me to it

127
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,979
