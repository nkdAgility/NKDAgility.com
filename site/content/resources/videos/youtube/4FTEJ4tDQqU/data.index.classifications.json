    "reasoning": "The content is a personal narrative covering the author's shift from traditional project management to Agile, Scrum, and DevOps practices. There are no explicit references to agentic concepts, autonomous AI agents, human-AI collaboration, or proactive context-aware intelligence. The discussion focuses on process, human factors, and the evolution of culture but does not introduce or align with the principles, methods, or technology relevant to Agentic Software Delivery. The audience and purpose are broadly compatible with technical change, but little to no conceptual overlap exists. Overall, this is not a fit for the given category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "No explicit or conceptual coverage of Agentic Software Delivery topics or technology. Content is focused on Agile, Scrum, and DevOps from a human/process angle. Fit with the assigned category is very weak.",
