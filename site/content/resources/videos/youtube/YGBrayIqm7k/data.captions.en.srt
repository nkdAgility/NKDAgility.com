1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,440
when we're building products um there

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,320
are are

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,160
are really two main parts of of the

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,759
consideration that we have we need to

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,039
think about product management and we

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,640
need to think about product development

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:24,240
so product management is deciding what

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,720
we're going to go build right um product

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,439
development is figuring out how we're

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,440
going to go do that and they need to be

11
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,280
able to complement each other in a way

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,399
that we're working together

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:44,120
towards a successful working product but

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,840
product management leads the product

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,640
development the product management sets

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,079
the direction the strategy the the goals

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,039
that we're trying to

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,280
achieve um the high level goals

19
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,320
strategic goals and product development

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,120
focuses on the actual delivery of those

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,719
goals and delivery of those outcomes now

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,080
that doesn't mean that there's no

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,479
product management in product

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,759
development or there's no product

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,119
development in product management

26
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,159
there's there's definitely a a bleed

27
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:15,520
over between those two um two topics

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,320
they're not they're not a distinct thing

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,479
that somebody hands over from here to

30
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,200
here right um they're they're an

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,920
integrated story and I think a good

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,240
analogy for that is the evidence-based

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,720
management story that helps at least it

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,280
helps me

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,399
think about not only how they interact

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,240
with each other um but how they

37
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,280
complement each other and how they need

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,479
each other right product management and

39
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,560
product development in order to to be

40
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,799
successful and working together to be

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,280
successful so the way evidence-based

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,479
management breaks this down is is um

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,960
you've

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,320
got two sets of metrics at the at the

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,439
top of the diagram which is Market

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,600
talking about market value so in the

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,840
context of market value that's where

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,159
we're talking about product management

49
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,879
we're focusing on two things we've got

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,400
our current value in our product um the

51
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,760
stuff that's there that um maybe we need

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,319
to maintain maybe we need to remove

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
maybe we need to augment in some way

54
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,319
right that's the the features and

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
capability that we have in our product

56
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,080
right now and all of those features and

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
capability in our product night right

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,400
now should all work right that working

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,480
usable product we have increments that

60
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,640
work and our current increment our

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,239
current product is our current value

62
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,599
right that's what we've currently got

63
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,519
that's part of our market value um if

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,280
you're if you're not in a consumer

65
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:46,280
facing world then um think about your

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,720
your the market that you deliver to is

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,239
inside of your business it's not

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,360
necessarily doesn't have to be outside

69
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,599
of your business doesn't have to be a

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,560
commercial Market it could be an

71
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,519
internal Market inside your business

72
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,200
right um and then the other side of that

73
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,400
is the unrealized value and that's where

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,159
I think

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,599
a lot of product management maybe

76
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:10,200
doesn't Focus but should focus is in

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,440
this unrealized value area which is the

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,599
stuff that our product could do that it

79
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,799
doesn't do yet right the net new

80
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,120
functionality that we want to bring in

81
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,560
um the net new functionality that we

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:29,400
want to bring into the story so that um

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,319
is going after new markets new users um

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,280
new

85
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,120
we want more people to be using our

86
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,319
product than we're using it before

87
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,760
because you're always going to have a a

88
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,040
decline in the people that use your

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,360
product um if the features remain

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,879
stagnant right even if you add uh new

91
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,400
capabilities to an existing feature

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,040
there's there's still that uh um tail

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,680
off that we're keeping our existing user

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,959
base happy and our existing user base um

95
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,000
is always going to juice over time if we

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,760
don't do anything right we might still

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,200
be bringing in new customers but the

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,560
existing people are going to going to

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,799
going to tail off that's how I I I think

100
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,079
about it I think about it a lot like um

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:23,199
Netflix uh creating new content right if

102
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,280
you if you have a an existing show um

103
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,400
the viewership for that show is going to

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,840
decline over time right it's not new

105
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,520
anymore people that have watched it are

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,720
not necessarily going to watch it again

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
although some people do and it's going

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,520
to decline over time that's a little bit

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,600
more drastic than a than a product that

110
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,240
people use in a business right but the

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,759
idea is that you're not you're not

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,680
gaining a lot of new customers and when

113
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,000
you to do when you do a second season of

114
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,680
an existing season you know the

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
viewership is going to be less in the

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,759
second season it's always less but does

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,520
it maintain high enough for you to

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,160
justify the investment right what we

119
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,160
really want to be doing is focusing as

120
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,039
much as we can while supporting and

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
maintaining our existing investment in

122
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,479
our in our product in our story in our

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,039
existing customers we also want to be

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,520
aggressively going after new markets and

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,520
new customers that's that's product

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
management leading right where are we

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,319
going what are we trying to achieve

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,919
what's our Direction what's our strategy

129
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,880
for for building a a more valuable

130
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,360
product right value creation we're

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,319
creating more value that's that

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,520
unrealized value and those two together

133
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:34,479
um unrealized value and current value is

134
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,280
that agile product management um story

135
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,000
that leads to market value right that's

136
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:43,360
what we're measuring market value

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,800
and the the activity is product

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,199
management but then we've got the the

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,199
the product development which is

140
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:55,360
supporting that story um and product

141
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,120
development is our organization's

142
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,199
capability right that's our ability to

143
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,440
deliver the things that we identify that

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,240
need to be delivered and perhaps input

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,759
to those things as well right provide

146
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,000
part part of the feedback cycle that's

147
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,280
what I mean by the bleed over right uh

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,440
product development is going to have

149
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,560
good ideas too that we might want to

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:19,800
implement um but that's broken into two

151
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,360
sets of sets of metrics in in in product

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,599
development one is uh ability to

153
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,000
innovate right that's our how much time

154
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,319
can we spend on net new versus

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,440
maintaining and supporting existence

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,000
right so that's how we're measuring that

157
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,680
amount of time that we spend on net new

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,560
and then the other side of that um to to

159
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,400
balance it off is time to Market how um

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,360
quickly can we go from an idea to

161
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,960
getting in into production so ability to

162
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
innovate and time to Market both talk

163
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,759
about product quality talk about

164
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,560
engineering Excellence um talk about

165
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
those stories that's our our agile

166
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,000
product development product development

167
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,080
is about building high quality usable

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,440
working products that are of value to

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,720
somebody right that's product that's

170
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,520
just product development agile product

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,520
development um is just the newer

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,400
practices in that in that story um so

173
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,240
we've got this uh product management

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,800
leading looking at the market looking at

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,800
the Futures looking at it um what

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,280
customers are going to need in the

177
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,680
future what our stakeholders are going

178
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,680
to need in the future and trying to

179
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
anticipate those needs by running lots

180
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,319
of little experiments some of those

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,879
experiments will be implemented uh by

182
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
product development right so we can then

183
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,520
get the results uh but

184
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,159
ultimately delivering usable working

185
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,280
product enables us to to to maximize

186
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:56,479
that value return because we're closing

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,879
those feedback looks so we've got

188
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,919
product management leading with Str stry

189
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,639
and Direction and vision right Vision uh

190
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,319
value and validation is is is product

191
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,440
Management's focus and then in

192
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,919
order to get that value and validation

193
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,960
we need to actually build something we

194
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,199
need to actually create something that

195
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,960
we can then put in front of our our our

196
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,680
our our users our stakeholders to then

197
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,520
gather feedback and actually uh see

198
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,240
whether is it actually valuable are they

199
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,159
actually using it the way we expect is

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,800
it actually changing the number the way

201
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,680
we would like and that's how agile

202
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,080
product management leads but is

203
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,800
supported by product development and

204
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,080
product development supports that story

205
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,560
of uh uh collecting that data that

206
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,560
Telemetry that um additional information

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
that product management can use to

208
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,000
figure out whether are we actually going

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,800
in the right direction do we need to

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,279
stay the course do we need to Pivot or

211
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,279
do we need to stop
