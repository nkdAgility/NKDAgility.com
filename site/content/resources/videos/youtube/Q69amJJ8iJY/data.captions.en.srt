1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,759
huge mistake that organizations make

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,240
when they're trying to move towards

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:15,679
having a DevOps strategy, having

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,000
engineering excellence, having that that

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,840
better suite of modern engineering

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
practices within their organization is

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,519
they outsource it to a vendor.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,800
That is that is probably the least

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,519
likely way to result in a positive

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,559
outcome for your business because you're

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,600
you're giving the engineers in your

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,800
business a bunch of new stuff that they

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
don't understand very well that they

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,680
perhaps don't understand at all. Black

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,520
boxes that this vendor's created and

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,200
you're probably going to end up with a

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
lot of vendor lock in. and you're going

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,079
to need that vendor to come back and

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,680
redo things on a regular cadence and

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,680
it's going to be very expensive and

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,440
you're probably going to find that

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,600
there's going to be a long time between

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,199
those things, right? It's why you end up

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
on old versions of your product in the

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:11,680
first place. So instead of a vendor,

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,880
you need somebody somebody's

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,960
who are going to come in and help you

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
change that mindset within your

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,080
organization of of start moving people

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,159
towards engineering excellence. Helping

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,439
your people rebuild their workflows in a

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,799
way that makes sense in a modern

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,680
engineering context. Have them help your

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,799
people fix their problems. Um, and

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,200
that's something that I do with most

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,600
organizations that I work with is I'm

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
coming in and I'm helping their people

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,520
do it. I often don't even have

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,119
credentials in their system, right? I I

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm not making changes for them. I'm

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
helping them make changes. I'm

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
encouraging them to refactor the things

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,439
that they're working on. I'm encouraging

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,960
them to break it down. we're talking

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,600
about the theory and uh uh philosophies

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,560
on like why would you want to move in

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,599
this direction and then I'm helping them

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
implement those things um as they start

49
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,879
hitting problems in the actual

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,319
technology right um just working with a

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,280
customer at the moment that's on TFVC

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,680
and we need to move them to git they

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
have SDN and TFVC and they need to go to

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
a modern source control system a

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,239
distributed source control

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,599
Um they're they're on they have stuff on

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:41,280
.NET 3 um yeah .NET 35. Um they have

58
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,760
stuff on old versions of of of

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,720
everything. And h how how do you tackle

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,280
that upgrade? How do you even get

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,360
started? How do you make that

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,200
progression towards the smallest piece

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
you can bite off and figure out how to

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,239
do that first? What are the implications

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,280
of making certain changes? Right.

66
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,080
There's a massive implication of moving

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,959
from a a serverbased source control

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,200
system like TFVC or subversion and then

69
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,239
adapting over to a distributed source

70
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,480
control system like uh like like git

71
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,239
which has a lot of implications of

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,920
branching strategy. It has implications

73
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
of what you put in your source code. It

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,200
has implications of how do you manage

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
your product towards production. It has

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
loads of implications down the line that

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
are part of modernizing your engineering

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,799
practices. And that requires

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,360
partnership, not a vendor. A vendor is

80
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,799
going to do the stuff for you. And your

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,480
people aren't going to learn anything.

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,239
You need a partner who can teach,

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,720
mentor, coach, and engineering

84
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,120
transformational experience within your

85
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,560
organization. That's something that we

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,840
can help you with. My background is

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
software engineering, not coaching and

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,599
training, software engineering. I'm a

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,920
Microsoft MVP in DevOps and GitHub.

90
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,159
I have uh engineering experience in

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,000
building out DevOps pipelines. I was a

92
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:18,959
DevOps consultant uh for many years and

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,280
helping teams get better at building out

94
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,600
um these modern engineering practices

95
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,680
and the implications of these modern

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
engineering practices for their existing

97
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,080
pract practices and building a strategy

98
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:37,199
to get between them is where I bring my

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:40,720
expertise and let's get you to

100
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:45,639
engineering excellence on Your terms at

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,639
your pace with expert guidance.
