🤝 You Don’t Need a Vendor. You Need a DevOps Partner.
🎥 Episode 10 of 10 — From Legacy to Engineering Excellence with Azure DevOps

📉 Too many organizations try to “buy” their way to DevOps by outsourcing everything to a vendor.
Here’s why that fails:
🔒 Black-box systems your engineers don’t understand
🔁 Ongoing vendor dependency
💸 Expensive upgrades and lock-in
📆 And delays that leave you stuck on outdated tech

Real transformation doesn’t come from the outside in.
It comes from the inside out.

At NKD Agility, we don’t “do DevOps” to you.
We work with your people—side-by-side—to help them:
✅ Rebuild their workflows
✅ Modernize incrementally
✅ Learn the why behind the tools
✅ Solve real problems in real time

We don’t just coach. We’ve engineered this journey.
🧠 Microsoft MVP in DevOps & GitHub
🔧 Decades of real-world engineering experience
📈 Proven migration strategies—from TFVC & SVN to Git, from legacy stacks to modern pipelines
