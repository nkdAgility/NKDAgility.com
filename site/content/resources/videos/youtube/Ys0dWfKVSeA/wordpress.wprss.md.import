We tend to think that tools do the job for us, we simply need to select the correct tool or framework and 90% of the job is done. It doesn't work that way though, people solve problems, not tools, and so tools and processes matter but they don't matter as much as people and interactions.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the #scrumframework as a diagnostic and #productdevelopment framework rather than a silver bullet
