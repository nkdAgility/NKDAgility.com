1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,880
so scrum scrum doesn't solve problems it

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
reveals them how and why is that

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,960
valuable

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,560
um there's a there's a there's a there's

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,300
an old um adage that can can Weber used

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,320
to used to say all the time

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,480
and scrums like a mirror

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,080
oh it gives you a way of doing things

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,100
and if you can't do it that way

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,840
why that's your mirror right what is the

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,280
thing because it doesn't sound

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,600
unreasonable

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,520
right there's no there's nothing

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
unreasonable in scrum

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,020
you you have a group of people who are

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,579
working together towards a common goal

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,219
right they're a team working together

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,899
towards a common goal you you give them

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,660
some work

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,640
they take a piece of that work

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,260
they build that work and they deliver

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,840
that work

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,100
you take the feedback from people using

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,619
that work

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,180
and inform the next thing that you build

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,920
and you keep going around that Loop

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,880
right

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,880
why why is that so hard for organization

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,159
it it seems like a no-brainer right we

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,580
we do it all the time how did your your

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,439
kids learn to walk they fell over a lot

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,659
and they kept picking themselves up and

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,060
kept trying they would see other people

34
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,439
doing those things right they could see

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,979
other people doing those things the

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,180
walking I want to do that uh for for my

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,000
daughter

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,320
um we bought squeaky shoes I don't know

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,240
if you've ever seen these squeaky shoes

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,520
that's basically shoes with a squeaker

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,520
in it and that when you walk it goes

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,399
and she loved that noise so she learned

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,920
to walk it nine months with those shoes

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,840
on and she was running down concrete

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,000
concourses on holiday

46
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,180
um with those shoes

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,460
and it's just just you

48
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:05,340
that that that

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,860
mirror that other people are doing it

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,259
you have some incentive to do it and

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,900
then uh you get you get the outcome

52
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,400
right most organizations move to

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,959
adopting scrum because they're

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,260
struggling to deliver

55
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,540
right they've failed in some way to

56
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,060
achieve the desirable outcome and people

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,680
are like oh this sucks why is this

58
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,720
taking so long why are we building the

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,640
wrong thing how do we build the right

60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,140
thing and somebody's like well there's

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,819
this agile thing that people are talking

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,560
about they seem to be talking about

63
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,959
these short feedback loops delivering

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,760
more value maximizing that amount of oh

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,980
that sounds like a good idea let's do

66
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,319
that and then you go to try and do it in

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,200
your organization and suddenly all these

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,920
mirrors pop up and say you you know you

69
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,680
go to try a simplest one ever you go to

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,260
try and ship your product to production

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,840
and what what what happens the mirror

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,340
pops up and it's you can't ship to

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,500
production I'm sorry you have to fill

74
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,720
out these 14 forms

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,120
and you have to fill them out

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,640
minimum six weeks in advance before you

77
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,560
do a deployment there you go

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,720
well there's something we need to fix

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,700
right that's that's the first thing we

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,920
need to fix that that's an example I

81
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,620
used to work at Merrill Lynch uh and and

82
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,420
that's exactly if we didn't submit all

83
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,920
the paperwork six weeks before a

84
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,560
deployment it was considered an

85
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,780
emergency deployment and every emergency

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,599
deployment got a black mark against your

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,459
name against like uh in the hierarchy of

88
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,040
departments and if you get too many

89
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,900
black marks at a particular level

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,300
um then you know leadership comes down

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,700
to slap people around and and say why

92
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,980
why are you why are you doing this

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,500
um and the group that I worked for

94
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,120
because we were trying to do ideal

95
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,280
delivery we were doing continuous

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,080
delivery right so we were maybe shipping

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,599
twice a day

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,459
um we we had the more black marks than

99
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,560
any other part of the organization I

100
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,239
think it was somebody said it as we had

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,340
more black marks than the whole rest of

102
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,159
the organization combined

103
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,260
right because we were just

104
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,700
we're generating two or three of them a

105
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,260
day and that was just my products there

106
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,159
were other products in our in our group

107
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,080
as well

108
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,560
so so so that

109
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,299
then disincentivizes people to do the

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,859
right thing right why is the rest of the

111
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,299
organization not doing continuous

112
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,040
delivery well because they're not

113
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,259
willing to just go yeah whatever your

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
black marks right they didn't have

115
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,240
strong enough leadership who says to the

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
rest of the organization no this is fine

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
we're okay with this level of black

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,820
marks this is perfectly acceptable and

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
we're getting the value we need this is

120
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,680
okay

121
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,139
and and why did that exist why does that

122
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,199
black mark system exist it's it's

123
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,199
organizational cropped right our

124
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,600
organizations build up

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,639
a whole bunch of

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,040
um rules I'm gonna call them rules they

127
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,300
build up a whole bunch of rules because

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,460
they did something it worked well and

129
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,139
they wanted to enshrine that in the way

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,340
they do things so that they continue to

131
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,400
do well

132
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,979
and that idea worked fantastically when

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,320
we existed in slow-moving markets right

134
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,720
and you'll see the organizations with

135
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,880
the most bureaucracy are the

136
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,340
organizations that have traditionally

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,460
existed in the slowest moving markets

138
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,440
right governments right always had lots

139
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,919
of high levels of bureaucracy and rules

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,080
and procedures Banks right banks have

141
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,880
been around for well I think the First

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,940
Bank was was it not Royal Bank of

143
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,860
Scotland 250 years there's still an

144
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,280
organization still exists can you

145
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,620
imagine having 250 years of these rules

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
and procedures I worked with kongsberg

147
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,660
in Norway that's a 200 year old mining

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,600
company that found diamonds and then got

149
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,960
into everything right they have all

150
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,780
these rules so for example at Merrill

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,320
Lynch I had a rule that the software

152
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,660
that I create had to be tested to make

153
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,180
sure that it didn't interfere with the

154
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,039
trading desk software if it was

155
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,500
installed on the trading desk

156
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,360
but the software I was building was for

157
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,400
a small group of people in a call center

158
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,380
who were calling people and had nothing

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,100
to not even in the same

160
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,539
league as the trading desk folks so this

161
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,120
piece of software would never be

162
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:27,660
installed over there but yet I had to

163
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,880
spend six months in testing an

164
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,520
assessment to validate that that was

165
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,660
true even though it was of no relevance

166
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,940
whatsoever

167
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,680
that's a rule that's applied across an

168
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,160
entire organization for a very small

169
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
group now risk mitigation right if that

170
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,940
software was installed on the trading

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,919
desk and it interfered with it maybe

172
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,360
that's hundreds and hundreds of millions

173
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,520
of dollars worth of risk to the

174
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,620
organization so they applied across the

175
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,639
board but there needs to be a

176
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,259
reasonableness test right needs to be a

177
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,680
reasonable this text

178
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:04,380
across all of the the the

179
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,139
organization's rules so challenge that's

180
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,259
scrum's job is to challenge those rules

181
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,600
it pops up that mirror and says no you

182
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:14,639
should be able to do this you should be

183
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,960
able to do continuous delivery you

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,419
should be able to have an ordered

185
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,860
backlog that's just a list of stuff that

186
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,380
you need to do with the most important

187
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,380
thing at the top you should be able to

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,900
say product owner here's the product you

189
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,639
own it you make the decisions if you

190
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,900
can't do that there's a problem for

191
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,699
leadership

192
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,419
right that pops up that mirror

193
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:41,099
immediately we've got to fix this so

194
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:44,220
um the the whole purpose of scrum is not

195
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:45,599
to solve your problems for you it's to

196
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,860
highlight that you have them in the

197
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,840
first place

198
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,460
right it's a little trigger mechanism

199
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,960
that you can't do the short feedback

200
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,819
loop you can't deliver stuff into

201
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,740
production you can't get working

202
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,139
products you can't you can't you can't

203
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,340
you can't right that's that's I don't

204
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,919
know what to call that is that the art

205
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,780
of the negative I don't know like you

206
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,099
you I work with so many organizations

207
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,000
where

208
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,979
um

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
here's here's here's how I would expect

210
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,400
conversation to go

211
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,560
right um

212
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,259
we need to do this

213
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,400
we can't do this okay

214
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:22,680
how we can't do it that way but you if

215
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,319
you did this and you did that then you

216
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,020
would be able to do it this way or let's

217
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,419
pull in that compliance person that we

218
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,800
need to sign off on this so we can make

219
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,320
this change

220
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,640
because it's a business need right we

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
need to be able to ship more quickly

222
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,180
whereas what really happens in

223
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,680
organizations is you go oh we need to be

224
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,060
able to do this and the other person

225
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,060
goes nope you can't do that

226
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,000
that's the end of the conversation

227
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,019
how is that supporting the business

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,420
right

229
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,100
the the the whole purpose for every

230
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,740
Department in your organization's

231
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,779
existence is to support the business

232
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,060
making money

233
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,980
anything that's inhibiting the business

234
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,480
making money is getting in the way and

235
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,160
you need those mirrors

236
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,560
right devops

237
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,959
pops up those mirrors scrum pops up

238
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,680
those mirrors damn man pops up those

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,220
mirrors these are all tools to help you

240
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,440
see what's wrong because the way we do

241
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,040
things is the thing that's getting in

242
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,500
the way of actually delivering value
