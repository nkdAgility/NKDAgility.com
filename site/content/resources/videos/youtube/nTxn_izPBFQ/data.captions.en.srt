1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:14,040
so how how good is the pspoa course in

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,220
helping leaders determine product

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,800
Direction and why

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,260
well I for me this is one of those ones

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,180
where well it doesn't right leaders

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,560
should determine product Direction the

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,240
course isn't going to tell them how to

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,840
do that

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,020
um but there are tools

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,440
in the pspoa

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,559
that will help

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,219
leaders and product owners

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,219
understand

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,860
what are the things that they're not

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,460
doing that they probably should be doing

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,760
right a lot of

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,379
product owners are not great product

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,340
owners

19
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,860
only because they

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,439
aren't necessarily focused on the

21
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,720
breadth of product ownership

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:16,500
so for for example many product owners

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:19,260
Focus solely on the aspect of of being a

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,900
great customer advocate

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,420
right but in being a great customer

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,119
Advocate they sometimes leave the

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,880
innovator to the site whereas they

28
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,560
should be an innovator as well

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,600
and that

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,420
Gap

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,520
means that they're not

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,020
being the best product owner they can be

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,759
what what are those those gaps

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,079
um

35
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,380
yeah I was talking about the difference

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,640
between the customer advocate

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,799
and the the the the innovator

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,880
and

39
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:04,320
the product owners quite often

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,180
focus on just that one thing when they

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,819
should be focusing on many different

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:15,300
things in the pspoa we talk about six

43
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:18,000
possible focuses not maybe the only

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,400
focuses but six possible focuses of the

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,500
product owner and we talk about them as

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,140
the stances

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,480
of the product owner what what's the the

48
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,760
the the position that they take on a

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,440
particular topic and it's important to

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,720
mix and match although we talk about

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,459
them in isolation

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,400
um but we talk about we talk about the

53
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,040
Visionary or the Steve Jobs type right

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,160
you're you're trying to figure out what

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,319
the next big move is that's not

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,599
necessarily driven by customer demand

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
because customers might be demanding

58
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,379
this route but actually the next big

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,080
innovation is is over here how do you

60
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,140
how do you get to that

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,140
um

62
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,519
product owners need to focus on

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
they need they need a lot of people to

64
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,900
agree and understand what it is they're

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,519
doing right product owner is a very

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,260
political position

67
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,300
because you've you've got you're you're

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,300
being given money by the business to go

69
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,159
build successful products

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,840
and

71
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,000
if the business don't believe you're

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,640
building successful products they're not

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,560
going to give you any more money if key

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,800
stakeholders go moaning to the business

75
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,620
that you're not doing what they want you

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,019
might be in trouble of not getting money

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,780
if developers don't understand what it

78
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,400
is that you're trying to create and are

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,080
behind your vision they're not going to

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
be involved in it enough and you're not

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
going to be able to actually get there

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,180
and get across that line

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,379
so there's kind of this box of the

84
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,959
collaborator

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,299
right of of of connecting all of these

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
people understanding what they need I

87
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,200
think it should be called the politician

88
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,819
rather the collaborator right because

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319
you've got to get everybody going in the

90
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,879
same direction you've got a vision for

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,519
the product and how do you get everybody

92
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,440
behind it so that you can maintain uh

93
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,060
focus and direction

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,739
and I've kind of talked about the

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,739
customer representative that Relentless

96
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,439
customer focus as well that's important

97
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,019
right it's part of that story but also

98
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,540
just being able to make decisions I I

99
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,660
think there's a there's a there's a uh

100
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,259
is a parable is it a a it's a definitely

101
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,180
a phrase that's better to make a

102
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,560
decision that's wrong than not make a

103
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,900
decision at all

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,460
I've heard I've heard that before and

105
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,979
that's sometimes what a product owner

106
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,139
needs to do is there there are two ways

107
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:39,180
to build it and nobody can make a

108
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,919
decision and the product owner doesn't

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,060
have enough information so pick one and

110
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,160
try it

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,220
right pick one and try it or or pick

112
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,840
both and try a little bit of both right

113
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,639
just make a decision so that we can move

114
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,560
forward and if we move forward and we've

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,139
made the wrong decisions ah we made the

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,240
wrong decision let's go you know pull

117
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,400
back and go this other route that need

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,160
to be that decision maker

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,800
um and I talked about the experimenter

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,180
already right focusing on what's the

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,520
next big innovation so there's a

122
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,919
Visionary what's the next big innovation

123
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,560
but there's also this experimenter which

124
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,600
is what's what's the iterative

125
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,820
innovation of what it is we've created

126
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,479
what's the next little experiment we can

127
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,479
run to try and see whether

128
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,180
what we might get down the line and I

129
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,919
think bringing all of those together

130
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:35,220
as examples of what might be missing

131
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,199
from your role as a product owner or as

132
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,120
a leader in your business

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:45,060
helps open up those ideas and create a

134
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,100
deeper understanding of

135
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,020
what type of product owner people want

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,940
to be

137
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,740
and what direction they want to take

138
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,580
their business and their product and

139
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,080
their teams
