# How good is the PSPO-A course in helping determine product direction?

As a manager who gets promoted up the ranks, your trajectory has been determined by demonstrating competence with the systems of the organization and in your ability to perform your role.

What happens when the organization switches from traditional #projectmanagement to #agile #productdevelopment and your focus is now on product rather than project?

How do you become a product leader rather than a process leader? In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about how the Advanced Professional Scrum Product Owner course can help you think more effectively about the product vision, produt goal, and how to align teams of #agile teams around capturing value for customers.
