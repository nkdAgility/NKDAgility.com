00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,900
foreign

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,599
so the Sprint review Workshop

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,240
um it helps you

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
get the most out of what is one of the

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,320
most important events in scrum this is

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,600
this is the event when you engage with

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
your stakeholders where you find out

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,080
whether you're building the right thing

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,940
you're on track for me it is very much

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,559
uh marketing event I.E your team and

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,960
your product

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,420
um is being presented to stakeholders

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,940
and you want them to provide you with

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,739
their opinions and feedback on what it

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,180
is you're doing where you're going are

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,219
we missing anything that we don't

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,820
understand and that can be very

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,680
difficult and daunting for for teams and

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,140
product owners and product management to

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,800
to understand it requires a certain

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,140
level of of exposure right of revealing

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,780
yourself and how you work and how you do

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,780
things to perhaps your customer that can

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,760
be quite scary so the purpose of this

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,860
Workshop is to both help you understand

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,540
what it is what's supposed to happen and

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,700
what you're supposed to get out of this

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,259
event right that's that's the important

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,479
core

30
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,240
um but also here are a bunch of tools

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,299
and techniques that you can use that's

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,360
kind of the the the learning and core

33
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,799
Workshop part but then we're going to

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,220
help

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,979

36
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,900
Sprint review sessions and then we can

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,720
have a debrief afterwards where we

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,240
figure out did our tactics work right

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,640
the things we tried resonate with our

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,920
stakeholders what else could we try

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,579
based on the experience that we we we

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,280
