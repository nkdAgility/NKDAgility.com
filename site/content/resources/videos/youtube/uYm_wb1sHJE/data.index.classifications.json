    "reasoning": "The content is entirely focused on the Sprint Review workshop and its benefits for Agile teams, stakeholder engagement, and product development. At no point does the article mention, describe, or indirectly refer to Service Level Expectation (SLE) or any of its components (such as cycle time, probability-based forecasts, or explicit predictability metrics). There are no references to SLE calculation, usage, or its role in Agile or Kanban workflows. The few possible thematic overlaps, such as 'perpetual enhancement' and 'market alignment', are broad Agile values rather than specific to SLE as defined in the classification instructions. Depth and alignment to SLE are almost nonexistent. The intent serves general Agile/Scrum practitioners (audience), but with no focus on flow metrics or predictability in terms of SLE. The signal is sharply off from the target category. All scores are extremely low to reflect absence of topic relevance as required by the strict definition.",
