In today's fast-paced world, organizations often struggle to find the right metrics that drive success. Whether you're a manager, [product owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}), [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master, or CEO, the **Professional Agile [Leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) - Evidence-Based Management (PAL-EBM)** class provides valuable insights into how to navigate this critical aspect of your leadership journey.

From personal experience as a Scrum Trainer, I can wholeheartedly recommend the PAL-EBM class to anyone in a leadership role who is committed to steering their organization toward success. This class is not just for managers; it's for anyone in a position of influence who is seeking to understand how to use metrics effectively to foster growth and collaboration.

## Why PAL-EBM is for Everyone in Leadership

You might be wondering if the PAL-EBM class is for you. Here’s why it applies to anyone in a leadership position:

- 📊 **Managers**: Leading teams, departments, or entire organizations.

- 🏢 **Product Owners**: Managing products, ensuring their success.

- 🔄 **Scrum Masters**: Facilitating effective Scrum practices across teams.

- 🌟 **Leaders**: Influencing and driving change across organizations.

No matter your role, the key takeaway from the PAL-EBM class is the importance of understanding metrics—beyond just numbers on a dashboard—and how they can shape the future of your company.

### Learning Through Stories and Experiences

One of the things I love about this class is its approach to learning. We don’t just dive into theories or data; we use **stories and experiences** to make the learning stick. As humans, this is how we learn best: by connecting with real-world examples and engaging in meaningful discussions.

In the PAL-EBM class, you will be guided through stories that show why some commonly used metrics are ineffective. It’s not just about labeling a metric as “bad” or “good.” The real question is, **why aren’t the metrics working**? The class walks you through examples that help connect those dots and provides participants with epiphany moments about how they can make their organizations thrive by focusing on the right metrics.

### Realizing the Impact of Good Metrics

Almost every participant who takes the PAL-EBM class has a moment of realization. They suddenly understand what their organization is missing and why certain metrics are failing. It’s all about the people. When we focus on metrics that don’t consider human behavior, we lose out on valuable insights.

PAL-EBM emphasizes the importance of:

- 📈 **Monitoring trends and directions over time**.

- 🔄 **Iteratively adjusting** based on these trends.

- 🚦 **Using metrics to shape the organization’s direction**.

But it’s not just about success; it’s also about avoiding the pitfalls. One of the biggest challenges is recognizing the **negative behaviors** that emerge when we measure the wrong things.

### Watching Out for Negative Behaviors

Metrics can have unintended consequences. The PAL-EBM class provides plenty of examples of how certain metrics have backfired in organizations. One story that always stands out for me is about Microsoft and their **stack ranking** system.

#### Microsoft’s Stack Ranking Example

Microsoft used a metric called **stack ranking**. If you Google it, you’ll find plenty of other companies that also used this method, with equally poor results. Stack ranking required managers to rank their direct reports, with the bottom 10% being eliminated from the team—and after three strikes, from the company entirely.

💡 **Impact on Behavior**: The problem with stack ranking was the negative behaviors it encouraged. Instead of fostering collaboration and teamwork, it led to an environment of fear and competition, where employees worked against each other rather than towards a shared goal.

It’s easy to look back now and see the obvious flaws in this system. But at the time, it was policy for nearly a decade. The reason it took so long to change? Leaders were **clinging to beliefs** despite overwhelming evidence that it wasn’t working. This is where [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) and the ability to analyze empirical data comes into play—key elements of PAL-EBM.

### Transparency and Empirical Data

In PAL-EBM, we focus on creating **transparency** in our data systems. Too many decisions are made based on what leaders want to see, rather than what’s really happening. The class emphasizes the importance of building an empirical system where decisions are made based on **real data**, not fiction.

Transparency means seeing the full picture and being honest about what the data is telling you. In PAL-EBM, we practice how to set up these systems so that leadership teams can make informed, data-driven decisions that lead to better outcomes.

### Recommendations for Leadership Teams

While the PAL-EBM class is valuable for individuals, I can’t stress enough how transformative it is for **leadership teams** to take it together. I’ve facilitated several PAL-EBM sessions with leadership teams, and one comment I hear time and time again is, "These are the conversations we’ve never had time to have."

The class creates space for leadership teams to:

- 📊 **Discuss metrics and how to measure success**.

- 🎯 **Strategize toward the desired outcome**.

- 🧠 **Have deep conversations** that don’t normally happen in day-to-day operations.

#### Creating Space for Strategic Conversations

One example that sticks with me is a **CIO’s feedback** after a PAL-EBM session: “We’ve had these warning bells going off in the back of our heads, telling us we should be having these conversations, but we just never had the time.” The PAL-EBM class provides the environment to tackle these pressing issues and strategize a path forward.

By the end of the course, leadership teams leave with a clear vision of how to:

- 🧩 **Measure success**.

- 🔄 **Strategize iteratively** toward long-term goals.

- 🛠 **Use metrics effectively**, without fostering negative behaviors.

### In Conclusion: Why You Should Invest in PAL-EBM

If you’re serious about driving success in your organization, the PAL-EBM class offers the tools and insights you need to do just that. It’s not just about learning metrics; it’s about understanding the **human impact of metrics** and using them to guide your team in the right direction.

Whether you’re a manager, [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}), or CEO, the PAL-EBM class helps you:

- 🌟 **See metrics in a new light**.

- 👥 **Understand the impact of good and bad metrics**.

- 📊 **Create transparency and make data-driven decisions**.

- 🧠 **Engage in the strategic conversations you’ve been missing**.
