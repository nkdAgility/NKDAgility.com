1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:08,559
I would recommend the pal ebm class

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,719
really to anybody who works in a company

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,080
who wants to take it in a direction of

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,920
success so you could be a manager uh

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,160
managing a a team within your

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,640
organization you could be managing a

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,359
group of teams you could be managing a

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,279
whole product or you could

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,039
be CEO managing the whole

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,840
company um you could be a product owner

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,360
you could be um you could be a scrum

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,879
Master you could be a leader anywhere in

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,039
leadership in the organization the

14
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:46,000
the the P ebm class is designed to take

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,320
the

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,039
participants through a a a

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,879
story that enables understanding right

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,280
that's that's how how we as humans learn

19
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,120
best is to

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,960
experience and tell stories and engage

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,560
in some kind of activities um and the

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,799
PBM class is designed to take us through

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,000
those ideas about effectively why why

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,759
aren't our existing metrics uh that we

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,280
collect being successful right um what

26
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,000
is it about them that's being

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,159
unsuccessful so not just this one's bad

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,360
and this one's good right but what is

29
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,360
the underlying reason the people reason

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,680
why a lot of those metcs are

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,479
unsuccessful connecting those dots and

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,000
enabling the people in the group to

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,360
really understand the impact of having

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,360
good metrics almost almost every

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,200
participant I've had that goes through

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:52,479
the pal ebm has had Epiphany like

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,920
realizations about what they're not

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,840
doing in their organization that they

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,000
really should be doing right that they

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,719
really should be looking at these

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,159
metrics they really should be um um

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,039
iteratively looking at them over time

43
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,479
seeing the trend and Direction and using

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,840
metrics to shape the direction of the

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,200
organization while watching out for

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,160
negative behaviors caused in people by

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,280
monitoring those metrics right there's

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,840
lots of great examples out there of of

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,959
of of poor metrics we tell a lot of

50
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,560
those stories in the class right in the

51
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,680
PBM class the trainer tells a lot of the

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
the the stories of organizations out

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,280
there um a lot of that information is

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,080
publicly available as well that you can

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,440
find the the the those metrics that

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,319
we've always used right and the negative

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,560
impact that they've had on organizations

58
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,319
over the longer term that's not really

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,400
obvious in the short term but you do you

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,920
do something over five or 10 years in

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
your organization um and it it can be

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,239
absolutely detrimental to the way the

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
way that you do business uh one of the

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,680
stories that I always tell um for

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,239
leaders is is is is Microsoft Microsoft

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,599
used to have uh used to do stack ranking

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,760
if you Google stack ranking uh you'll

68
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,400
find a whole bunch of other

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
organizations that have also never been

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,319
successful using it in fact been wholly

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,599
unsuccessful using it uh but stack

72
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,480
ranking was this idea uh that you you as

73
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,040
a as a manager every manager in the

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,840
organization stack ranks every one of

75
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,599
their direct reports and the bottom 10%

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,200
is out of the out of the team right uh

77
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,760
and if you're in the bottom 10% three

78
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
times in a row you're out the company

79
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,720
and one of the things that we we engage

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,080
with is how would something like that we

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,680
have a lot of different scenarios but

82
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,680
how would something like that impact on

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,640
the behaviors of the people within the

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,159
organization right and and it's so

85
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,040
obvious in

86
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,640
hindsight the negative impact of those

87
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,640
types of metrics on behaviors of people

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,120
that you want to be be collaborating

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,560
together towards a common goal how would

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
this impact with them it's blatantly

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,560
obvious to

92
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,519
us the negative impact of that but then

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,320
why was it policy within Microsoft and

94
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,639
Engineering Organization for 10 years

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,799
right what why did they not change it

96
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,160
sooner and it took Satia coming along to

97
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,759
to to to to make that change and it's

98
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,240
cuz people cling onto their beliefs in

99
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,759
spite of the data the data is telling

100
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,280
them it's not going well and they cling

101
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,880
to it and part of uh uh pal ebm is

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,560
transparency right we're have an

103
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,240
empirical system for monitoring our data

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,240
so we want to be able to really see

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,000
what's going on see the real data and

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,680
then make decisions based on what's

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,960
really going on not the general fiction

108
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,320
that most business decisions are are are

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,000
are made on at the moment so that's why

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,400
I would recommend the pal ebm I would

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,680
heartily recommend it for individual ual

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,520
um but I would even more recommend it

113
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,320
for organization leadership teams to go

114
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,759
through together I've done that a number

115
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,720
of times with organizations and one of

116
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,120
the one of the comments that I got from

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,960
a from a um a CIO in in the P BM was

118
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,080
these are the conversations that we've

119
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,319
never had time to have right that that

120
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,960
we should have had before now that we've

121
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,080
all had that little little warning Bell

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,400
going off thinking we should have these

123
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,680
conversations and we've just not had

124
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,199
them

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
because we don't have time we don't have

126
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:44,600
the inclination we don't feel like we

127
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,919
can voice it and the class creates space

128
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,240
for leadership teams to really have

129
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,440
those deep conversations on how are they

130
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,360
going to measure success what does

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
success even

132
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,720
mean and how are they going to

133
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,759
iteratively strategize towards the

134
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,680
desired outcome if you want to a

135
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,360
