1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,420
so the question was why am I going the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,480
immersive trading route

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,480
um

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,740
because I want to do the thing that's

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,660
best for not just the students but their

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,480
ability to make changes in their

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,519
organization I I got into this training

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,300
thing for the same reason that I got

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:36,420
into the devops thing back in 2010 it's

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,420
that I I I saw that people and

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,160
um

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,559
organizations where where we're

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,300
struggling right people were struggling

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,460
and organizations weren't getting what

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,260
they needed so the organizations were

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,500
blaming the people and suddenly you've

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,219
got this vicious cycle and

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,699
um

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,980
devops helped Grease the wheels give

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,260
people more because you automate you

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,359
automate a lot of stuff away again I was

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,880
working with Azure devops and more from

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,820
a technical perspective and how do you

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,200
improve the flow of value delivery so

25
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,760
that then we have time to look

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,600
holistically and figure out what's going

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,939
on

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,640
and in doing that I think I said before

29
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,400
I I very quickly figured out that it

30
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,840
wasn't it wasn't actually the tools that

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,640
were the thing that was helping people

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,100
it was the different practices that

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,900
people were using and that led logically

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,320
towards

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,600
um the same this this idea of of agile

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,860
and scrum and kanban and those kind of

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,060
things as well

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,000
so this is that logical progression of

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,159
um we're we're using double Loop

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,880
learning in and of ourselves right our

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,119
our our the outcome of the training

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,720
styles that we've got is not the most

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,880
optimal for how people retain knowledge

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,100
learn and use that knowledge

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,399
people are much better in that practical

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,320
world so closing that loop again and

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,880
saying well we need to change How We Do

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,740
training

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
um and part of that was moving to the

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,959
flipped ish flipped learning experience

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,420
um and this is the the next progression

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,980
and I know that there are our trainers

53
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,340
out there that have been experimenting

54
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,780
with uh different learning formats and

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,660
this is starting to pull that

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,400
information together and what are the

57
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,080
best learning formats and not the best

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,500
that's probably the wrong word or what

59
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,940
are more effective learning formats for

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,640
people and how do we incorporate it into

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,099
the way we do things the the harder part

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,200
for us is that it's

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,340
um as a trainer right and as a business

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,860
owner is that it's actually going to be

65
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,080
less I'm going to have less time

66
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,540
to be able to do other training classes

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,060
right so instead of it being four half

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,760
days or four half days spread over a

69
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,099
couple of weeks or or you know four half

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,360
days spread over two days right it's

71
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,120
going to be

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,480
um eight half days so spread over

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
um eight weeks so in the time that it

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,140
takes me to deliver this I could have

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,959
delivered in the old format to food

76
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,940
classes but for me this is a better

77
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,099
experience for students if the students

78
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,019
are going to learn more and be more

79
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,300
effective then this type of training is

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,400
going to be more valuable

81
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,140
and it's providing value to the customer

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,620
that's the most important thing rather

83
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,140
than uh uh you know if if we just focus

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,060
on a revenue extraction model rather

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,280
than a value creation model then we're

86
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,300
not going to be able to I don't know

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,860
we're not going to be able to affect

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,260
change we're not going to be able to

89
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
have people look favorably on what it is

90
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,360
we're doing right we're not going to

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,799
have people

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,599
we both need to get something out of the

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,040
experience if companies are realizing

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,140
that they're not getting anything out of

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,540
the two two field days and even the four

96
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,860
half days is starting to not provide

97
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,599
them with the value that they'd really

98
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,519
like to get they're going to start

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,599
buying buying that trading and they're

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,640
not gonna they're all going to be able

101
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,040
to provide that to the people in their

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,860
organization and I think this is part of

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,840
that story of we want to deliver more

104
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,019
value to our customer even if it means

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,939
that it takes more time to to get there

106
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,919
and I think that for me is that that

107
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,239
that that piece from both sides both the

108
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,760
business side right because I'm running

109
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,320
a business as well as from the helping

110
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,320
people site it actually benefits both
