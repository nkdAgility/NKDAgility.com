As I embark on the immersive trading route, I find myself reflecting on the core reasons behind this shift. My journey into training began with a desire to address the struggles faced by individuals and organisations alike. Back in 2010, when I first delved into [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), I witnessed firsthand the challenges people encountered and the disconnect between their needs and what organisations were providing. This disconnect often led to a vicious cycle where organisations blamed their people for failures, rather than addressing the root causes.

### The Role of DevOps in [Value Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}})

DevOps was a game changer for many. It streamlined processes and automated repetitive tasks, allowing teams to focus on delivering value. My work with [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) highlighted that while tools are essential, it’s the practices surrounding them that truly make a difference. This realisation led me to explore agile methodologies, including [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) and [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}), which emphasise collaboration and [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}).

### Rethinking Training Approaches

Through my experiences, I recognised that traditional training methods often fall short in helping people retain and apply knowledge effectively. This insight prompted me to reconsider how I deliver training. The concept of double-loop learning became pivotal in my approach. It’s not just about teaching; it’s about ensuring that the training style aligns with how people learn best.

To enhance the learning experience, I’ve adopted a flipped-ish learning model. This approach allows for a more practical, hands-on experience, which I believe is crucial for effective learning. However, this shift comes with its challenges. As a trainer and business owner, I will have less time to conduct multiple training sessions. Instead of cramming four half-day classes into a short period, I’m opting for eight half-days spread over eight weeks. 

### Prioritising Value Over Revenue

This decision may seem counterintuitive from a business perspective, as it means fewer classes in the same timeframe. Yet, I firmly believe that providing a richer learning experience is worth the trade-off. If students can learn more effectively and apply that knowledge in their organisations, the value created far outweighs the immediate revenue concerns.

It’s essential to focus on a value creation model rather than a revenue extraction model. If organisations feel they’re not gaining enough from traditional training formats, they will seek alternatives. By prioritising the needs of the students and the organisations they represent, we can foster a more positive perception of our training offerings.

### A Win-Win Situation

Ultimately, this approach benefits both sides. From a business standpoint, investing in a more effective training model can lead to greater satisfaction and better outcomes for clients. When organisations see tangible results from their investment in training, they are more likely to continue seeking our services.

In conclusion, my commitment to delivering value through immersive training is rooted in a desire to effect real change. By embracing new learning formats and prioritising the needs of students, I believe we can create a more impactful training experience that resonates with both individuals and organisations.
