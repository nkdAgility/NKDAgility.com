# Why are you going the immersive Scrum training route?

scrum.org have pioneered a new format of #scrumtraining called #immersive learning, especially for #scrumcertification courses like the #professionalscrummaster and #professionalscrumproductowner courses.

It's a shift from the traditional 2-day course format to 4-day and 8-day course formats that include assignments, feedback sessions, and opportunities for people to ask questions about work they are implementing real-time.

Yup, it's pretty awesome.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why he is such a big fan of the new immersive learning format, and why he and NKD Agility are embracing the opportunity of developing the next level of scrum masters and product owners.
