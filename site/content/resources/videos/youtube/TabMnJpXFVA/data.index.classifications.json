However, nowhere in the content is Service Level Expectation (SLE) explicitly mentioned or even implied; there is no discussion about SLE's definition, calculation, use in forecasting or flow, or its supporting role in predictability. While Scrum and Kanban are referenced, they are mentioned in a general context about improving training and organisational learning, not in relation to SLE or flow metrics. Concepts like value delivery, continuous improvement, and helping organisations improve are present, but none of these are specifically tied to Service Level Expectation as defined for Agile, Scrum, or Kanban teams. As a result, all dimension scores are extremely low, with the only nonzero values attributed to minor audience overlap (the content does reference Agile practitioners) and a trace hint at relevant themes, but with no substantive conceptual or technical overlap with the SLE category.",

There is some alignment with the spirit of Ethos, particularly in the critique of revenue-driven models and the mention of authentic value, but these are not deeply explored or connected to lasting organizational transformation.
