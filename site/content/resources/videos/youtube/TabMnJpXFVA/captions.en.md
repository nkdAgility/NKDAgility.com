So the question was why am I going the immersive trading route? 

Because I want to do the thing that's best for not just the students but their ability to make changes in their organisation. I got into this training thing for the same reason that I got into the DevOps thing back in 2010. It's that I saw that people and organisations were struggling. Right, people were struggling and organisations weren't getting what they needed. So the organisations were blaming the people and suddenly you've got this vicious cycle. 

DevOps helped grease the wheels, give people more because you automate a lot of stuff away. Again, I was working with Azure DevOps and more from a technical perspective and how do you improve the flow of value delivery so that then we have time to look holistically and figure out what's going on. 

In doing that, I think I said before, I very quickly figured out that it wasn't actually the tools that were the thing that was helping people. It was the different practices that people were using and that led logically towards this idea of agile and scrum and kanban and those kind of things as well. 

So this is that logical progression of we're using double loop learning in and of ourselves. Right, the outcome of the training styles that we've got is not the most optimal for how people retain knowledge, learn and use that knowledge. People are much better in that practical world. So closing that loop again and saying, well, we need to change how we do training. 

Part of that was moving to the flipped-ish learning experience. This is the next progression and I know that there are trainers out there that have been experimenting with different learning formats and this is starting to pull that information together. What are the best learning formats? Not the best, that's probably the wrong word, or what are more effective learning formats for people and how do we incorporate it into the way we do things? 

The harder part for us is that it's, as a trainer and as a business owner, it's actually going to be less. I'm going to have less time to be able to do other training classes. Right, so instead of it being four half days or four half days spread over a couple of weeks or, you know, four half days spread over two days, right, it's going to be eight half days spread over eight weeks. 

So in the time that it takes me to deliver this, I could have delivered in the old format two food classes. But for me, this is a better experience for students. If the students are going to learn more and be more effective, then this type of training is going to be more valuable. 

It's providing value to the customer. That's the most important thing rather than, you know, if we just focus on a revenue extraction model rather than a value creation model, then we're not going to be able to affect change. We're not going to be able to have people look favourably on what it is we're doing. Right, we're not going to have people. 

We both need to get something out of the experience. If companies are realising that they're not getting anything out of the two field days and even the four half days is starting to not provide them with the value that they'd really like to get, they're going to start buying that training and they're not going to be able to provide that to the people in their organisation. 

I think this is part of that story of we want to deliver more value to our customer even if it means that it takes more time to get there. I think that for me is that piece from both sides, both the business side, right, because I'm running a business, as well as from the helping people side. It actually benefits both.
