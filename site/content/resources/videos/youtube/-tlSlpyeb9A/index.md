 🛤️ Evolving the Definition of Done Over Time
🎥 Episode 8 of 10 — Now Live

📍 Start small. Grow smarter.

A perfect Definition of Done doesn’t happen on Day One.
You don’t launch with perfection.
You build toward it—incrementally, deliberately, strategically.

✅ At first, “done” might just mean usable
Then you add:
🔁 Automated tests
📡 Telemetry
🔐 Security
🧾 Compliance
🚀 Continuous deployment

Each improvement = stronger increments.
Each step = more trust, better quality, greater resilience.

At NKD Agility, we help teams evolve their Definition of Done:
→ Without overwhelming people
→ Without stalling progress
→ Without sacrificing outcomes
Because done is a journey—not a checkbox.
