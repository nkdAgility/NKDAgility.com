1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,000
if you're hiring an agile coach uh one

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,160
of the most important things to consider

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,880
is their ability to

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,199
engage and gain credibility with the

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,439
teams the people uh that they're

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,400
coaching so agile coaches generally work

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,080
with both teams and Leadership uh but if

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,640
they're going to be working with teams

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,480
they need to understand what it is that

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,360
those teams do uh they need deep

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,280
technical knowledge in the processes

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,840
practices and tools that those teams are

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,840
using so that they can more effectively

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,840
help them um get better at agile
