If you're hiring an agile coach, one of the most important things to consider is their ability to engage and gain credibility with the teams, the people that they're coaching. Agile coaches generally work with both teams and leadership, but if they're going to be working with teams, they need to understand what it is that those teams do. They need deep technical knowledge in the processes, practices, and tools that those teams are using so that they can more effectively help them get better at agile.
