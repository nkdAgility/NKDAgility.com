1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,359
so I I believe uh that immersive

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,920
learning is is the future of I I think

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,679
almost all um of this type of learning

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,160
uh whether it's scrum or Canan or

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,600
anything where people are involved

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,760
you've got a high degree of complexity

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,920
this is different from tools training

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,760
right different from tools training um

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,519
but anytime you you're you're talking

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,920
about um processes and practices that

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,600
people have to organize around I think

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:42,200
the immersive learning approach um is

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,039
much more the future of the way that

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,520
learning should be happening um it's

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,079
very difficult for people to spend uh uh

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,960
two days or four half days in a in a

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,000
class and then be able to go back into

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,719
their organization and actually actually

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,160
change something right it's it's very

20
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,079
difficult cuz they'll go to try and

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,400
change something in their organization

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,119
and they'll run into all of these

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,119
roadblocks all of these things that get

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,840
in the way and there's nobody there to

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,159
help and support them because you know

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
we did the training a couple of weeks

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,759
ago and now we're doing this and and we

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,280
run into those roadblocks so the the the

29
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:24,159
immersive format allows people to keep

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,280
coming back around and having those

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
questions having them answered

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,560
especially the the longer immersive uh

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,600
stories so the the they six to 6 to 10

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,520
weeks um and collaborating around with

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,840
that group of people bringing those

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,040
learnings back to the

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,880
organization this this is a total game

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,520
Cher for the learning experience that

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,240
people get when they come to these uh

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,759
these types of classes um so definitely

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
um the future of scrum training is

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,240
immersive if you want to have a

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,479
discussion about how mive classes can

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,320
revolutionize your training experience

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,399
