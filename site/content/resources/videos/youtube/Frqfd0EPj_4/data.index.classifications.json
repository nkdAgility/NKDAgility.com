The intent is to promote immersive training for Scrum—an adjacent but not related topic—and the target audience (Scrum practitioners, trainers) does not shift the core intent toward SLE. The content stays tightly focused on immersive education, giving it a fairly clean signal-to-noise ratio, but none of its signal is on SLE.
