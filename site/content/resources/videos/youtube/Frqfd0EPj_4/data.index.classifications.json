The intent is to promote immersive training for Scrumâ€”an adjacent but not related topicâ€”and the target audience (Scrum practitioners, trainers) does not shift the core intent toward SLE. The content stays tightly focused on immersive education, giving it a fairly clean signal-to-noise ratio, but none of its signal is on SLE.
