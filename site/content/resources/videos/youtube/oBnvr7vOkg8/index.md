**How does someone become an Agile consultant?**

## Navigating the Journey to Becoming an Agile Consultant

Being an Agile and Scrum coach, the question, "How does someone become and Agile consultant," is a pretty popular one, and I'd like to add that this isn't an easy question to answer, as the journey to becoming an Agile Consultant isn't at all a straightforward path and is different for everyone. 🌱

As this is such an important question, I believe this article is essential as I explain the process, detailing how one goes from being a professional in a specific field to a competent and effective Agile Consultant.

I know the importance of mastering your domain and industry before applying Agile principles, and keep in mind the need to underline the significance of context and abstraction.

In the article, I give an inside look into real-world Agile consulting experiences and practices, and I hope this insight guides you through the step-by-step process of becoming an Agile Consultant in your chosen industry.

### Understanding the Agile Path

Very few professions don't have a clear guide on how to become that professional, and this is why I often ask, "How does one become an Agile consultant?

Well, it's not as straightforward as having the desire to simply declare, "I'm going to be an Agile consultant," but rather, it's a complicated process.

I'd also like to point out here that your journey to becoming an Agile Consultant must begin with being good at your profession and your job, and I mean _really_ good. Agile is not a standalone concept but a compilation of ideas and practices that you add to what you're already doing to make it more effective. 🌱

### Expertise is Key

As with any profession being an Agile Consultant experience is crucial.  Agile, just like Lean, is not the main event, but it is part of the process. You need to be competent in the work you're focusing on and then integrate Agile practices. The same applies to Lean. The crux here is that you should be adept in the actual work that you're doing.

Once you've achieved this, only then can you apply Agile or Lean methodologies and be recognised by others around you as someone who understands these practices well and can confidently become an Agile Consultant. 🔑

### Being Seen As an Agile Expert

As with many professions, the perception of how others perceive your professionalism plays a significant role. Being an Agile Consultant is no different, meaning that as you demonstrate your understanding of Agile practices and how they can be used to optimise work, others start recognising you as an Agile expert.

Don't underestimate the encouragement from those around you.  Being recognised for your talent can spur you to do more and gradually, you'll find yourself becoming an excellent Agile Consultant. 👀

### Building Foundations

I want to stress that my background is in software development, so I must highlight that your Agile Consultant journey should start within your field of expertise. And I cannot stress the danger of taking on a role as an Agile consultant in an industry that you are unfamiliar with.

Here's a perfect example, I have never worked in a car factory, so it would not make sense for me to serve as an Agile consultant within that particular industry.

Begin within your area of expertise, accumulate knowledge and experience, and then, you can extrapolate from there, moving forwards towards your goal of becoming an Agile Consultant. 🚀

### Abstraction Know-How

Abstraction is the hidden art of Agile Consulting, as becoming an Agile consultant is not merely about gaining experience; it's about abstraction. You must understand your work so deeply that you can separate the Agile and Lean story from the work.

You should discern how these methodologies impact and affect your particular area of expertise. Once you've gained enough experience in a specific context, you can help and advise outside that context.

## Beyond Agile

Allow me to share an intriguing experience I had in 2016 while conducting training for the Ghana Police Service.   As you can imagine, this training area was entirely new for me and I had no idea how to train anyone in the police service.

Thank goodness the training was not related to software but focused on how Scrum could be used for enacting organisational change.

This experience shows the benefits and application of Agile that can be effective in any industry worldwide.  While I did have a very limited knowledge of policing, it was fascinating and inspiring to me to see the attendees trying to contextualise Agile principles in their line of work.  🌍

### Applying Agile and Lean Everywhere

One of the key takeaways in this article is that you will need to be an Agile consultant within your line of work long enough to abstract ideas that would work in any context. Only then can you consult on them even if you don't know the core context, and this ability requires years of experience to develop, so be patient and hone your skills. 🌐

### Find Your Niche

Here's some advice from me on an example for aspiring Agile Consultants to break into the industry of Agile and Scrum.  Perhaps, you've spent the last 20 years working in finance. It makes sense then that your Agile consulting journey should start within the financial industry.  🚀

So, to begin with, start by figuring out how to bring Agile and Lean practices into the financial industry. After gaining enough experience, you'll be ready to venture into another industry because the same principles apply.
