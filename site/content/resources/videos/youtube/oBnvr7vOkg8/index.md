# How does someone become an agile consultant?

#agile has proven itself a reliable, super productive and collaborative approach to #productdevelopment in complex environments. It's a far shift from traditional #projectmanagement and organizations often need to invest in an #agileconsultant or #agilecoach to help them make the transition.

It is a critical role that involves elements of training, coaching, consulting, and mentoring. You need to help your clients identify the right problems and guide them toward the most effective solutions if you are going to make a significant impact in #agileconsulting.

So, how do you do that? How do you become a powerful #agileconsultant?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood sheds some light on possible avenues to becoming an #agileconsultant.
