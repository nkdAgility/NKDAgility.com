1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,860
oh that's a great question so how does

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,860
somebody become an agile consultant

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,820
well I don't think I don't think well

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,000
become that's probably the the linchpin

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,000
there

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,000
it's really hard a hard question because

7
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,460
you have to be

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,340
good

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,219
at something

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,440
right agile is not the thing that we're

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,360
doing

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,879
agile is a bunch of ideas practices that

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,940
you bring along to the thing that you're

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,100
doing in order to make it more effective

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,260
right you can say the same about lean

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,719
how do you become good at lean well you

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,579
have to be good at the thing that you're

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,760
focusing on with lean

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,739
and then you bring in lean practices you

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,299
apply it to the actual work that you're

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,680
doing you bring in add your practice you

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,460
apply it to the actual work that you're

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,040
doing

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,860
you get

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,479
seen by people around you as

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,340
understanding some of these things more

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,680
and how those things interconnect and

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,360
how we can maybe change and shift the

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,920
way we work in order to become more

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
optimal

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,360
um and those people that recognize you

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,700
as as doing that encourage you to do

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,500
more of it you do more of it and

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,960
suddenly you're an agile or devops

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,479
consultant right that's that's that's

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
how you become that thing it's not like

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,820
it's uh uh

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,520
I can just go well I'm going to be an

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,939
agile consultant for

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,100
um I don't know a car factory

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,960
right I'm not gonna go do that because

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,579
I've never worked in a car factory I

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,280
don't understand all the Nuance of how

44
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,200
car factories work that would be a dumb

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,320
idea to have me as an agile consultant

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,060
or a lean consultant for a car factory

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,240
my background and expertise is in

48
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,280
software right you you you you be a

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,920
software engineer for 10 years you be a

50
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
devops consultant for 10 years and then

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,720
maybe you have enough knowledge and

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,959
experience and stories and or currencies

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,239
and understanding on how to link those

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,000
how to abstract it's really about

55
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,560
abstraction right you're at you you need

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,680
to understand the thing you're doing

57
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,000
enough to abstract

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,700
the agile and lean story from the work

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,800
see how it impacts and affects it in

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,860
your particular expertise

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,200
and then perhaps you could go help and

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,959
advise outside of that context right

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,819
because you've then got 10 years of

64
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,160
helping and Advising in a particular

65
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,819
context go help and advise in another

66
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,459
context so for example

67
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,019
um I think it was 20

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,700
16

69
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:05,640
2016 I did uh some

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,620
uh Coke some training for the Ghana

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,019
Police Service

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,640
so this was training line police

73
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,220
officers

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,280
um they were not by any stretch of the

75
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,200
imagination software focused not not no

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,200
software skills whatsoever

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,500
and they wanted to understand how they

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,620
could use scrum

79
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,780
to enact organizational change

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,959
right so instead of the scrum being the

81
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,659
the product is the organization

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,040
how do we enact organizational change

83
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:41,459
over a long period of time and

84
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,980
incrementally uh change the organization

85
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,480
so that and then we see the results what

86
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,819
data do we need to look at to monitor

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,340
the feedback and increase that and part

88
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,239
of that was the the new Inspector

89
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,720
General of police uh used to work for

90
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:01,140
um uh Interpol an Interpol use scrum

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,480
apparently right I no no no no clue in

92
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,940
what context but he wanted to bring some

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,299
of those stories into the way he was

94
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,799
doing things in in Ghana and that

95
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,080
experience of

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,480
I was very clear when I was doing the

97
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,060
training I'm like everybody be I want

98
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,799
you all to be very clear I know nothing

99
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,800
about policing

100
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,460
accept what I've seen on TV which is

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
probably woefully incorrect right

102
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,080
um and what what was interesting was

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,780
while we were really talking about how

104
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,759
organizational change worked

105
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,560
um the head of CID

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,020
uh which if you don't know what c idea

107
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,120
is it's the the detectives right they're

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,040
they're solving the the the complex

109
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,680
cases the murders and the stuff like

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,419
that the head of CID

111
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,160
um was engaging me in lots of

112
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,979
conversations about what but how would I

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,600
apply this to solving a case right so we

114
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,280
had to talk about

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,259
you know I'm giving them information

116
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,759
about how this would work in my world

117
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,979
and he's trying to figure out how does

118
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,259
he apply that in his world right because

119
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,759
it's completely different and I can't

120
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,500
tell him how to do that because I don't

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,139
know how he does his work

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,240
and that's that that piece is it you

123
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,620
need to

124
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,840
be an agile

125
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:21,000
or or a consultant within your context

126
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,520
for long enough that you can see the

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,340
abstracted ideas that would work in any

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,419
context and then you can consult on them

129
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,139
even if you don't know the core context

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,699
that takes years of of of experience of

131
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,139
doing that to be able to get that

132
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,539
abstraction level to be able to work in

133
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,180
another in our department so for example

134
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:45,000
if you've spent the last 20 years

135
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,039
working in finance where should you be

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,380
an agile in devops and not devops right

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,479
but agile and lean consultant

138
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,419
um in the in the in the financial space

139
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,600
right look at Finance teams delivering

140
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,900
the stuff that Finance teams deliver

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,940
and figure out how to how to bring some

142
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,800
of those ideal practices into there do

143
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,440
that for long enough and then you'll

144
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,020
have the experience to go into another

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,360
uh uh um industry and do the same thing

146
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,620
because the same stuff applies right you

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,240
just need enough knowledge and

148
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,240
experience to be able to abstract it

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,080
