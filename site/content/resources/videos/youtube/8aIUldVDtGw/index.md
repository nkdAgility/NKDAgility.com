In today's fast-paced business environment, there's often a misconception that the more tasks we juggle, the more productive we are. However, as many successful teams have realized, this couldn't be further from the truth. A popular quote from Lean methodology sums it up perfectly: **"Stop starting and start finishing."** This philosophy emphasizes the importance of focusing on completing work, rather than constantly starting new tasks.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore why this mindset is critical for Scrum teams and how implementing it can significantly improve efficiency, productivity, and overall business value.

## **The Cost of Multitasking: A Cognitive Drain**

### **More Work ‚â† More Productivity**

A common fallacy is that **the more work we have in progress, the more productive we are.** This mindset is particularly prevalent in teams where members are often juggling multiple tasks at once. However, this approach leads to reduced efficiency and an increase in **context switching**‚Äîthe mental effort required to shift from one task to another.

As explained by **Gerald Weinberg** in his book _Systems Thinking_, each additional task or project underway causes about a **20% loss in productivity**. For example:

- Two tasks = 20% productivity loss

- Three tasks = 40% productivity loss

This loss occurs because our brains waste cognitive energy switching between tasks rather than focusing on solving core problems.

**Key takeaway**: The more tasks you're juggling, the less effective you become at completing any of them.

### **The Impact of Context Switching**

When you‚Äôre juggling too many tasks, your brain is constantly **context switching**. Instead of focusing on the problem at hand‚Äîone that could add significant value to the business‚Äîyour mind is preoccupied with managing multiple priorities.

For instance, how often have you found yourself in the shower thinking, ‚ÄúHow do I balance these three projects and keep all stakeholders happy?‚Äù When you‚Äôre stuck in this loop, you're not solving problems that directly benefit your business. Instead, you‚Äôre merely trying to keep multiple balls in the air, and that‚Äôs not where the real value lies.

üëâ **Pro Tip**: Focus on finishing a single project to completion before jumping to the next one. Your business cares about outcomes, not how many tasks you‚Äôre managing at once!

## **The Role of Leadership in Pushing Multiple Priorities**

While it may seem like leadership is always pushing for more work to be completed simultaneously, it's often **middle management** that applies this pressure. Middle managers, who are accountable for team performance, sometimes mistakenly believe that more tasks underway means more progress is being made.

However, this approach often results in:

- **Burnout** among team members

- **Inefficiency** due to context switching

- **Slower delivery times** as tasks pile up without being completed

**In Scrum**, one of the core principles is to have a **single Product Owner** who prioritizes the backlog and funnels the work. This singular focus ensures that teams aren't overwhelmed by conflicting demands from various stakeholders.

## **Scrum and Lean: Aligning for Maximum Efficiency**

**The Single Product Owner**

In Scrum, the **Product Owner** acts as a **funnel** to manage competing priorities and ensure the team focuses on delivering value. This role is critical for avoiding the chaos of multitasking and allowing the team to focus on one project or task at a time.

While Lean doesn't necessarily assign this role to an individual, it does advocate for a **definition of workflow** that limits work in progress (WIP). By clearly defining how much work a team can handle at any given time, Lean practices also help teams focus on finishing tasks rather than constantly starting new ones.

### **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**

Both Scrum and Lean methodologies emphasize the importance of **limiting WIP**. When teams attempt to do too many things at once, they inadvertently extend their cycle time‚Äîthe total time it takes from starting a task to finishing it.

One way to visualize this is through a **Cumulative Flow Diagram** (CFD), which shows the difference between the amount of work started and the amount of work finished. When the gap between these two lines grows, it‚Äôs a clear indicator that too much work is being started and not enough is being completed.

üëâ **Pro Tip**: Regularly review your team‚Äôs CFD to ensure that the gap between work started and work finished remains narrow. This helps maintain shorter cycle times and ensures that business value is delivered faster.

## **How to Prioritize Effectively**

### **Focus on Value, Not Age**

A common mistake teams make is prioritizing tasks based on how long they‚Äôve been sitting in the backlog. While this might seem like a fair approach, it‚Äôs not necessarily the best for delivering business value. Instead, focus on **value-based prioritization**‚Äîpicking the tasks that will deliver the most value to the business and completing them first.

When teams focus on value, they can:

- Deliver high-impact features quickly

- Maximize business ROI

- Shorten cycle times, leading to quicker wins and a more predictable delivery schedule

## **Stop Starting, Start Finishing: Why It Matters**

At the end of the day, the key to high-performing teams is simple: **stop starting work and start finishing it**. When teams focus on finishing tasks, they can reduce cycle times, improve throughput, and deliver more value to the business in a shorter amount of time.

### **Benefits of Finishing Work Before Starting New Tasks:**

- **Increased productivity** by reducing context switching

- **Faster delivery** times for business-critical features

- **Greater focus** on delivering value to the business

- **Predictability** in delivery timelines, giving stakeholders confidence in the team

### **How to Implement This Mindset:**

- **Limit WIP**: Only allow a set number of tasks to be in progress at any given time.

- **Focus on value-based prioritization**: Pick tasks that deliver the highest value to the business and complete them before starting new ones.

- **Monitor cycle times**: Use tools like Cumulative Flow Diagrams to ensure that work is being finished at a steady pace.

## **Conclusion**

The principle of **stop starting and start finishing** isn‚Äôt just a Lean idea‚Äîit‚Äôs a universal truth that applies to all teams, whether they‚Äôre practicing Scrum, Lean, or another framework. By focusing on finishing work before starting new tasks, teams can avoid the cognitive drain of multitasking, improve efficiency, and deliver greater value to the business.
