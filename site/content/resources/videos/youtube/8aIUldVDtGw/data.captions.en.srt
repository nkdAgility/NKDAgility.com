1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,679
there's a quote in um lean uh that's

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,120
stop starting and start

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:14,360
finishing um and it it's been around for

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,640
for quite some time it's something that

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:23,119
I use all the time with scrum teams as

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,119
well it's while it is predominantly a a

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,840
lean thing there's no reason why you

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,320
can't have lean stuff in empirical stuff

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,520
right there's no reason why those two

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,040
things can't go together and I think

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,600
it's really important for teams that are

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
doing anything right so we're we're

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,960
whatever type of work that we're doing

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,640
that we focus on finishing stuff not on

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,039
starting more stuff the

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,480
traditional kind of um idea is that the

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
more work or the fallacy is that the

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,920
more work we have underway the more that

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,079
we're doing which means that that people

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,840
people and teams people as well often

21
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,280
have they're juggling multiple things in

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,240
what it is that they do and when you're

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,720
juggling multiple things you tend to

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,640
find that less stuff gets done because

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,159
you spend a bunch of cognitive Cycles

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,960
context switching so if you think of the

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,560
the the work that uh Gerald Weinberg did

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,600
in his book systems thinking um you

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,479
might be um you might think of the

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,000
there's a graph that he has that has the

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,200
the number of projects and that are

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,600
underway and the amount of time that we

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,880
lose to contact switching and it's about

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,439
20% per thing so if you're doing two

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,040
things at once you're going to going to

36
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,920
lose 20% of your time that's just gone

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,560
right and it's it's gone to contact

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,200
switching it's gone to your cognitive

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,479
load it's gone to um you know you're

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,280
you're you're you're in the

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,960
shower in the morning and in instead of

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,719
the back of your brain solving the

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,000
complex cognitive problems that will

44
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,119
help your business be successful you the

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,080
back of your brain is sitting thinking

46
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,280
of uh how do I juggle these two projects

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,280
or these three projects how do I make

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,080
sure that I keep these three projects

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,879
worth of stakeholders happy how do I

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,640
juggle these these these things and if

51
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,560
the back of your brain is thinking about

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,200
how it would juggle those things you're

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,440
spending less time and less focus on

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,599
solving the actual problem that we're

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,239
here to solve that actually provides

56
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,160
your business with value there's no

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,040
value to your business in juggling

58
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,720
juggling five things right that your

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,440
business doesn't give a [ __ ] about that

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,640
all they care about is am I getting the

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,840
value that I expect to get um but there

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,599
is a big push especially from from from

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,360
especially from does leadership really

64
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,760
push this I think there's a little bit

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,200
of a fallacy there I don't think

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,000
leadership pushes it I think middle

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,680
management pushes it because middle

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,400
management is under pressure to get more

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,799
stuff done and if you're sitting on a

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,640
team and you have multiple Masters right

71
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,920
you've got multiple people telling you

72
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,840
what to do then um you're the one who

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,799
has to juggle those multiple things

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,920
whereas one of the things that we we

75
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,640
talk about in in in

76
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,319
scrum is having a single product owner

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,840
and that single product owner is that

78
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,239
that Focus for um um what are we going

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
to do next what are we working on um and

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
they become a little bit depending on

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,640
the way your organization is structured

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,360
this is not ideal right but if you have

83
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,480
that multiple voices in your

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,080
organization then the product owner

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,200
becomes the funnel that allows the team

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,200
to H to work on a single stream right

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,879
whereas the product owner has to deal

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,319
with all the different stakeholders and

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
and I'm not saying the team's not going

90
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,560
to help the rest of the developers are

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
going to going to help with that but the

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,599
product owner becomes that final say

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,519
that point of uh um that loom knitting

94
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,200
together all those uh different ideas

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,280
and threads into a into a single cookies

96
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,200
of story so that the team has has has

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,920
focus and can maximize the value and

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,280
lean talks about this as well but it

99
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,880
talks about having a definition of

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,239
workflow right if you're thinking of

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,720
cban a campan strategy you're going to

102
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,720
have that that definition of your

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,680
workflow you decide what it's going to

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,440
be and you're effectively going to

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,960
decide those things as well like

106
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,160
what things do we work on we're going to

107
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,919
limit our work in process for sure right

108
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
we're going to do that but then how do

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
we decide which thing we pick um and a

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,160
lot of teams pick the oldest thing

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,600
whatever the thing that's been hanging

112
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,039
around the longest is the thing we're

113
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,240
going to pick and then from the options

114
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,800
right the stuff we haven't started yet

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,479
we're going to going to perhaps order

116
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,440
that by whatever we decide as the team

117
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,639
right that maximizes the value so you

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,520
might order it by you might order it by

119
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,240
age not sure that's the best idea or

120
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,919
order it by value would be best right

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,960
have the highest value stuff we're going

122
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,800
to pick next and then we pull Things

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
based on based on that value and that

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,639
need um

125
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,680
so lean focuses on perhaps that idea of

126
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,840
the virtual product

127
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,560
owner for that for creating that Loom

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,759
right the virtual Loom to manage the

129
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,960
threads

130
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,840
um whereas scrum talks about it as an

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,880
individual a person who's going to going

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,440
to do that but the outcome is the same

133
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,919
you have a a a much tighter cohesive

134
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,440
story and focus for the team which is

135
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,919
really important and that's why we need

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,680
to um stop starting work and start

137
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,520
finishing work because ultimately the

138
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,120
more work we we we have in progress the

139
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,120
longer it takes to deliver and you can

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,800
see that if if you ever um used a a a

141
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,680
cumulative flow um diagram you can very

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,880
clearly see see when uh the lines you're

143
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,800
the amount of work you're starting and

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,360
the amount of work you're finishing when

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,199
when it gets further apart the amount of

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
uh uh things that you have in progress

147
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,599
right is increasing so the ver a

148
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,039
vertical line from the um uh the

149
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,120
starting line to the Finishing Line I

150
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,520
know you might have other lines in

151
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,880
between colorcoded right but from the

152
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,639
first start to the end that vertical

153
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,440
line I think it's the vertical line yeah

154
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,720
the vertical line is the the number of

155
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,520
items that you have in progress right so

156
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
if you you you count the items between

157
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,639
there so if you're getting further apart

158
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,639
then you're you're you're starting more

159
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,960
work than you're finishing and if the

160
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,680
lines are getting further apart then the

161
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,120
horizontal line is also getting further

162
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,759
further apart right and the horizontal

163
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,479
line is your approximate average cycle

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,840
time so as you start more things and you

165
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,479
haven't finished

166
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,240
them all of the things that are in the

167
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:04,440
system take longer to deliver and that's

168
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,599
not what we want we want to we want to

169
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,440
have as short uh um a a time that we're

170
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,680
working on things as possible because

171
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,520
that

172
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,319
increases the the the throughput right

173
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,400
the stuff delivered for the business and

174
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
if we're focused on valuable stuff it

175
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,680
hopefully maximizes the value that we're

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,520
delivering to the business and we can go

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,720
through that process really quickly

178
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,919
which means the business gets

179
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,400
predictability because they know if they

180
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,319
give us a thing onto our onto our H uh

181
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,879
um an important thing and we take it on

182
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,720
immediately they know roughly how long

183
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,199
it's going to take to deliver it right

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
because it's and it will be short

185
