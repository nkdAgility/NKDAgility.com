1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,740
so the the the question is what is a

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,000
scrum master

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,639
and I think that's really interesting

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,839
because I I think of a scrum Master as a

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,600
guide

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,640
right so so perhaps scrum guide would be

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,160
a better name however that's taken by

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,439
something else right but they they

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,300
they're there to

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,980
um they're they're somebody with with

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,160
deep

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,660
technical understanding of what agile is

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,960
the the the the different agile

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,239
practices of empiricism of lean I'll

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,020
lean agile practitioner right and

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,300
they're there to help guide the team so

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,039
that they have the knowledge tools and

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,260
skills to make the best decisions they

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,940
can within the context that they're

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,280
making those decisions

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,520
so it really helps if the the the the

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,800
scrum master has understanding of that

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,019
context right I usually think of it as

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,920
there's three contexts that this scrum

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,140
Master should understand there's the the

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,860
business context right because they've

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,900
got to help the the product owner

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,880
build the right product and they've got

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,260
to help the business understand why they

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,820
need scrum in the first place like what

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,400
does it mean to them he has to be able

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,920
to speak their language

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,200
um she also needs to

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,900
um really understand the technical

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,180
domain of what it is the team is doing

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,340
right what are they doing why are they

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,979
doing it if it's this is if this is a

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,259
software context then I would expect

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,259
them to understand what devops is how

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,939
devops functions why devops what are the

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,759
different tools and practices that a

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,140
team could be using to help improve the

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,560
way they do things because not everybody

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,540
knows right that's uh not true and the

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,500
other one is organizational change

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,000
context so understood standing uh beta

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,340
codex understanding taylorism

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,119
understanding

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,280
um uh follett's work understanding how

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,899
we can organize around solving

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,099
particular problems so that they can

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,440
have those explanations and

53
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,319
conversations with the organization and

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
with leaders ship and with teams and

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,200
people on the ground and people high up

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,780
in the clouds right we've got to have

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,599
the conversations everywhere in order to

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,239
have everybody understand why is it that

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,480
we're moving in a particular direction

60
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,900
and I think all of that stuff being

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,940
missing is why we're seeing a lot of uh

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,280
scrum Masters being let go in

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,620
organizations because they're not able

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
to demonstrate to the organization the

65
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,440
value that they're providing because

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,540
they are absolutely essential

67
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,519
to uh to a team in an organization's

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,400
ability to deliver

69
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,260
it may be that you you you you work on a

70
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,580
team and you're thinking oh but but we

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,660
don't have a scrum master and we're

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,160
doing great right you probably have what

73
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,599
I would call a virtual scrum Master

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,660
right you've probably got a a Gestalt of

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,819
the team understanding within the body

76
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,800
of the people doing the work of the

77
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,659
business of the organization of change

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,480
of the product of everything and you're

79
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,459
able to create that idea of a scrum

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,099
Master without it being physically

81
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,900
embodied in a person but there are lots

82
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,940
of teams out there who who don't have

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,860
that capability and there'll be lots of

84
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,860
teams in your company who don't have

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,620
that capability you are in fact unusual

86
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,420
in your ability to have all of that

87
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,799
understanding and knowledge and content

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,200
and be able to create that entity of the

89
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,180
virtual entity of the scrum Master most

90
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,060
teams really struggle

91
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,620
so the scrum Master is essential to

92
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,959
helping

93
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,159
um teams

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,260
focus on the things that improve their

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,120
effectiveness because if a team is more

96
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,580
effective everybody gets more done

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,620
everything is better other teams even

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,239
focusing on the right things right if

99
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,439
you if you are working with software

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,840
teams if you are a software team then

101
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,180
shortening that feedback loop between uh

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,739
coming up with an idea and all the

103
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,600
engineering tools you need to get it

104
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,180
into production as quickly as possible

105
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,160
is something that's going to improve

106
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,680
your effectiveness at delivering value

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,380
to the to the customer

108
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
are you there yet how do you get there

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,520
how do you even know that you need to

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,840
get there you need the scrum master that

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,780
has that knowledge has that

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,639
understanding and that knowledge and

113
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,340
understanding is critical to a team

114
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,800
being as effective as possible
