so the the the question is what is a scrum master and I think that's really interesting because I I think of a scrum Master as a guide right so so perhaps scrum guide would be a better name however that's taken by something else right but they they they're there to um they're they're somebody with with deep technical understanding of what agile is the the the the different agile practices of empiricism of lean I'll lean agile practitioner right and they're there to help guide the team so that they have the knowledge tools and skills to make the best decisions they can within the context that they're making those decisions

so it really helps if the the the the scrum master has understanding of that context right I usually think of it as there's three contexts that this scrum Master should understand there's the the business context right because they've got to help the the product owner build the right product and they've got to help the business understand why they need scrum in the first place like what does it mean to them he has to be able to speak their language

um she also needs to um really understand the technical domain of what it is the team is doing right what are they doing why are they doing it if it's this is if this is a software context then I would expect them to understand what devops is how devops functions why devops what are the different tools and practices that a team could be using to help improve the way they do things because not everybody knows right that's uh not true and the other one is organizational change context so understood standing uh beta codex understanding taylorism understanding um uh follett's work understanding how we can organize around solving particular problems so that they can have those explanations and conversations with the organization and with leaders ship and with teams and people on the ground and people high up in the clouds right we've got to have the conversations everywhere in order to have everybody understand why is it that we're moving in a particular direction

and I think all of that stuff being missing is why we're seeing a lot of uh scrum Masters being let go in organizations because they're not able to demonstrate to the organization the value that they're providing because they are absolutely essential to uh to a team in an organization's ability to deliver

it may be that you you you you work on a team and you're thinking oh but but we don't have a scrum master and we're doing great right you probably have what I would call a virtual scrum Master right you've probably got a a Gestalt of the team understanding within the body of the people doing the work of the business of the organization of change of the product of everything and you're able to create that idea of a scrum Master without it being physically embodied in a person but there are lots of teams out there who who don't have that capability and there'll be lots of teams in your company who don't have that capability you are in fact unusual in your ability to have all of that understanding and knowledge and content and be able to create that entity of the virtual entity of the scrum Master most teams really struggle

so the scrum Master is essential to helping um teams focus on the things that improve their effectiveness because if a team is more effective everybody gets more done everything is better other teams even focusing on the right things right if you if you are working with software teams if you are a software team then shortening that feedback loop between uh coming up with an idea and all the engineering tools you need to get it into production as quickly as possible is something that's going to improve your effectiveness at delivering value to the to the customer

are you there yet how do you get there how do you even know that you need to get there you need the scrum master that has that knowledge has that understanding and that knowledge and understanding is critical to a team being as effective as possible
