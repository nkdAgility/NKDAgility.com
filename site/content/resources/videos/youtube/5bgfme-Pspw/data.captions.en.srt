1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,759
momentum is is movement right you're

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,319
you're moving in a particular direction

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,319
and you have enough

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,680
stuff moving in that direction that that

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,560
it's difficult to stop right that for me

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,119
is momentum like a ship uh when a ship

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,260
puts on the brakes and it takes 10 miles

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:29,660
to stop right so so momentum especially

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,160
in product delivery is does does

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,260
everybody who's working with you

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,300
understand the direction that you're

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,399
going so that they're going in that

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,860
direction and they're going to pull

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,980
other people along with them who don't

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,500
necessarily understand as well as some

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,379
people do so if you've got enough people

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,780
moving in that direction in order to

18
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,539
pull in the rest of the people and folks

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,120
that you need and this is true for I'm

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,899
building a product or I'm changing an

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,899
organization or
