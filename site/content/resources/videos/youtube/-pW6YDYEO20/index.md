**Worst trait in unskilled scrum masters?**

Do you picture a Scrum Master as a stern taskmaster, a zealous micromanager, or even an omnipotent boss? If that's a 'yes', prepare to flip your perceptions upside down! 🔄

In the realm of Scrum Masters, there's no 'one' worst trait. 🚫 Yep, you've guessed it, the list of unsuitable characteristics can run as long as a never-ending story. 📜👀

But let's zone in on a handful of traits that stick out like a sore thumb in an unskilled Scrum Master.

I'm going to tackle some misconceptions with a pinch of humour. 😅

(Hint: If you believe Scrum Masters are a blend of taskmaster and micromanager, brace yourself! 🙅‍♂️)

Let's kick off with some of the worst traits you could find in an unskilled Scrum Master:

1️⃣          They believe they're everyone's boss

2️⃣          They constantly tell people what to do

3️⃣          They've got a PhD in micromanagement

4️⃣          They think it's their role to set up the environment

5️⃣          They're the self-proclaimed Allocators of All Work

Sounds exhausting, right?  

Indeed, this might seem overwhelming.

It's important to understand that these traits are not only counterproductive but also alien to the essence of a Scrum Master.

 In other words, these behaviours are more relevant to effective Scrum Mastery than a fish does to bicycling. This is not the path to facilitating successful, agile teams.🚀🎯

So, what does a great Scrum Master look like?

✅ They're not the boss. They're the facilitator

✅ They don't dictate. They inspire and guide

✅ They don't micromanage. They empower

✅ They don't set up the environment. They foster a conducive one

✅ They don't allocate work. They facilitate self-organization

Being a Scrum Master is about enhancing team effectiveness and Agile prowess. It's about enabling your team to stand tall, improve, and adapt. Remember, it's all about being present, adaptive, and keeping things simple.

Are you a Scrum Master who's ready to shrug off the mantle of micromanagement and embrace true facilitation? 🚀

No more dragging around baggage from the worst Scrum Master traits. 🎯
