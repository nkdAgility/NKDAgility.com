1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,440
the worst trait in unskilled scrum

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,139
Masters is probably

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,940
their thinking that they're the boss of

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,799
everybody thinking that they should be

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,960
telling people what to do thinking that

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,820
they should be micromanaging thinking

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,380
that they should be setting up the jira

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,680
environment thinking that they should be

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,080
allocating the work and all of that is

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,420
just crap has nothing to do with being a

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,199
scrum Master being a scrum Master is

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,420
about helping teams be more effective

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:37,140
and all of those things I can't think of

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,960
an easier way to make a team ineffective

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,040
focus on what helps the team stand on

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,559
their own be better at what they do

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,059
being visibly present

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,059
and yeah
