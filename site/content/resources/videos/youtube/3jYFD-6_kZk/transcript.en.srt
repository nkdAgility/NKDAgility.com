1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,120
when when you're you're migrating data

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,960
around in as your devops there are a

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,719
100,000 things that can go wrong uh

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,759
there's some really big things that

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,880
people run

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:20,119
into um if you're

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,920
using the Azure

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:26,199
devops data migration service um that

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,720
Microsoft provides to take your whole

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,880
collection up um big things are we're on

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,960
an older version of TFS that's not

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,920
supported that's one um I I did one

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,800
recently and discovered during the the

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,440
discovery that the customer still had

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,239
visual Source safe right so we had to do

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,239
a visual Source safe import first visual

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,960
Source safe I think went end of life in

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:56,359
2005 maybe 2005 so it was stuff that

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,879
been around for a long time um so we had

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,280
to bring that in first and then because

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,320
if you don't bring it in first first and

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,439
you try and upgrade your TFS first um

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,840
the vsss import is was only supported up

24
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,680
to TFS

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,759
2015 because after that it's 10 years

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,000
after vsss was end of life so Microsoft

27
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,400
stopped having that functionality in TFS

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,680
so if you don't bring it in before that

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,479
you can't bring it in not with full

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,759
history and all of the the the things

31
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:31,040
they discontinued those tools so you

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,479
that one of the most most common issues

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,119
that people run into when they're doing

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,799
migrations is doing things in the wrong

35
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,799
order um and that's over a variety of

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,560
different contexts if you push up to as

37
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,000
your devops and you've done things in

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,960
the wrong order uh you might have want

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,520
to do process template changes you want

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,119
to do them on Prem before you push them

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,119
up you might want to bring in other

42
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,640
source control stuff you need to do that

43
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,479
before you take it up um you might want

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
to move from

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,320
tfvc Team Foundation Version Control to

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,960
get you probably want to do that before

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,680
you move up but you can probably get

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,319
away with it that one you can probably

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,000
get away with um but if you the the

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:15,239
probably the biggest one this is the one

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,280
that's um there's there's absolutely no

52
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,879
way back from W I guess the vsss

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,519
stuff as well but the one that is

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,640
absolutely no way back from is is is

55
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,360
account account

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,760
alignment okay

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,519
this is this is just mental so the way

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
TFS

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,400
does

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,920
identity is TFS has an identity and it

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,879
wraps whatever the actual identity is so

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,959
in the old days this was either a workg

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
group account if you're familiar with

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
Windows authentication it's either a

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,640
work group account or it was an active

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,319
directory account right so the issue is

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,640
that if you take a work group and then

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,159
move it into a domain joint environment

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,239
and convert it to a domain joined but

70
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,920
the accounts don't match up right so TFS

71
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,519
will automatically when you move between

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,040
environments it will try and find the

73
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,480
account that matches the one that

74
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,959
already exists and just swap out the the

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,239
bit inside of the TFS identity but if it

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,959
can't find it it and it's already added

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,120
to the systems it will create a new

78
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,799
identity so you'll end up with two TFS

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,280
identities so if you've got Bob in your

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,239
company and Bob has the old TFS identity

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,400
and the new TFS identity when he logs

82
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,640
into TFS and he searches for show me all

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,080
work that's assigned to me he won't find

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,920
anything because it's assigned to Old

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,720
Bob not new Bob old identity Bob not new

86
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,799
identity Bob um and that's an order of

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,680
operations issue um and it's really hard

88
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,120
in active directory and a your active

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,439
directory because quite often there's

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,680
groups and things that that add people

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,079
into Services before you want them to be

92
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
added and then you end up with this

93
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,159
problem so as your devops kind of

94
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,000
combats that a little bit that when you

95
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,519
move stuff around because even even once

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,079
you're in is your devops you can move

97
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:18,680
from tenant a to tenant B right um so

98
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,040
you're Microsoft inra tenant identity

99
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,280
management can be swapped out and it

100
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,440
does the same thing right but it's going

101
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,120
to ask you here's a list of all the

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,440
users that we couldn't match up do you

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
want to match them up and if you click

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,840
that skip button at the bottom which if

105
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,240
you have somebody who doesn't know what

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,240
they're doing people are apt to do I I

107
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,039
find so many times things go wrong

108
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,520
because people click the skip button

109
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,400
because they think they know what it

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,800
says or they don't care what it says or

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,320
they just want to do it or it's not

112
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,320
their job or whatever reason and there

113
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,160
is no way going back to the old way

114
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,720
because now you've got those both those

115
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,960
identities exist and there's no way to

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
merge those identities so if you want

117
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,600
everything to

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,880
align uh uh uh through through your

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,960
upgrade process then all of those things

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,720
need to be taken into account probably

121
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,039
the absolute worst case of

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,680
that having to be

123
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:19,360
managed um was years ago I Microsoft

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,160
sold a part of their business to another

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,840
company so we had to get it we had to

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,560
get all of this work right the the TFS

127
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,360
environment from inside of Microsoft to

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,680
inside of this other company

129
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,360
but as you can imagine with with with

130
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,680
legal and compliance and all kinds of

131
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,160
things it wasn't that easy and when you

132
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680
work within a company you take

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
dependencies on lots of things that

134
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,800
maybe your company owns but then you

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
sell this thing and you're not selling

136
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
these things that you're taking a

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,160
dependency on so how do you how do you

138
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,280
get it out so I think we had seven I

139
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,919
think we had

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,759
seven migrations that we had to do with

141
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,479
this single environment um so there was

142
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,240
there was three

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,280
outgoing

144
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,039
one outside neither environment and then

145
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,400
three incoming into the new company and

146
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,199
at each of those levels there was

147
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,599
different validation different scripts

148
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
different things that had to be run

149
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,080
against those environments to ensure

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,759
that we don't lose anything and we don't

151
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,919
get anything we're not supposed to and

152
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,560
all of those kind of things and it was

153
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,319
absolutely horrendous nightmare of

154
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,319
convoluted legal ease right to get it to

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
get it all done um but the the biggest

156
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,000
issue was that maintaining those

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,000
identities all the way through cuz the

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,680
people were going as well and they

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,960
wanted all of the identities to match up

160
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,759
on the other side so you have to ensure

161
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,240
that you map all of the identities

162
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,960
correctly all the way through um so that

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,400
when you get to the other side people

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,479
open it up and go oh there's all my

165
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
stuff rather than oh where's all my

166
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,759
stuff gone right and then they have to

167
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,759
go find it and they have to go create

168
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,479
custom queries and all kinds of stuff to

169
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,400
to it's just a pain in the but

170
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,039
um

171
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,599
so those are some of the some of the bad

172
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,319
things that can happen identity

173
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:12,720
management that's that's there's a lot

174
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,560
of gotchas in there um database size Mo

175
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
moving up to a your devops the size of

176
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,680
the database and what's in there and how

177
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
you clean it up that's that's a bunch of

178
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,400
gotches in there if your company which

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,240
you should know developers are apt to do

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,639
um you might find that your TFS

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,160
environment has been around for a really

182
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,800
long time

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,479
and it didn't used to be run by your

184
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,400
operations team with control right it

185
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,360
maybe used to be run by the developers

186
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,159
before it was handed off to operations

187
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,560
before they knew that in the old

188
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,599
days operations often thought that

189
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
anything that developers did was

190
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,879
nonproduction

191
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,599
right even though all the code is an

192
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,479
organizational asset and we're storing

193
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,240
it in there the bill

194
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,639
environments and build agents are all

195
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,319
organizational assets because we can't

196
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,199
deliver our product if we don't have it

197
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,919
they were all considered not production

198
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,800
so developers could have the keys to

199
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,720
everything and do everything for so many

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,159
companies like that

201
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,599
um and the problem is that because they

202
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:22,280
can do whatever they want they go oh

203
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,199
there's the new beta version of TFS oh

204
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,759
it's supported by Microsoft so we'll

205
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,879
install that but it's mostly supported

206
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,479
by Microsoft right so I've had

207
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,120
environment

208
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,680
where it's a major Enterprise company

209
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,200
but in the midsts of time of that

210
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,519
environment it's had a beta version of

211
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,760
TFS deployed that was maybe supported

212
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,720
right way back in 10 years ago um but it

213
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
causes knock on errors because there

214
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,760
were a couple of things that weren't

215
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,120
taken care of that mean it can function

216
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,120
the way it is but it ain't going to is

217
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,080
your devops without fixing all of those

218
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,040
things so um there's those types of

219
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,040
things if your server is old enough

220
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
there's all sorts of buggy ass things

221
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,120
from TFS

222
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,200
2010 that they fixed in 2012 that if

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,160
you're servers old enough to have been

224
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
in 2010 and us these tfvc the team

225
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,640
Foundation version Oh there's just a

226
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,440
whole nightmare of stuff left over that

227
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,959
you have to go you have to go fix you

228
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,519
have to go fix it before you can go to

229
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,920
the go to the cloud so that's uh you can

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,200
have half committed stuff um because you

231
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,240
had to do two commits back in the to do

232
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,560
a rename but nobody told anybody and

233
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,720
there was no error

234
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,399
message so in service pack one they

235
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,959
brought in the error message and then in

236
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,360
2012 they fixed it but there's still a

237
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,440
bunch of stuff in there um that's that's

238
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,200
messed up oh so so many if you imagine a

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,120
product that's been around for 18 years

240
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,839
no not quite 18 years 16 where are we

241
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:01,560
was was created in 2005 shipped in

242
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,640
2006 man that's a long time right nearly

243
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,800
20 nearly two years off 20 18 18 years

244
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,600
right my mouth sucks 18 years of

245
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,720
engineering work has gone into this

246
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,600
product 18 years of different people

247
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,360
working on it 18 years of Forgotten

248
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,680
stuff 18 years of bodies being buried

249
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,720
underneath uh uh some of the the classes

250
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,760
and methods

251
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,959
and the stuff the stuff that doesn't

252
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,040
work the way you want it to so

253
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:35,440
those are probably where the biggest uh

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,519
difficulties are um the easy stuff the

255
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,920
stuff that can go right man i' like I

256
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,120
did mention the the migration up to

257
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Azure devops and this was really early

258
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,959
on in Azure devops that took um took

259
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,880
less than an hour I mean this this was a

260
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,480
a government agency in the UK um it was

261
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,480
a council

262
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,519
so not government government but local

263
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,040
government and we we we ran the we

264
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,320
installed the latest version of TFS um

265
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,760
everything went fine we ran the tool

266
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,440
against it it said everything was good

267
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:20,600
so the database was I think a few a a

268
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,600
couple of gig tiny so we just sequenced

269
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,760
the d pack did a dry run up into as your

270
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,920
devops that took about 15 minutes to

271
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,639
less than 15 minutes and it was there

272
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,800
they looked at the dry run they thought

273
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,959
oh this looks awesome this is perfect

274
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,320
everything's where it's supposed to be

275
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,600
we see all the stuff uh we we trust

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,079
Microsoft and throw an error if right so

277
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,560
they were just reasonable reasonable

278
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,720
folks um so we just went okay would do

279
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,200
you want to just do the production one

280
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,399
then or do you want to wait and validate

281
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
it some more and they're like no just

282
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,839
just run the production one so we run

283
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,560
the production one and we're done turn

284
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,320
off

285
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,600
TFS that's that's one headache off their

286
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,560
plate one headache off um their there

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,399
their local admins plate oh hold on we

288
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,480
need to we need to go back to what's the

289
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,720
worst the

290
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:17,560
absolute most appalling issue with TFS

291
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,880
SL Azure devops server so running it on

292
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,320
Prem especially if you're if your

293
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,760
developers are running it this will be

294
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,959
done

295
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,600
right if your operations team's running

296
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,839
it I guarantee you it's wrong and that's

297
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,839
backup

298
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,800
so most operations teams want to use

299
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,760
their standardized tools so they just

300
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,519
see a SQL server and they want to plug

301
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,680
their standard Backup Tool into Aur

302
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:51,279
devop and suck out the data store it

303
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:57,560
tape off site right if they're doing

304
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,560
that that does not guarantee a

305
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,959
restore the problem with systems like

306
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,680
TFS it's not really a problem with TFS

307
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,760
it's a problem with having people that

308
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,399
don't know what they're doing running it

309
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,240
or that don't care running it right um

310
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,320
it's actually the same issue is for

311
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,880
SharePoint and a lot of other systems

312
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,160
but you have multiple data physical

313
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,760
databases inside of the system right so

314
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,760
when it

315
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,160
runs updates you could have an update

316
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,480
that's straddles multiple databases so

317
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,320
in tf's case you've got a configuration

318
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,639
database and then you've got a bunch of

319
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,199
collection databases so you can have

320
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,839
like an identity update for example will

321
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,959
hit the collection and the configuration

322
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
database and the configuration database

323
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,680
is small so that bit will be done really

324
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,800
quickly and then it needs to complete on

325
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,199
the

326
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,240
um the other one but they run it as a

327
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,839
transaction it's absolutely possible

328
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,120
to the point in time of your

329
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,720
backup that it's completed and committed

330
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,839
on one database and not completed on the

331
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,199
other one so we'll roll back because the

332
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,160
transaction has across multiple

333
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,320
databases and this one's finished and

334
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,240
it's moving on to this one and the

335
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,279
transaction allows you to roll back the

336
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,279
whole thing but not if you restore a

337
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,639
backup without that transaction being

338
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,199
his existence right mid transaction so

339
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,399
there are things that you're supposed to

340
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,800
do that are all documented by Microsoft

341
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,440
to enable you to do marked transaction

342
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,120
logs so you actually put a mark you you

343
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,160
use the transaction system to put a mark

344
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,880
across uh uh like a bookmark across all

345
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,920
of the databases and then you back so it

346
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,519
the transaction completes all of the

347
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,560
other transactions are completed this

348
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,360
transaction completes and has this Mark

349
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,399
and it might be at different time stamps

350
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,040
across the different databases right and

351
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,040
then you back up that Mark and then when

352
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,600
you restore that Mark it's exactly the

353
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,120
right point but most people don't do

354
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,880
that and they validate things by we'll

355
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,279
do a trial restore it's totally possible

356
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,320
that that restore will work probably in

357
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,920
most circumstances that restore will

358
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,519
work but you know what Murphy says

359
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,320
what's if the worst thing could happen

360
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,440
it will happen at the worst possible

361
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,240
time right so in an actual disaster when

362
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,519
you need to recover your database that's

363
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,040
the time when you'll hit that

364
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,680
transaction log and if you hit that you

365
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,279
are not going to be able to restore your

366
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,399
databases and you're going to have to

367
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,959
call up Microsoft and they're going to

368
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,120
have to have an engineer log into your

369
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:49,959
servers and

370
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,480
run scripts to fix the databases and

371
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,680
then because they've run scripts to fix

372
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,480
the databases that's another thing that

373
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,560
can end up being a future problem when

374
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,839
you go to move to is your devops um and

375
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,519
something in the database is not quite

376
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,759
right when they do the validation and

377
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:11,480
and it fails the the import so

378
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:15,639
um my advice is never ever let an

379
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,800
operations team run TFS that's that's

380
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:22,240
that's my advice if you have to let an

381
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:27,480
operations team run TFS um ensure that

382
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,920
they must use the TFS documented backup

383
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,120
procedures not their own stuff that

384
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,040
won't work and might end up with with

385
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,839
you in the in the hole

386
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,720
um yeah so that's that's the big one 90%

387
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,000
of the time things go perfectly fine

388
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,920
right upgrading TFS super easy it used

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,440
to be an absolute nightmare but the aure

390
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,959
devops team did a bunch of work to

391
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,319
validate everything check everything and

392
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:54,480
that's part of their ethos right so if

393
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,880
you run it it will tell you here's a

394
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,600
problem here's how you fix it you fix it

395
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,639
it runs and it runs you can do the

396
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,959
upgrade

397
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,199
totally cool they're super easy but when

398
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,120
something isn't right that's when you

399
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,839
need that that

400
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,919
expertise um to go what is the problem

401
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,439
how do I fix it where does it come from

402
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,799
the documentation awesome but there's

403
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,480
still those those things that slip

404
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,959
through the cracks so that that's really

405
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,039
the things there's a lot of things that

406
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
can go wrong and a lot of things that

407
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,280
can go wrong that are really important

408
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,160
but

409
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,520
99.9% of the time everything's going to

410
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,640
be fine um you're going to be able to

411
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,559
upgrade you're going to be able to

412
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,039
migrate and everything's going to going

413
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,039
to go go great
