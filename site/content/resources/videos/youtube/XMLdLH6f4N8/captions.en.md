My name is Catherine Medics and I am a Christian. 

We did healthy. I like the foundation class that it is giving our engineering order us towards a common vision for how work will be done, which means not had before. 

It gave them hope to our developers that they can get solutions to some of the biggest problems that they're forced to deal with every day. 

I even, as a remastered, really got out of the nuances refreshers in some cases that were brand new to me, so it's definitely upped my game. 

This immediately has had a big impact on health grades. We have a common set of framework for talking about problems that we're solving, problems that we're working together. 

We were a little on the chaotic terms, of course, and it's gotten people really excited about other than risk limited feature enough energy. 

The organisational change backlog is really exciting for two reasons. One, it reduces people on the ground doing work voice code, what's holding them back. 

It's had to lose that communication channel before, and now we are building them up, marking the structured, she picked those off and to build that team back up. 

So we're not only picking out the impetus, so we're building confidence across the order set. We really do care about whistling the mapping that we want to fix. 

Two huge things have come from the creation of the backlog. One is that we have greater insights with little tighter services, meaning contagious that we now have a backlog to fix. 

The second rather unexpected to me benefit was that we have struggled with the two communication cycles. What those problems were, people have annoyed felt listened to. 

Now, without Merton, we have an unstructured system for hearing those impediments, picking them up and making things better across the board. 

Each evening is incredibly helpful and hopeful. 

I wanted Martin's compared attorney because I'd like them to the first time with books high-energy, pragmatic and really interesting. 

I'm really glad we did because even the worst skeptics in the crowd were won over.
