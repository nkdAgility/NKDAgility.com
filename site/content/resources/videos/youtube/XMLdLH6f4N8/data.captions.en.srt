00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:11,360
my name is Catherine medics and I am a

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
Christian we did healthy I

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:22,560
like the foundation class that it is

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:26,550
giving our engineering order us towards

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:30,740
a common vision for how work will be

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:34,170
done which means not had before and it

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,090
gave them hope to our developers did

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,160
they can get solutions to some of the

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,800
biggest problems that that they're

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,579
forced to

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,579
deal with every day I

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,309
even as a remastered

13
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:54,960
really got out of the nuances

14
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,840
refreshers in some cases that were brand

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,070
new to me so it's definitely up my game

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,270
of those go mister here this

17
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,360
immediately has had a big impact on

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,560
health grades we have a common set of

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,939
framework for talking about problems

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,340
that were solving problems that were

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,430
working together we were a little on the

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,229
chaotic terms of course and it's gotten

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,210
people really excited about other than

24
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,210
risk limited feature enough energy

25
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,969
the organizational change backlog is

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,170
really exciting for two reasons one

27
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:41,509
reduces people on the ground doing work

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,640
voice code what's holding them back and

29
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:47,429
it's had to lose that communication

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,520
channel before and now we are building

31
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:53,100
them of marking the structured she pick

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,479
those off and to build that team back up

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,399
so we're not only picking out the

34
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,039
impetus so we're building confidence

35
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,470
across the order set we really do care

36
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,520
about whistling the mapping that we want

37
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:09,000
to fix it two huge things have come come

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,459
the creation of the backlog one is that

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,099
we have greater insights with little

40
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,840
tighter services

41
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:18,900
meaning contagious that we now have a

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,329
backhoe to fix and we context but the

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,680
second rather unexpected to me benefit

44
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:28,799
was that we have struggled with

45
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,290
the two munication cycles what those

46
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,959
problems world people have annoyed felt

47
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,200
listened to and

48
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,680
now without Merton we have unstructured

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,630
system or hearing those impediments

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,010
picking them up and making things better

51
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,260
across the board each evening is

52
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,260
incredibly helpful and hopeful

53
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,849
I

54
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:55,439
wanted Martin's compared attorney

55
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,249
because I'd like them to the first time

56
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,650
with books high-energy

57
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:04,620
pragmatic and

58
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:06,989
really interesting and really glad we

59
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,450
did because even the worst skeptics in

60
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:18,099
the crowd were won over and that's shot

61
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:18,099
