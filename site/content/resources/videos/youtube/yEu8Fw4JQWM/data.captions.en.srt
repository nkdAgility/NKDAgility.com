1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,240
in work and progress less is more

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,799
wow there's a lot of math to unpack

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
there if you if you really want to go

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,420
into it but but ultimately the the

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,039
Mantra in kanban is is

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,220
um a different way to phrase what you

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,779
just said is stop starting work and

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,359
start finishing work

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,460
and it's the idea that the more stuff

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,320
you have on your plate the more you're

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,000
jumping between the things that you have

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,120
on your plate

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,520
um and the more time you lose to Jumping

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,579
between those things

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,700
um a great analogy that maybe only works

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,980
for the Geeks out there is paging in

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,020
Windows right you have to when you want

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,480
to do another task you have to unload

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,700
all of the information and contacts that

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,340
you've got from the previous task and

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,500
reload the next task and then continue

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,960
doing that for a period of time and then

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,180
you every time you swap you have to

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
unload and reload that's why your

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,380
computer goes mental and stops running

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
when you try and get it to do many

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,700
things because it's having to unload and

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,380
reload all the different tasks and

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,659
people are just the same our brains are

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,900
just big computers if you give people

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,700
too many different things to work on

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,500
then they they're they just get

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,580
overloaded and aren't able to to

34
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,400
function so the that matters not just

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,200
for for projects right so if you there's

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,000
a there's a book by Gerald Weinberg

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,299
systems thinking book by Joe Weinberg

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,040
that did a bunch of data and Analysis on

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,579
um context switching and the cost of

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,119
context switching and it's about 20 of

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,979
time that you lose per additional thing

42
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,600
that you have all they'll be up to I

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,180
think if they analyze one to five

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,040
projects and if you're working on five

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,320
projects at once

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,119
um you get about 20 of your time to

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,720
split between those five projects

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,840
everything else is lost for this paging

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,040
right context switch and that's just as

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,220
true

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,280
for scrum teams in sprints

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,200
when they have a bunch of random crap in

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,780
their Sprint backlog right rather than

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,760
focusing on one thing are you having a a

55
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,840
Sprint goal and having focus and moving

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,239
in One Direction if they just have uh 10

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,520
things they have to do

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
then you've got fragmentation and if

59
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,599
they start too many of those things at

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
once there's too many of those things in

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,180
progress at once they've got more whip

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,980
work in process then it starts to grind

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
to a halt because they're struggling to

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,519
switch between them struggling to get

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,720
things done

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:49,379
um so less is always more

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,360
smaller is always better in in

68
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,700
engineering work in Building Products

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,099
you want to do smaller things and you

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,560
want to have less things on the Go at

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,560
once and then things move through your

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,540
system more quickly what's a great

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,920
analogy for that I think of it like oh

74
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,080
this is a terrible analogy maybe I'll

75
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,739
maybe get shot at for this one but I I

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,220
think of it like pipes right and marbles

77
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,080
flow through pipes less effectively than

78
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,019
water flows through pipes right because

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,239
water's smaller molecules than marbles

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,000
are and if you throw a couple of rocks

81
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,700
in with those marbles big things it's

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,560
potential to clog up the pipe right it

83
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,900
might get stuck and then the marbles

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,659
have to flow around the this rock when

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,459
it gets stuck so then the amount of flow

86
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:38,400
is smaller and that's the way I think

87
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,420
about work flowing through the system of

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,640
your team

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,700
right if you've got things that are too

90
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,500
big they can more easily get stuck and

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,659
then once they get stuck everything else

92
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,860
has to flow around it and it's a

93
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,120
struggle right because you're trying to

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
get rid of this big thing while you're

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,239
doing these other things

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,000
smaller things are better right they

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,879
flow through the system better

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,340
so have smaller stuff

99
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,420
have less stuff on the go and you'll get

100
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,420
more stuff done

101
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,599
