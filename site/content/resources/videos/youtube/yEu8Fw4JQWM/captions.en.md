in work and progress less is more

wow there's a lot of math to unpack there if you if you really want to go into it but but ultimately the the Mantra in kanban is is um a different way to phrase what you just said is stop starting work and start finishing work and it's the idea that the more stuff you have on your plate the more you're jumping between the things that you have on your plate

um and the more time you lose to Jumping between those things

um a great analogy that maybe only works for the Geeks out there is paging in Windows right you have to when you want to do another task you have to unload all of the information and contacts that you've got from the previous task and reload the next task and then continue doing that for a period of time and then you every time you swap you have to unload and reload that's why your computer goes mental and stops running when you try and get it to do many things because it's having to unload and reload all the different tasks and people are just the same our brains are just big computers if you give people too many different things to work on then they're they just get overloaded and aren't able to to function so the that matters not just for for projects right so if you there's a there's a book by Gerald Weinberg systems thinking book by Joe Weinberg that did a bunch of data and Analysis on um context switching and the cost of context switching and it's about 20 of time that you lose per additional thing that you have all they'll be up to I think if they analyze one to five projects and if you're working on five projects at once

you get about 20 of your time to split between those five projects everything else is lost for this paging right context switch and that's just as true for scrum teams in sprints when they have a bunch of random crap in their Sprint backlog right rather than focusing on one thing are you having a a Sprint goal and having focus and moving in One Direction if they just have uh 10 things they have to do

then you've got fragmentation and if they start too many of those things at once there's too many of those things in progress at once they've got more whip work in process then it starts to grind to a halt because they're struggling to switch between them struggling to get things done

um so less is always more smaller is always better in in engineering work in Building Products you want to do smaller things and you want to have less things on the Go at once and then things move through your system more quickly what's a great analogy for that I think of it like oh this is a terrible analogy maybe I'll maybe get shot at for this one but I I think of it like pipes right and marbles flow through pipes less effectively than water flows through pipes right because water's smaller molecules than marbles are and if you throw a couple of rocks in with those marbles big things it's potential to clog up the pipe right it might get stuck and then the marbles have to flow around the this rock when it gets stuck so then the amount of flow is smaller and that's the way I think about work flowing through the system of your team

right if you've got things that are too big they can more easily get stuck and then once they get stuck everything else has to flow around it and it's a struggle right because you're trying to get rid of this big thing while you're doing these other things

smaller things are better right they flow through the system better

so have smaller stuff have less stuff on the go and you'll get more stuff done
