    "reasoning": "The content focuses on principles around limiting Work In Progress (WIP) in Agile and Kanban, using analogies about multitasking, context switching, and optimizing workflow for teams. At no point does the content reference or discuss human-AI collaboration, teamwork with AI agents, or emergent collective intelligence, nor does it explore any kind of human-AI partnerships. The examples and insights are purely about cognitive effects for humans or teams, systems thinking, and process efficiency—strictly within human-only contexts. The content never mentions AI, intelligent agents, or collaboration with artificial partners, and the concepts discussed, while relevant to team productivity, are not connected to the key definition or themes required for the Collective Intelligence category.",

There is no explicit mention of OKRs or their foundational ideas (objectives, key results, outcome-based measurement, strategic alignment, or stretch goals). The discussion does not align conceptually with OKRs as defined by John Doerr and omits theory, practice, or terminology specific to OKRs. The only indirect relationship is the shared value of 'focus,' but the article never references OKRs, outcome measurement, or related frameworks. The audience is generally Agile practitioners, but the content has no specific tie-in to OKRs.",

While these topics touch on workflow design and efficiency, the discussion remains rooted in general Agile and productivity principles without addressing Agentic Engineering's emphasis on maximizing human and AI agency, ethical AI integration, or decision decentralization. There are no direct mentions or deep explorations of agentic principles and no philosophical or ethical framing; the audience (Agile practitioners) and signal-to-noise ratio score high due to content focus, but depth and conceptual alignment to Agentic Engineering remain modest.",

No mention is made of autonomous agents or agentic delivery themes (such as embedding AI in delivery processes or agency, feedback loops with intelligent context, or advanced engineering practices for AI agents). The discussion is strictly on human productivity and process efficiency within conventional Agile frameworks, providing no signals that align with the definition or subtopics of Agentic Software Delivery.
