So the question is, why did so many of the early agile transformations fail? I think a better question is just, without the early part on it, right? Why do so many agile transformations fail? Because the early ones failed for the same reason as they do now. 

That's the people who are doing the implementation are not involved in the process of deciding what we're implementing. Right? That's why it fails. Because your leadership decides we're going to do it this way, and everybody else goes, "Okay, but that's the wrong way." Suddenly, they're resistive and unhappy because they feel like it's imposed upon them. 

If you know that old saying, "If I'd been asked, I would have..." right? They would have said to do something different. You get that through organisations, and it can be agile transformations, it can be digital transformations, it can be just changing something, right? 

The top-down command and control triangle model in alpha organisations, right? Where you've got the people at the top making the decisions and the people at the bottom doing the work. All the decisions are made at the top, and we steer the rest of the organisation based on those decisions. You're always going to get into that situation where the people that you need to do the stuff don't want to do it because, in this context, they're smarter than you are. 

They have more information, they have more understanding, and they perhaps have more skills in that space. So they're the ones that should be involved in driving it. I think there's been a lot of good work done by open space agile and specifically, as well, on top of that, open space beta to allow methods and systems to be created, a practice to be created that allows you to involve everybody in the organisation in making those decisions. 

If you involve everybody in the organisation in making those decisions, then even though it might not be the decision that they would have made if they were sitting there on their own, right? Because they were involved in making that decision, they feel like their voice is heard. If they feel like their voice is heard, they're more likely to get behind whatever the ultimate decision was because it's a collective decision, right? 

Decentralisation and democratisation of the ideas, and then they'll be supporting and helping with the transition as you move forward rather than getting in the way and hindering because they just don't care, because you didn't ask me anyway. 

That's what I think is why agile transformations fail, and I think it's just as true today as it was in the early days. It's just in the early days, there was a small number of high-profile agile transformations, and today, there are hundreds of thousands of actual transformations going on.
