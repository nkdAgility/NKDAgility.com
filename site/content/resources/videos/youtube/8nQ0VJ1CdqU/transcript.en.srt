1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,540
so the question is why did so many of

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,880
the early agile Transformations fail

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,820
and I think a better question is just

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,279
without the early part on it right why

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,140
why do so many agile Transformations

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,580
fail because the early ones failed for

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,680
the same reason as as as as they do now

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,000
and

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,280
that's the the people who are doing the

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,440
implementation

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,760
are not involved in the process of

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,760
deciding what we're implementing

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,840
right that that that's why that's why

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,719
that's why it fails because your your

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,860
leadership decides we're going to do it

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,140
this way

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,420
and everybody else goes okay but that's

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,059
the wrong way and suddenly they're

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,219
resistive and unhappy because they feel

20
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,800
like it's imposed upon them

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,979
um if you know that that old if I'd been

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,920
asked I would have right said to do

23
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,439
something different and you get that

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,740
through through organizations and it can

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,820
be agile Transformations it can be

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,280
digital Transformations it can be

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,280
um just we're changing something right

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,439
the the the the the

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,619
in that

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,320
top down command and control

31
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,259
triangle model

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,299
Alpha organizations right where where

33
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,619
you've you've got the people at the top

34
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,640
are the ones making the decisions and

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,920
the people at the bottom are the ones

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
doing the work and all the decisions are

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,759
made at the top and we steer the rest of

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,100
the organization based on those

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,619
decisions you're always going to get

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,920
into that situation where

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,820
um the the the people that you need to

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,380
do the stuff don't want to do it because

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,100
in this context they're smarter than you

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,899
are

45
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,240
they have more information they have

46
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,460
more understanding and they perhaps have

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,140
more skills in that space so they're the

48
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,160
ones that should be involved in driving

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,319
it so I I I I I think there's been a lot

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,720
of good work done

51
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,620
um by by

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,920
um uh open space agile

53
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:27,000
um and specifically as well on top built

54
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,120
on top of that open space beta to allow

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,120
um

56
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:37,260
methods systems are we a a mechanism to

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,080
be created a practice to be created that

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,519
allows you to involve everybody in the

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
organization and making those decisions

60
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,819
if you involve everybody in the

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
organization and making those decisions

62
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,840
then even though

63
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,860
it might not be the decision that they

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
would have made if they were sitting

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,879
there on their own right because they

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,500
were involved in making that decision

67
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,819
they feel like their voice is heard and

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,620
if they feel like their voice is heard

69
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,019
they're more likely to get behind

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,840
whatever the ultimate decision was

71
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,239
because it's a collective decision right

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,160
decentralization and democratization of

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,739
the the the ideas

74
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,540
and then they'll be supporting and

75
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,300
helping with the transition As you move

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,680
forward rather than getting in the way

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,680
and hindering because they just don't

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,680
care because you didn't ask me anyway

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,260
um that's what I think is is is why

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,540
agile Transformations fail

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,540
and I think it's just as true today as

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,700
it was in the the early days it's just

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,099
in the early days there was a small

84
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,200
number of high profile agile

85
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,260
Transformations and and today there's

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,299
there's there's hundreds of thousands of

87
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,299
actual Transformations going on
