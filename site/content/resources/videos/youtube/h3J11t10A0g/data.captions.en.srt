1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:04,319
most

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,880
organizations that I

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:11,840
encounter really suffer

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,200
from Miss deadlines and budget overruns

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,720
for their software projects it's

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:20,760
probably the most common issue uh that I

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,000
see happening happening in organizations

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,960
and it can be really unpredictable you

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,840
can you can think that you've got this

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,560
one in the bag but it just the bag melts

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,200
and it starts dropping out the bottom

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,879
all over the all over the street this is

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,680
something that is a fundamental

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,960
reality of the world of complexity right

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,239
that the the what we we know is less

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,960
than what we don't know therefore we

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
have a high degree of

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:58,600
unpredictability and the

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:02,399
things the the what we we use to

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,640
mitigate that is effectively technical

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,600
leadership and Engineering Excellence

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,040
right we we we need our

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,640
Engineers to be building products that

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,119
are of a high enough quality that we can

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,119
pivot as needed at any moment and we

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,280
need our leadership within our

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
organization who have a controlling

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,280
interest in in the product right the

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,200
delivery to have enough of an

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,040
understanding of the technical technical

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,520
realities not just of doing the work but

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,560
of ideation and and futurism right what

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
are the possibilities for for this

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,600
product to be able to enable better

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,439
decisions to be made within the context

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
of the

37
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,560
product this and this is this is super

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,560
hard because we like to think that

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,439
there's one right way to do something

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,520
there's a best practice that's a fallacy

41
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,680
we like to think that all of we've hired

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,479
these awesome Engineers they just know

43
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,520
how to solve the problem and that can

44
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:12,800
quite often be a fallacy as well

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:15,040
so we we need tools and capabilities

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
around that to help us be be more

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,959
effective

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,680
so the the principles and philosophies

49
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,400
behind agile and

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,440
scrum those ideas of iterative

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,599
development of continuous delivery

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,080
continuous feedback continuous testing

53
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,160
pretty much anything with continuous in

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,440
front of it in in in the modern modern

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,840
software engineering space are those

56
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:44,319
things that will enable us to be more

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,040
effective to make better decisions to

58
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,800
encourage technical leadership and to

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,800
encourage engineering excellence
