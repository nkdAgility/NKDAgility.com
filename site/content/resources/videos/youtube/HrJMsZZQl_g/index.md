# When is an APS course appropriate for a scrum team?

In this video, Martin discusses the significance of the APS (Applying Professional Scrum) course for Scrum teams. ðŸ“šðŸš€ The APS course stands out in Scrum training as it educates Scrum teams on how to adopt and implement Scrum professionally. Especially when conducted privately, it provides insights tailored to an organisation's specific context.

Organisations today are in a constant state of flux, trying to adapt to the ever-evolving market dynamics. Recognising these shifts, many are turning to Scrum to streamline their processes. The APS course emerges as a beacon, guiding teams on how to seamlessly integrate Scrum into their operations. But it's not just about learning the ropes; it's about understanding the essence of Scrum and moulding it to fit an organisation's unique needs. The course doesn't offer a one-size-fits-all solution but rather equips teams with the tools to carve out their path in the Scrum journey.
