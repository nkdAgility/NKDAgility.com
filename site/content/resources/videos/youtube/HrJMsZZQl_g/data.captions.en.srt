1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:13,160
an APS class is appropriate for um a

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,080
scrum team if they are in fact a scrum

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,720
team right that's that's in my book if

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,039
you're a scrum team uh then the aps

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,640
class is a great way to both get started

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,039
get H scraped those Barnacles off right

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,880
off your ship but also um I think

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,079
there's a difference between the

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,960
traditional APS class um all the way

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,960
through to the immersive APS class so if

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,680
you think about the the traditional APS

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,879
class is usually two full days or four

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,640
consecutive half days that's usually the

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,079
traditional traditional format um and

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,800
that's really appropriate when man we

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,680
just we we as we just don't have time as

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,399
an organization to really invest in our

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,320
our our our change and we need we just

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,879
need a like like quick punch right a

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,200
quick one two let's get started let's

21
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,600
get going let's solve a couple of those

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,320
couple of those problems you're probably

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,520
not going to solve a lot of the problems

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,479
right you you'll from the class the

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,159
people that are attending will pick

26
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,040
particular things that they're like

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,000
that's the thing I really just really

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
annoys me and and they'll help you fix

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,799
that and it'll probably be only a couple

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,680
of things but that's still valuable

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,240
right super valuable in in organizations

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,079
that are getting started the immersive

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,920
class is more the Lo the longer term the

34
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:39,840
longer term investment in in change for

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,320
for your team and your organization um

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,200
it enables you to have continuous a

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,280
continuously adaptive learning process

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,200
so that you can close those feedback

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,520
loops um have that double Loop learning

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,000
right so that you can you can get

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,320
feedback on the things that you tried um

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,960
and if you're doing it as an APS your

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,799
whole team can get feedback rather than

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,119
it being an individual assignment uh

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,719
which a lot of the other immersive

46
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,960
classes have if you're doing it as a

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,200
private class inside of your

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,680
organization it's more like it's a team

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,560
assignment what is your team going to

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,360
try this week to help them be more

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,200
effective what are they going to try

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,319
next week to be more effective all come

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,360
back together let's have a retrospective

54
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,200
right a debrief

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,959
on we tried this did it work out could

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,840
we have done better is there stuff we

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,920
want to keep stuff we want to stop doing

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,959
right and you can then continuously over

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,080
10 weeks improve the capability of your

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,000
team Identify some of the impediments in

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,440
your organization as you go through and

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
perhaps you can fix them during the

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,680
class getting feedback uh from the

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
trainer um the trainer providing some

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,800
you know Consulting for your

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,879
organization to help them uh deal with

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,800
some of those issues um that that's

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,599
really the aps class is appropriate for

69
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,040
any team um if you want a hard one

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,360
two let's get some stuff sorted get some

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,159
crap out of my team's way uh the

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
probably the two-day APS class in a

73
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,319
private company is is the one to go to

74
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,319
but if you really want uh uh to solve as

75
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,239
many problems as you possibly can within

76
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,440
your organization have as much learning

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,879
as you possibly can within your

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,439
organization and close as many of those

79
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,720
feedback loops right have it in as

80
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,439
empirical a process as you can um then I

81
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,640
would definitely definitely suggest the

82
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,400
immersive

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,319
