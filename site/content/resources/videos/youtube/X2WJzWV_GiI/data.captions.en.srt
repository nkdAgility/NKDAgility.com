this

12
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
i am going to i'm going to get started

13
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,639
i'm pretty sure

14
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,360
that that more people will drop in i i

15
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
have found that in this live virtual

16
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,120
world

17
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,320
um many people forget about meetings

18
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,040
that's one thing

19
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
um and they realize late like when they

20
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
get that little pop-up on

21
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,240
teams or whatever that the meeting has

22
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
started um

23
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
and i'm sure i'll be forever clicking

24
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,600
the approve the lobby button

25
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,280
um that i have i should probably

26
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
actually turn the lobby off i thought it

27
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
would be a good idea

28
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
um but as it turns out it's just more

29
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,199
work

30
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:10,240
yeah there's another lobby admit george

31
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,560
there we go so let me save that

32
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,919
so now everybody should bypass the lobby

33
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,120
if it goes all the way through

34
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,080
so um i am going to stick

35
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
uh the link to the mural in the chat and

36
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,080
i'll need to keep

37
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
posting it in the chat just because um

38
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,720
things things go missing in um

39
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,120
these chat programs when it's uh live

40
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,520
virtual so let me

41
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
so there is a there is a pin i think

42
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,479
there is a pin message feature

43
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,199
but the pin message so that was shelton

44
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,960
was asking

45
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,840
is there not a pin message feature there

46
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,720
is um but

47
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,560
not if we're in our

48
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,720
um webcast because

49
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,240
i think you guys lose access to the

50
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,840
webcast when

51
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
uh we we we leave um but i'll have all

52
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,520
of the

53
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,080
the the materials and stuff uh for you

54
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:18,400
later so um if everybody could join

55
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,199
the mural i am not going to be sharing

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
my screen um it's going to be all done

57
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
through

58
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,199
through mural that's how i teach my

59
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
classes as well

60
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
uh so next week i'm what am i teaching

61
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,479
next week i have

62
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,080
uh applying professional scrum with

63
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
software delivery

64
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,680
for a private customer over in the u.s

65
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,080
and then i have a a public

66
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,440
uh um psm2

67
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,120
in nigeria um so it's in a nigerian time

68
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,160
zone so that's i think that's an hour

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
ahead of me

70
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,599
in the uk no it's exactly the same as me

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,160
in the uk this is the

72
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:59,520
the downside of international stuff

73
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,960
is i wonder how many time zones

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,720
um we have in the room just now yeah

75
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479

77
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,440

uh some folks from europe uh there's

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,440
probably some folks from further

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,440
further afield uh depending on how the

82
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,039
time zone fits for people so it's it's

83
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,880
8 00 a.m in pacific time

84
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,720

festival

119
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
my spanish sucks though it's terrible

been

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
in in a in a session with me before um

137
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
my name

138
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,920
is uh martin hinchowitz i'm a

139
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
professional scrum trainer with

140
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,200
scrum.org

141
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,320
um we are going to be uh

142
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
i just want to do a little an

143
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,480
introduction to agility right that's

144
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,320
that's really what i want to focus on

145
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
um if you've been in one of my classes

146
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
you might recognize some of the ideas

147
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,160
the way i talk

148
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,640
at what it is i'm going to talk about um

149
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
and i really want to to to demonstrate

150
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,279
two things because there's two groups of

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
people that are going to come to this

152
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,240
there's people who are just interested

153
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
in an introduction to agility and don't

154
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
care about the rest of the stuff

155
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
right and then those people that are

156
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,839
interested in more of the meta

157
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,839
conversation

158
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,839
how do i run a meeting

159
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
online how do i what are the tools and

160
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,000
techniques

161
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
that i could use to make those meetings

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
more effective

163
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,640
now i learned a lot from my

164
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,760
two favorite people um barry and

165
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
uh and christian over in the netherlands

166
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
um and they use a lot of liberating

167
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,279
structures in their sessions so i'm

168
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,720
going to be using some some liberating

169
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,160
structures as well

170
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
and hopefully that will give you the

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,440
idea if you obviously if you know the

172
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
content

173
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
you totally understand all the things

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,240
that i'm talking about um

175
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,920
it's an opportunity to help coach

176
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,480
at those in your groups who do not right

177
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,279
um

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,160
that's always a a good experience and

179
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,760
and why

180
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,040
often um i find i i have i had

181
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,680
two people last year who are long-term

182
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
uh trainers and consultants and agility

183
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
come

184
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
into one of my classes just to have the

185
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,880
experience of working with a bunch of

186
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
other people

187
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,040
talking about some of these ideas and

188
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,079
getting some practice because we only

189
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,959
need a little bit of practice

190
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,839
so i am just making sure that is good

191
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,120
this is good

192
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,760
cool so what what i'm going to do is i

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
have

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
and i can see that i missed a question

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,920
there so i'm going to have to try and

196
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,000
think of one

197
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,160
i've got an empty box number six is

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,399
empty um i got distracted

199
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,519
because somebody joined the call early

200
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,399
um

201
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
so let's see right all of these little

202
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,200
red

203
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,440
crosses and green ticks um are

204
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
free right there they're available for

205
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,639
you to move around in the mural i'll

206
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
summon everybody so that you're all

207
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
looking at the same thing as me there we

208
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,880
go there's 14 people

209
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
in the mural um there are a bunch of

210
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
statements

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,279
in these hexagons uh there are a

212
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,639
nine statements because i missed six it

213
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,440
just has a question mark

214
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
and i'd like you to read that statement

215
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,399
to yourself

216
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,040
and then um drag over either a tick

217
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
or a cross depending on whether you

218
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,880
believe

219
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,880
that statement to be true or false okay

220
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,160
shouldn't it be like true would be a

221
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,839
checkbox

222
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,839
because you got true with the x's and

223
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,600
falses

224
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,240
you you are

225
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,440
see i wanted to make sure that you were

226
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
paying attention

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,000
oh okay

228
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,079
you get you get a gold star um

229
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,760
so i'll just swap them around but i

230
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,240
think you get the idea i probably could

231
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,839
have done

232
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,839
it even without swapping them around but

233
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
you get the idea uh put an x

234
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,279
if you dis if you think the statement is

235
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,760
false

236
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
um and put a tick if you think the

237
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,560
statement is true

238
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
in the box just drag one over um

239
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,560
they should all go on top they shouldn't

240
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,639
drop behind i think i fixed that

241
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
i can see a few people are having fun

242
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,079
with the drawing tools on mural

243
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,200
if you do accidentally and click the

244
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,399
pen on the far left and end up stuck in

245
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
drawing mode

246
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,079
at the top of the screen there's a

247
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,200
little drop down appears with a

248
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,399
end um

249
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,959
end drawing on there i'm just posting

250
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
the

251
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,800
mural again for those that came in a

252
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,760
little bit

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,680
later so we have 20 people that's good

254
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
i'm happy with uh

255
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,680
with 20 people i was saying earlier 80

256
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
people signed up and i was kind of not

257
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,480
looking

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,160
forward to trying to manage breakout

259
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,279
rooms with 80 people

260
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:03,839
um so that's good oh this is this

261
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:03,839
this is an interesting group

262
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,000
i think all the all the all the

263
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,000
super knowledgeable people turned up

264
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,399
today

265
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,040
cool so let's see

266
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,040
let me have a have a look uh

267
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,240
we like that we like that we like that

268
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
okay so we've got three contentious ones

269
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
there

270
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,600
three five and seven okay so it's only

271
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
three five and seven that are

272
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
contentious

273
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,880
maybe two a little bit right but it's

274
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,839
not not i don't have to worry about this

275
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,199
there's

276
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,320
one person and that thinks that is

277
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,399
false and for that one person if

278
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,399
if we don't discuss the thing you want

279
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,519
to discuss here which is why you put

280
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,279
an x there please feel free to

281
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,160
to ping me offline um but that might be

282
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
there might be an interesting

283
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,839
conversation there

284
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:13,040
okay looks like we have quite a few

285
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
ticks some people are still um pushing

286
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,720
things around

287
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
let me check the chat awesome so we've

288
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,440
probably

289
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:27,839
uh got enough people for for for now

290
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,839
hey john say guns

291
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,279
okay so let's let's have a look at um

292
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,680
some of the ones that are contentious so

293
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,880
three seems to be very contentious there

294
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,360
are products

295
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,399
that should be developed with

296
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,600
traditional

297
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,600
plan driven practices and i very

298
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,839
specifically used the word

299
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,959
developed there as opposed to number 10

300
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,040
which is exactly the same statement but

301
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,720
with the word delivered

302
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,680
in it if we are delivering products that

303
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,240
already exist

304
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,480
right maybe we just need a plan and work

305
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,079
the plan

306
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,839
i think we're we're going to get to some

307
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,839
of those ideas and

308
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
if we're building products that don't

309
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,440
exist yet

310
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,480
think of the complexity of doing

311
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,519
something that's never been done before

312
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,759
right what's the level of variance

313
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,839
between how long you expect something to

314
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
take and how long it actually takes when

315
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
you've

316
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,399
never done it before

317
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,120
so i like to think of product delivery

318
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,199
as a production line right that's that's

319
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,680
the the the quintessential

320
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,040
delivery there's a production line uh

321
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,959
the the car plant

322
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
in germany volkswagen's car plant in

323
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,959
germany has

324
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
one suv drops off the production line

325
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,839
every 60 seconds

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,320
right there's very low variance in that

327
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,720
story they're always

328
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
optimizing it right they're inspecting

329
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
and adapting but there's low variance so

330
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
they can have a plan and they can work

331
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,439
it

332
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
whereas if they they were building

333
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
unique

334
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
cars every time so they had to retool

335
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,160
the plant

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,120
they had to redo everything every time

337
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,839
they built a car

338
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,400
you're basically hand making all of the

339
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,600
cars

340
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,160
that's a lot more complex

341
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,880
right so that's that's uh i'm so i'm

342
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
going to

343
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,679
um bring up a tick and i'm going to make

344
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,799
it a little bit bigger just so you know

345
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,080
it was me

346
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,440
that put it there okay um

347
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,840
and well i'm gonna put the big tick down

348
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,960
there

349
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,320
and a little cross on the three i i do

350
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,080
not think

351
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
and i'm happy if people disagree with me

352
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,600
we're gonna get into the details

353
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,840
that there are products that should be

354
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,240
developed developed using traditional

355
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,280
plan driven practices

356
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,120
that keyword is developed

357
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
right it depends how much time you spend

358
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
in development as well but

359
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,240
we're definitely gonna gonna hit on that

360
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,600
again it just this gives me an idea

361
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,960
of where everybody is um

362
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,200
the other one that's content i think

363
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
number five was contentious

364
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,240
uh but then a few people changed their

365
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
mind right

366
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,840
maybe they decided to go with the flow

367
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
what everybody else was putting or maybe

368
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,640
they just read it wrong that's okay

369
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,520
my my english sucks as george knows

370
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
he's been in a class with me um being

371
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
scottish

372
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,480
uh bad english is my first language um

373
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
so please

374
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
please feel free to correct me if i'm

375
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,440
not making any sense

376
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,400
that is definitely something to do um

377
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,720
so the bottom look at number seven it's

378
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,200
is

379
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,559
it okay to ship products to production

380
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,919
every three months

381
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,000
lots of no's but also a few yeses

382
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,400
right that that's that's an interesting

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,280
conversation

384
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,240
right how how long can we go

385
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,400
building the wrong thing before we get

386
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
into production get it in front of users

387
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,039
and find out

388
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,720
that we're building the wrong thing

389
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,720
what's our time to failure

390
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,000
right there's a lot how much how much

391
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:15,280
money could you spend

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,280
in three months on an engineering team

393
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
right depends where you are in the world

394
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,240
what that what that number

395
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,559
is but i guarantee you that number is

396
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
proportionally relevant to your budget

397
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,360
right wherever you are in the world

398
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,640
wherever you're running these projects

399
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,840
so we want to find out that we're

400
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
building the wrong thing as quickly as

401
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,320
possible

402
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,919
and unfortunately we we use techniques

403
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
in the plan driven world like unit

404
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
testing

405
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,480
not unit testing that's my brain dying

406
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,240
of

407
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,320
uh uat user acceptance testing

408
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,600
and user accept has anybody ever done

409
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
user acceptance testing

410
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,880
like have you ever been given a product

411
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,240
or opened a

412
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
tried to play around with a product

413
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
that's in beta but you're not actually

414
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,240
going to use

415
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,159
yeah shelton has and do you do what i do

416
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,720
you open up you click around you're like

417
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,559
that looks okay and go somewhere else

418
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
right i go back to my day job because

419
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,360
that's what i do when i have to test

420
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,280
a thing that i'm not actually using

421
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,600
which is why i like to test in

422
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,640
production

423
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,159
right i like to make sure that

424
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,640
the product is going to work the way i

425
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,559
work

426
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,600
when i'm doing my job and the only place

427
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,679
that is true

428
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,120
is when you can use it for real not for

429
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,640
pretend

430
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,720
and uat is pretend

431
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
so we have to get into production as

432
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,600
quickly as possible

433
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,360
to validate our hypothesis that this is

434
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
a useful feature

435
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,440
that's that's why that that question is

436
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,960
in there so i i would say it's

437
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,960
it's it's not okay

438
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,720
to ship to production only every three

439
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,120
months that's

440
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,240
too long too expensive too much waste

441
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,640
right but there might be industries

442
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,360
where that makes sense

443
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,960
okay so what what what is it uh let me

444
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,400
remember when i say rules are for the

445
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,799
guidance of wise people and the

446
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,880
obedience of fools

447
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
right and there are always going to be

448
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
exceptions

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
and all we can really worry about is the

450
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,600
the the common cause

451
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,360
ah shelton's brought up um an elephant

452
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,240
in the room i like this one shelton

453
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,640
thank you

454
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,120
um so he brought up this idea that the

455
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,440
internal it projects often has very

456
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,480
extensive uat

457
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,520
because they know it will run ruin their

458
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,640
life i think you mean

459
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,440
ruin their life when it goes live yes

460
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
because our quality sucks we're

461
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
delivering

462
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,360
crap products to production so then the

463
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,679
the the reaction that the people were

464
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,360
delivering those crap products to

465
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:05,360
has is they want to protect themselves

466
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:09,120
so they have uat change control boards

467
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,440
uh what else could you put in the way

468
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,880
of of of getting stuff into production

469
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,559
because you know

470
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
that the the developers output quality

471
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,600
is

472
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,480
not good enough to support your product

473
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,159
at pat

474
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,640
i'm not sure what pat p-a-t s-i-t's

475
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,360
site yeah yeah yeah yeah production yeah

476
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
all

477
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
there's loads of things that you can put

478
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,159
in the in the way to

479
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,000
to make things more difficult to get

480
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,360
into production and and

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,760
we do when those things happen

482
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
i always look to the quality of the

483
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,919
output

484
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,679
what is it we're delivering and is it of

485
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,679
an acceptable level of quality

486
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,360
right because if it's not acceptable

487
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,400
people are going to put blocks in the

488
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,440
way of us getting it into production

489
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
um so i don't see anything else there

490
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,840
that's

491
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,000
super contentious does anybody want to

492
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,480
raise anything

493
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
that they think is that they wanna that

494
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,840
they're that one red x and they

495
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
think they're right that's cool too

496
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,200
i am not always

497
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,679
uh i'm pretty

498
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
usually pretty open to to to questions

499
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,880
there's there are really no silly

500
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,480
questions

501
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,520
okay okay

502
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,720
cool so um

503
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,039
nuclear nuclear electricity no yeah

504
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,000
that's that's a good one um but if

505
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,840
quality is high

506
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
enough you could continuously deliver to

507
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
production

508
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,360
right the the the the team that runs

509
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,200
azure

510
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
deploys to production many times a day

511
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,640
so the whole of azure their management

512
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,000
software that runs azure

513
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,600
is deployed many times per day that

514
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,679
seems like it would pro probably um

515
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,880
have to have good quality high quality

516
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,039
code good tests

517
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,520
then we can look we can be sure of our

518
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,720
quality

519
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,960
uh okay so let's let's go on to the the

520
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,960
the the next exercise that was really

521
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,080
the the the ice breaker

522
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,159
and we want we want to talk about teams

523
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,200
right i did promise um a little bit

524
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
about what what the

525
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,440
what the great teams look like but i'm

526
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,919
kinda i'm gonna surf it

527
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
i'm gonna surf it from from from you

528
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,840
right because

529
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:37,120
i bet you've all worked with

530
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
teams in the past um you've worked on

531
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,320
teams

532
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,520
uh you've maybe envied somebody else's

533
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,799
team you've seen

534
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,159
sports teams right they generally have

535
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,200
to work together

536
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,440
to get to their goal okay

537
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,799
um so i want to do at this exercise let

538
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,320
me check the number of people again i

539
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,600
think it was about 20

540
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,039
29 okay so um

541
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,720
oh let's let's let's see this is the

542
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,799
largest group

543
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,159
i have done a liberating structure

544
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,720
called one two four

545
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,360
all with okay uh this is a technique

546
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,960
uh that i use and you can use as well in

547
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,600
any of your meetings when you want to

548
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,520
generate

549
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,000
a list of ideas right anytime you ask a

550
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,360
quest

551
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,120
you know how have you ever been um i i'm

552
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,840
not sure how to say your name is a

553
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
loud dress

554
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,330
[Laughter]

555
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,279
if you're in a meeting and you ask

556
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,679
at 20 people a question um

557
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,880
how often do you get more than one or

558
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
two people replying

559
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,600
probably one one yeah it's pretty rare

560
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,440
yeah it's pretty rare so so but that

561
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,159
meeting's expensive because there's 20

562
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,159
people there

563
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,880
so why are we not able to surf their

564
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,279
opinions as well

565
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
so the idea behind one two four all is

566
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,480
to get people

567
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
um collaborating and engaged in the

568
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
topic

569
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,960
so what we're going to do this is the

570
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,840
the rough flow there are four

571
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,279
four rounds there uh i will i will

572
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
summon so everybody's looking at the

573
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,320
same

574
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,600
exercise there's 18 people in the mural

575
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,960
but 29 people

576
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,480
in the in the chat you will not be able

577
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,520
to see what we're talking about

578
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,279
unless you are also in the mural

579
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,679
at least i think that's how many is in

580
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,640
the mural so i've pasted the mural

581
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,159
into the chat again um you should be

582
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
able to join just by

583
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,279
clicking in it's not a big mural so it

584
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,279
should run fairly well

585
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,799
uh so there are four rounds the first

586
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,720
round is for

587
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,840
everybody to silently and on their own

588
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,880
write down a list of behaviors that you

589
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,919
have seen in great

590
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,960
teams so i'll give you a minute for that

591
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,039
and then what i'm going to do is i'm

592
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,880
going to create breakout rooms

593
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,559
so hopefully everybody that's here is

594
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,279
paying attention or you might end up

595
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,080
in a room on your own for two minutes

596
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,520
yeah

597
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,559
all right so go into room for two

598
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,760
minutes and you take your two lists

599
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,360
from your two people that are in the

600
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,159
breakout room and join them together

601
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,000
merge those ideas together dedupe it

602
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,840
right so you have one list and then come

603
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,960
up with some more ideas by

604
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,440
uh rubbing our brains together and then

605
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,520
after

606
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,200
two minutes this is the bit that might

607
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,279
not work from my side

608
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,679
is i'm going to merge

609
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,159
the breakout rooms so that you're in

610
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,200
rooms of four

611
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,960
okay so that'll be groups of four

612
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,559
and and then you'll get four minutes in

613
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,200
groups of four to do the same thing

614
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,480
because you'll have

615
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,679
two lists again room one and room two

616
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,960
we'll have two lists

617
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,799
bring them together you'll end up with

618
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,120
one list and then we'll bring it back to

619
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,840
the

620
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,120
to the rest of the room does does the

621
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,159
explanation make sense for everybody

622
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,000
cool i can only um use the

623
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
visual of the people that are on on

624
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,200
camera to know

625
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,760
that um things are things are

626
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,120
going good um so if you're not on camera

627
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,039
and you don't know you'll need to

628
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,799
you'll need to go off mute and shout out

629
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,080
as well um because i can only see

630
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,960
everybody else nodding so i'm going to

631
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,399
put a timer on for one minute

632
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,720
right there'll be a little airplane

633
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,120
noise at the end i know we all miss

634
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,880
that that um take your seatbelt off

635
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,960
noise from the airlines so

636
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,080
um that will be the the indication that

637
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
the minute is over

638
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,640
and i'd like you to on your own in front

639
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,679
of you write down a list

640
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,679
of behaviors that you've seen in great

641
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
teams

642
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
you don't need to put you don't need to

643
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,159
put this list on the

644
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,919
mural yet um once you get into

645
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,159
pairs that's a good idea but if that's

646
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,080
where you want to put stuff that's cool

647
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,440
um i have a little hint so i'm going to

648
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,120
open the brevis a minute

649
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,960
i'm going to open the breakout rooms but

650
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,159
just before you do i'm going to give you

651
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,000
a little hint

652
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,799
if you made that list on your computer

653
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,279
as a bullet list or just a new line per

654
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,039
list

655
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,640
you will be able to copy and paste it

656
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,320
into mural and it will create a little

657
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,440
post-it for each

658
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,120
of the the the items so let me just

659
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,320
check the breakout rooms because we had

660
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,080
exactly

661
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,520
an even number of people and then

662
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,720
somebody else joined

663
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,279
uh so they will be stuck with me uh for

664
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,120
the

665
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,320
for the for the breakout room so i'm

666
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,919
going to click open

667
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,880
and you'll get a little notification on

668
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,960
your screen that the breakout rooms are

669
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,960
opening it'll take about 10 seconds

670
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
before you start moving off into your

671
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,279
breakout rooms

672
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,240
so i'd like you to in the pair that

673
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,919
you're in

674
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,840
and get your list onto the mural merge

675
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,120
with the other person so you've got one

676
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,120
list um

677
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,320
yep everybody's disappearing

678
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,519
hey most people are off into their

679
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,080
breakout rooms

680
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,600
um i can create a new room

681
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,600
a couple of the rooms have not finished

682
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,799
opening yet so i can see that now you're

683
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,799
still here and

684
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:21,840
there's a couple of folks um

685
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:33,840
oh and there's a room that's empty

686
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:33,840
let me put um

687
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,799
hey

688
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,679
okay so i am wondering what happened

689
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,600
to mal you should have a little pop-up

690
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,919
for your

691
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,919
to join the room if not

692
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,880
do you have a little pop-up do you have

693
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,880
a little uh

694
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,919
ah tell you what we'll just hang out

695
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,360

things on to i can see there's some

700
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,080
uh crazy stuff happening on on mural

701
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,200

709
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,919
what makes a great team when we had a

710
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,919
little list

711
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
one of the things that the the five

712
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
things that i

713
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,480
that i mentioned was that i continued my

714
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,519
improvement psychological safety

715
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,919
technological excellence there is

716
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:17,039
self-organization and a small team

717
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,000
small team cool yeah yeah that's a

718
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,559
pretty nice place

719
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,880
i was thinking about courage respect

720
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,919
among each other

721
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,600
those kind of things mostly

722
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:39,840
technical parties that's good um

723
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:39,840
people aspect i was thinking about more

724
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,600
i am going to merge the rooms for the

725
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,760
people that

726
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,880
it's uh merged really badly but let's

727
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,880
see if it will work

728
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,159
i'm going to move 14 people i think

729
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:21,839
that's pretty close to

730
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:21,839
good let's see what happens

731
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:35,839
right so

732
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,679
so 13 ah somebody's disappeared

733
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:50,480
so let's just close that room then

734
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,520
and let's close that one

735
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,520
because they're not in it

736
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,839
there we go so i think we have groups of

737
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,839
four now

738
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,839
mostly

739
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,880
oh alex is stuck on his own so i'm going

740
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,760
to close that room there we go

741
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
so if you're like hi coach daniel if you

for um great

746
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,280

747
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,839
teams uh

748
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,839

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,079
ah that's a bit weird okay

753
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
hmm

754
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,720
all right so does anybody have any

755
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,760
additional things

756
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,760
that they would like to

757
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,280
two three four five six seven eight nine

758
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,960
people failed to move i am gonna have to

759
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,960
talk to the team's team about this

760
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,400
okay i i i've got a little separate

761
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,440
recording so that i can see

762
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,920
so they can see what happened um

763
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,839
because yeah it's a it's a quite a big

764
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:41,839
problem just helping somebody out by

765
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,839
converting their big list into uh

766
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:53,040
ideas absolutely no wrong ideas

767
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,839
giving everyone space collaboration what

768
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,839
else should be on there

769
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,720
there's about just about two minutes

770
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,720
left

771
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,800
i guess that's represented oh that's

772
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:12,079
uh good can you see the mural

773
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,079
are you able to see the mural

774
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,200
there should be a link in the chat i put

775
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,400
it on the linkedin page

776
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,400
as well um

777
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,800
but only for people that signed up for

778
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,119
the linkedin

779
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,119
channel

780
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
i can see how many people are in the

781
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,800
mural there are 24 people in the mural

782
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,760
that's pretty close to the number of

783
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,720
people

784
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,000
that are here um so that's good i did

785
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,760
put it in the chat again

786
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,480
i know some people had to drop on and

787
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,480
off that's okay

788
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,040
um

789
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:58,720
got a lot of uh things on this list

790
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,400
so i added autonomy for you

791
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,640
um i like that argue and forgive

792
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,839
i like argue and forgive on the list um

793
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,520
there's only a minute left oh there's a

794
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,520
massive list let me go fix that

795
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,839
and send it

796
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
so i'm just doing a little bit of

797
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,280
pruning

798
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,599
to make sure that people don't put all

799
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,680
of their lists inside of one post-it

800
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,320
because that means we can't move them

801
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,359
around as easily

802
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,720
is that a big list oh no

803
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,280
it's just a big a big statement

804
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,640
okay so there's 20 seconds left i'm

805
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,000
gonna close the rooms in about

806
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,680
10 seconds um because it takes about 10

807
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
seconds for the rooms to close

808
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,000
so

809
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:01,440
i um after i've done that i will have a

810
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:05,760
little video for microsoft on here's

811
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:10,560
what's not working okay

812
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:13,119
oh there's another big list let me oh

813
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,119
what happened

814
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,560
people are probably worried because like

815
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,680
where did my post-its go and it's

816
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,400
because i'm

817
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,800
making them into smaller post-its wow

818
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,440
we've got quite a lot of stuff

819
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,440
right let me close the rooms uh

820
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,440
oh i have to close them each one do i

821
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,599
because we had a little failure of the

822
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
breakout rooms i'm just gonna

823
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,040
go through and click these a little bit

824
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,160
of management for me

825
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,160
everybody's on their way back

826
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,800
very interesting

827
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,800
yes i can see people coming back

828
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,440
okay ah peter how you doing

829
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,800
good how are you doing good i hope

830
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
there weren't too many people that ended

831
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
up in a room on their own

832
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,400
that is sometimes unfortunate when we go

833
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,520
off in pairs but at least when we go

834
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,880
into two pairs

835
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,040
hopefully you still didn't end up in a

836
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,400
room on your own that's that's kind of

837
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,599
painful

838
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
um definitely feedback on the experience

839
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,160
at the end

840
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,119
is awesome um i usually max i usually

841
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,280
have in

842
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,319
classes live virtual classes about 20

843
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,000
people

844
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,040
so 29 uh 30 is is is quite a lot

845
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,240
for for for managing here but we got an

846
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,640
awesome list of things out of that

847
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,680
that's quite a lot of things on there

848
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,160
um then we see anything missing i'll

849
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,000
give you a second just to have a look

850
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,800
um across that list there are 26 people

851
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
on the mural

852
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,119
a oh of blanks i'm just getting rid of

853
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,880
the blanks

854
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,319
there's a whole bunch of really big ones

855
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,560
so let's make them a little bit

856
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:24,960
smaller middle

857
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:28,000
if you see duplicates put them together

858
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,480
and maybe um maybe we

859
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,760
we delete one i don't see too many

860
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,640
duplicates this is good lots of

861
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,079
different words

862
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,839
so it's okay if different words mean the

863
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,359
same thing because

864
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,000
sometimes there's a little bit of nuance

865
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,000
there isn't there

866
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,839
do you see any uh patterns there peter

867
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:08,560
is mutual respect actually well

868
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,640
that that's why as a as a tool

869
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,960
one two for all is a really good

870
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,079
technique for building that list because

871
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,560
if uh john or

872
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,160
or peter or george just voiced their

873
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,079
list

874
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,960
they might impede your desire

875
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,400
to add things to that list right you get

876
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,839
a little bit of psychological safety

877
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,240
because you write your own list on your

878
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,640
own

879
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,359
and then you share them with one person

880
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,760
um

881
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,040
so i think that that that works pretty

882
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,960
well

883
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,480
cool oh there's some stuff just in fact

884
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,839
there's psychological safety

885
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,560
way up in the corner i just brought that

886
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,560
down

887
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,800
argue and forgive i still like that one

888
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,000
that's one of my favorites

889
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,640
there's a lot of good things in here um

890
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,520
i'm going to we're going to use this

891
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,440
output

892
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,400
as an input for the next exercise okay

893
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,079
but i have um a little a little thing uh

894
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,280
to discuss

895
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:12,079
first how many of you

896
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,960
are familiar with the agile manifesto

897
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,000
how many of you familiar with that oh

898
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,800
there's a couple people putting their

899
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,440
thumbs up

900
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,720
peter's got his hand up right at least

901
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,920
of the people i can see

902
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,920
oh is that is that kind of

903
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,160
see this is the thing even when somebody

904
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,480
puts their hand up if you can see them

905
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,079
and they're like you know well maybe a

906
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,560
little bit i know a little bit

907
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,200
that's okay right so we're gonna we're

908
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,400
gonna

909
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,599
just go over the high level piece here

910
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,280
so what i have on the screen just now

911
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
there we go i summoned everybody to it

912
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,240
is the top level

913
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,440
page of the agile manifesto this i think

914
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,200
is a lot prettier

915
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,800
than the one online because that is a

916
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,480
horrendous website

917
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,400
uh but um the idea

918
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,119
is that um very specifically

919
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,240
because the things that we're doing are

920
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,400
so

921
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,599
complicated and have never been done

922
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,920
before

923
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,760
the only way we can figure out a good

924
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,920
way to do it

925
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,200
is to do it and figure out whether

926
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,319
that's a good way

927
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,520
right there's a little bit of a chicken

928
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,280
in the egg in there trying to figure out

929
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,160
how do we start this thing how do we get

930
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,079
this thing going

931
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,079
so that's the idea behind we uncover

932
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,400
better ways of developing software

933
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,200
or products of developing products by

934
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,560
doing it

935
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,560
and helping other people do it

936
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,240
right um and i want to be

937
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,119
very specific on the statements in the

938
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,920
middle there

939
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,400
the blue and the orange orange on the

940
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,800
right

941
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,079
for those that are colorblind and that's

942
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,160
that that

943
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,920
i am definitely neither the agile

944
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,119
manifesto is definitely

945
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,800
not saying that those things in

946
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,040
orange on the right are not useful

947
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,240
it is not saying that i i've got to

948
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,760
figure out a way to phrase that that

949
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,800
doesn't have a double negative in it

950
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,680
right but it is saying that processes

951
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,839
and tools comprehensive documentation

952
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,960
contract negotiation and following a

953
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,359
plan

954
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:16,720
are useful things they are useful

955
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,200
okay all it is saying

956
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,079
is that the things on the left in each

957
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,119
row are

958
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,800
more valuable than the thing on the

959
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,560
right

960
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,640
right that doesn't negate the thing on

961
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,760
the right but the thing on the left is

962
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,079
more valuable

963
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,040
so individuals and interactions being

964
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,560
more valuable than processes and tools

965
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,040
processes and tools don't get things

966
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,480
done people do therefore individuals and

967
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,599
interactions are how things

968
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,560
actually happen right

969
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,880
working software is more valuable than

970
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,720
comprehensive documentation

971
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,839
and note it doesn't say documentation is

972
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,400
comprehensive documentation

973
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,960
would your customers rather have the

974
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,119
book

975
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,319
about the product or the product

976
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,680
i think they'd rather have the product

977
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,119
right if you need a book you've probably

978
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,319
not built a very good product but that's

979
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,440
a whole other problem

980
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,599
right and then customer collaboration

981
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,640
over contract negotiation contracts are

982
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,200
awesome right

983
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,319
contracts are like an official working

984
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,880
agreement

985
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,720
between two parties that's all it is an

986
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,920
official working agreement

987
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,240
but if you have to get that contract out

988
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,359
and

989
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,520
sit together and point at it you've

990
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,640
already lost

991
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,599
right you now have zero trust

992
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,599
in that environment

993
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,920
you don't want to have to get to that

994
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,440
point so what would i

995
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,359
rather do than get to the point where

996
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,359
i have to point to the contract i'd

997
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,400
rather talk to my customer

998
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,400
and agree something

999
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,920
right people misinterpret contracts all

1000
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,400
the time they are written in words

1001
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,560
after all um and words don't mean the

1002
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,560
same thing to two people

1003
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,839
especially not in the way we work today

1004
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,760
in a multicultural

1005
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,040
multi-geography world multi-language

1006
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,640
world

1007
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,960
right words mean different things to

1008
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,200
different people

1009
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,520
oh was there a couple of questions there

1010
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,960
or is it hands left over being up

1011
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,960
for from before i can see

1012
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,079
um who's got their hand up who had their

1013
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,440
hand up first

1014
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:35,359
shelton use your hand out cool karth

1015
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,640
sark sarthak and okay cool it's probably

1016
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,559
just

1017
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,559
leftover hands that's cool

1018
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,480
so does that make sense for the edgy

1019
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,480
manifesto

1020
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,000
cool i know i know most of you have

1021
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,280
probably read it and dissected it

1022
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,359
but what we're going to do is we're

1023
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,559
going to take all of these

1024
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,520
um cards that we created

1025
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,520
and i'm going to copy them down here so

1026
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,960
let me copy them down first

1027
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,720
i'll do something about the mess uh

1028
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,680
let me resize them all

1029
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,040
that's gonna take a second there we go

1030
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,680
i've resized them all

1031
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,319
and then i'm gonna build a little grid

1032
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,720
in the middle

1033
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,400
there we go there's a big massive grid

1034
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,119
of these cards

1035
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:28,400
in the middle okay

1036
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:32,240
what i would like you to do is

1037
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,359
grab a card it doesn't have to be yours

1038
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:40,160
right and move it to where

1039
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:42,880
you think best represents that card

1040
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,640
you know like self-organizing i'm gonna

1041
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,839
grab self-organizing

1042
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,079
and it's not processes and tools

1043
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
documentation

1044
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,839
contract following up it's not any of

1045
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,760
those things responding to change maybe

1046
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,440
customer collaboration i think it looks

1047
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:03,839
like somewhere pretty close to

1048
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,839
individuals and interactions

1049
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,280
i guess you're talking to somebody else

1050
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,920
that's cool so i'd like everybody

1051
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,040
in the mural grab a card move it where

1052
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,119
you think

1053
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,559
um best makes sense all right

1054
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:31,839
i i am we can put things wherever

1055
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:31,839
put them all around these ideas

1056
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,839
okay still got a lot left what's this

1057
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,000
one sitting over here let me zoom in a

1058
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,200
bit

1059
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,760
focus on continuous improving working

1060
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,760
agreements

1061
00:49:51,040 --> 00:50:02,400
come on we've got lots of cards to move

1062
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,839
i can indeed drop the link to my raw

1063
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,960
funnily enough that popped up on my

1064
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,960
phone rather than on there

1065
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,200
your mural oh

1066
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,440
now i've got a little message popping up

1067
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,359
now that says i can't post messages

1068
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,720
because i'm not a member of the chat

1069
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,720
it's my meeting damn it

1070
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,920
oh there we go turn it off turn it back

1071
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,640
on again the age-old solution to every

1072
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,640
technical problem

1073
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,200
it's funny how often that works isn't it

1074
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,839
hey

1075
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,400
it's okay to have things on the right

1076
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,599
it's definitely okay to have that

1077
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,000
i can see there's a couple of things

1078
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:57,280
down following a plan around goals and

1079
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,280
direction yeah that's good

1080
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,559
some things might go you might think oh

1081
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,720
well that could go in two places

1082
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,960
right that that's okay just pick what

1083
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,839
you think is the most right

1084
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,640
it's the pattern that's emerging that's

1085
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,640
more important

1086
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,480
hey

1087
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,680
i'm gonna move that oh well somebody's

1088
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,839
still editing it

1089
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:30,240
this is a title that's unfortunately

1090
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,240
covered

1091
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,319
okay

1092
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,319
john what what do you notice

1093
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,839
oh heck oh heck of a lot of the things i

1094
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:51,040
moved over to the left right versus the

1095
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,040
right

1096
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,240
and well i've specifically asked the

1097
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,760
question what builds great teams

1098
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,000
because hopefully we can agree that

1099
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,160
great teams build great products

1100
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,359
bad teams don't build good products

1101
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:08,480
right that's that's

1102
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:10,319
kind of and it makes sense doesn't it

1103
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,920
right people that are not happy not

1104
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:16,480
interested disrespectful to each other

1105
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,800
goofing off right we're not gonna get

1106
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,960
good products out of that group

1107
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,520
even if we have awesome ideas we're not

1108
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,119
going to get good products out of that

1109
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,040
so the differentiator between building

1110
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,040
bad products and good products

1111
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:36,240
is great teams and building great teams

1112
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:38,240
has very little if anything

1113
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,599
to do with those things on the right

1114
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,400
processes and tools

1115
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,640
documentation contracts plans

1116
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,680
not not not super useful in building

1117
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,040
great products

1118
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,040
they still have value right

1119
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,640
because we need to set direction i

1120
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,880
there's a couple of uh i

1121
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,559
i did go and read the a couple of the

1122
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,319
things around following a plan and

1123
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:03,680
they're about goals

1124
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:06,559
right and setting direction that's good

1125
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,559
we need those things

1126
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,920
i've got an interesting question for you

1127
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:15,280
to think about

1128
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,319
where does your spend most of its

1129
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:22,880
time and effort

1130
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,880
is it on the left or on the right

1131
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,800
my organization that was unfortunately

1132
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,000
uh much more

1133
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,040
skewed to the right than the left even

1134
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,960
in organizations that i

1135
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:45,040
talk fairly well about agility

1136
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:50,400
right i still see a lot of right bias

1137
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,400
rather than left by us in this story

1138
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,040
that this is a really uh true

1139
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,280
that's true i think people for big

1140
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,040
companies you know

1141
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:08,200
big names especially in the aspect of

1142
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,200
processes processes if they're not good

1143
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,200
[Music]

1144
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,800
they want to process for everything and

1145
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,800
you can't change the process because

1146
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,520
that's the way we do things here

1147
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,000
yeah someone told me these things

1148
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,040
haven't been done

1149
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,040
so no

1150
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,200
yeah yeah i i worked with merrill lynch

1151
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,359
for

1152
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,599
a number of years we had a lot of

1153
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,480
processes that didn't make any sense for

1154
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,599
the work that

1155
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,200
i was doing but made sense

1156
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,960
for maybe work that other people were

1157
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,319
doing but

1158
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,319
our work was unrelated

1159
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,480
i'd like to give it i'd like to give a

1160
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,520
shout out

1161
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:55,040
actually um in

1162
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:58,559
that if they are ingrained

1163
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,000
simple and easy then they actually make

1164
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,720
like

1165
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,079
they make life better so what are the

1166
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,119
things that i've been given slightly

1167
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,920
insane about

1168
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,880
at the moment quite a large uk

1169
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
organization

1170
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,400
is is that the the company's got

1171
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,839
i don't know how many how many bits of

1172
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,559
it and everyone stores their documents

1173
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:21,040
somewhere

1174
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,040
different i'm trying to initiate a

1175
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,000
and that should be our team process

1176
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,760
because i don't want i don't i don't

1177
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,200
hear someone in six months time saying

1178
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,720
oh i'm sorry i screwed this up when i

1179
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,839
was working on the wrong version yeah i

1180
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,319
totally agree

1181
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,760
peter and i i would i would have that as

1182
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,000
part of the working agreement that the

1183
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,040
team

1184
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,799
creates right how are we going to

1185
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,640
operate as a team

1186
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:13,680
but that document is an i

1187
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,720
is an output of individuals and

1188
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,400
interactions

1189
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,480
right we have an interaction we talk

1190
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,200
about what our rules are going to be

1191
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,920
we agree as a team to those rules and

1192
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,359
then they become our process

1193
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,680
but if we find later on down the line

1194
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,839
that that process is not working for us

1195
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,839
anymore

1196
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,200
we need to get together have a

1197
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,720
conversation to figure out what the new

1198
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,440
process is

1199
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,040
so we're not wedded to those processes

1200
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,720
to do or die

1201
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,079
right like like was mentioned in the

1202
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,440
comment you know

1203
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,359
they cannot be changed they've been

1204
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,400
there since before you were born

1205
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,400
type of processes um and i think that's

1206
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,799
more what the processes and tools

1207
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,640
is is implying that they're valuable but

1208
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,200
not as valuable as just talking to each

1209
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:04,640
other and figuring things out

1210
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,640
and ma man leo do you have a question

1211
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,559
yes martin yes martin i wanted to ask

1212
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,119
your view

1213
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,119
on the following a plan

1214
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:29,760
agile teams that also do discovery

1215
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:33,520
yeah so um there's definitely a lot of

1216
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,680
um uh

1217
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:41,200
i guess controversy discussion arguments

1218
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,319
um around that that topic i i don't have

1219
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,599
a problem with

1220
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:48,160
any metrics that provide benefit to the

1221
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,520
team and benefit to the organization

1222
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:55,200
right um it's when

1223
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:58,319
metrics have a negative impact on

1224
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,880
teams abilities to deliver that i would

1225
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,920
want to

1226
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,000
question those metrics um

1227
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,680
and figure out how can we do it better

1228
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,960
so okrs

1229
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,480
um as they are defined

1230
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,960
if you read a book about okrs

1231
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,520
is going to talk about something that is

1232
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,960
achievable that's realistic

1233
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,599
um that that is that measures

1234
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,040
valuable things and that sounds

1235
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,799
perfectly reasonable

1236
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,680
um i know that the azure devops team

1237
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:33,280
at microsoft they they use okrs and they

1238
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,280
they did for many years

1239
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,839
very successfully and they are agile

1240
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,160
teams so i i think it can be a

1241
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:42,960
complementary practice

1242
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,359
right but it can also be detrimental if

1243
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,040
if

1244
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,960
if used to um

1245
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:54,400
i find okrs can often um be used as a

1246
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,119
as a as a as a stick uh to beat the team

1247
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,960
with

1248
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,799
um because they're not meeting their

1249
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,280
stretch goals right

1250
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,119
when okrs were not really designed this

1251
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,599
is my understanding of kr's

1252
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,280
not really designed as stretch goals

1253
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,640
you're only expected

1254
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:14,319
to meet 70 of your okr

1255
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,480
right so yeah so

1256
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,000
it's built into the ocr that you're not

1257
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,880
meant to meet the whole thing you're

1258
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,079
just meant to get

1259
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:25,200
within a distance of it so i

1260
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,520
like if it's more like like a guardrail

1261
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,079
and

1262
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,040
providing direction yeah exactly if it's

1263
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,920
useful

1264
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,880
use it if it stops being useful stop

1265
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,920
doing it

1266
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,839
right it's painful stuff

1267
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,839
that's the way i look at it but just be

1268
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,119
conscious of how it's being useful and

1269
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:41,839
how it might be dangerous as well

1270
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,839
because

1271
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,880
sometimes these things have effects that

1272
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,079
we we

1273
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,440
don't notice thank you

1274
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:55,839
so we've talked about

1275
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:57,599
um i think uh

1276
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,760
how many people do we have now let's

1277
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:02,319
have a look

1278
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,200
i think i'm i i i'm going to i'm going

1279
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,839
to give you

1280
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,880
an op i'm going to give you an option

1281
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:10,400
okay

1282
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,119
um so the next exercise i think will

1283
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,040
take about

1284
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,559
20 minutes which wouldn't leave us a lot

1285
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,680
of time um

1286
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,720
for what i think is quite an important

1287
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,440
piece

1288
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:23,520
um so i'd like to skip the the

1289
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,200
principles exercise that i've got set up

1290
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,799
here even though i spent a lot of time

1291
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,920
on it when i saw that 80 people had

1292
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,520
signed up

1293
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,040
to make it maybe support that many

1294
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,079
people um but

1295
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,200
i i think we need to skip that in order

1296
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,040
to

1297
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,680
get to some of the additional meat does

1298
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,680
that make sense

1299
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,760
so this is how it works people that are

1300
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,400
on camera i get to

1301
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,680
get to uh have their opinions voiced and

1302
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,400
then everybody else gets to

1303
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,520
live with it that's that's what happens

1304
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,079
um

1305
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,520
cool so i want i want to talk about

1306
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:58,079
connection

1307
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,960
some of you might already be familiar

1308
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,680
with connection

1309
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,520
david snowden's work um there's a lot of

1310
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,960
really good content out there

1311
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:10,640
there's the original hbr uh review

1312
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,680
and i think i think i add something

1313
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,160
in my explanation of it um so i'm going

1314
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,520
to

1315
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,559
going to to to walk through my story

1316
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,040
i'm going to make sure these are

1317
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:24,000
unlocked of

1318
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,720
connection um within the context and

1319
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,880
this

1320
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,000
that that's why i've got at the top this

1321
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,440
is martin's

1322
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,480
interpretation of of connection

1323
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,760
um and that that's really so i know

1324
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,319
um if this is on uh linkedin if this is

1325
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,720
on

1326
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,359
uh other platforms david might go have a

1327
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,920
look

1328
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,480
uh and skip to that point and go martin

1329
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,480
you're completely wrong and that's okay

1330
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,640
um it's just my interpretation and

1331
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:56,319
hopefully that will start a conversation

1332
01:01:52,640 --> 01:02:00,559
so the kinetic model really

1333
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:04,480
it talks about um four areas

1334
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:06,880
of our environments that we do work in

1335
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,400
okay we do work in these four

1336
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,160
environments

1337
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,920
um so there's there's a space in the

1338
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,400
middle here

1339
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,000
that we like to call disorder right

1340
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,359
that's where we have no defined

1341
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
process and that's usually okay up to

1342
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,640
about 20

1343
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
people in your company um and you can

1344
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,319
get away with

1345
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,720
we're just making it up as we go along

1346
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:32,799
okay but at some point

1347
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,280
there's too much going on to support

1348
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:36,799
support that and you end up in disorder

1349
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,720
things are not working out things are

1350
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,400
not happening when you expect them to

1351
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,119
there aren't the accountabilities that

1352
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,880
we need okay

1353
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,720
um so we're not really really going to

1354
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,400
focus on on disorder at all

1355
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,680
don't don't be there you know come on

1356
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,440
can you summon everyone to the right

1357
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:56,319
part of the diagram yes i can

1358
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,039
thank you for that oh there we go ah

1359
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,240
there we go

1360
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,280
perfect that's probably a lot better yes

1361
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,880
please

1362
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,400
now i now i know what picture you're

1363
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,000
talking about yeah

1364
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,039
um so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring in the

1365
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,480
first one which is the the simple world

1366
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:16,400
of work simple environment um

1367
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:20,480
the characteristic of simple

1368
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,240
right is that we know everything

1369
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,680
right we know everything about that

1370
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,520
piece of work we know everything that

1371
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,920
could happen that's going to happen

1372
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,359
everything and it's pretty pretty simple

1373
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,720
and straightforward

1374
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:35,760
what might uh shelton be the the

1375
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:39,039
the way to approach that type of work

1376
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,039
you know everything about it

1377
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,240
what might oh he's got to jump on

1378
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,240
another call

1379
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,960
always i always pick it so it's the

1380
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:52,400
there's this

1381
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:55,680
expression jdi right and it stands for

1382
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,119
just do it yeah right you don't you

1383
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,280
don't need a process you don't need

1384
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,119
anything

1385
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,720
it's uh the things that have been done

1386
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,200
so many times that the whole

1387
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,160
end-to-end process is so well known that

1388
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,400
they're it's just

1389
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:12,559
just yeah yeah you just go look up the

1390
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,680
explainer video on youtube and follow it

1391
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,839
and you're good to go

1392
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,520
right that's that's that's how that's

1393
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,039
how we do lots of things

1394
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,359
now at least that's how i do lots of

1395
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,079
things uh is just look well

1396
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,720
youtube explains how how how it works

1397
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,119
and then i

1398
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,799
i that's it done right so that's that

1399
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,680
simple world and we can have those best

1400
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,359
practices

1401
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,520
right that youtube video is just the

1402
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,119
explainer for how to do that okay

1403
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,119
maybe there's multiple ones that talk

1404
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,599
about the same thing but there's really

1405
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,599
one

1406
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,640
one good way to do it that's best

1407
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,960
practices

1408
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,760
lots of organizations bandy about the

1409
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:49,440
term best practices

1410
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:52,559
right but they're only valuable

1411
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,319
within this simple world because there

1412
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,599
is one way to do it when you know

1413
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,440
everything

1414
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,200
but when there's a little bit things get

1415
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,079
a little bit more

1416
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,760
you know confused we end up in the

1417
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:05,680
complicated

1418
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,160
environment in the complicated

1419
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:12,400
environment the main characteristic

1420
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,400
is that there are uh

1421
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,280
some unknowns right most things are

1422
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,920
known

1423
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,760
right we've maybe got i i don't really

1424
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,200
it's just most things are known but if i

1425
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,799
was to put a number on it let's say

1426
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,720
there's up to a 15

1427
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,240
variance between what we think is going

1428
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,280
to happen and what what's actually going

1429
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,599
to happen

1430
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,520
right i just made up that number so

1431
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,400
don't don't hold it as a as an actual

1432
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,240
number it's just

1433
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,599
a normal statistic made up on the spot

1434
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,319
um some is unknown but most things are

1435
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,440
known

1436
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:49,119
and in that world we can use plan

1437
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,119
driven good practices

1438
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,640
right we can just work a plan we can

1439
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,960
deal with 15

1440
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:58,000
variants right we can just work it think

1441
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,079
if you were on a

1442
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,440
uh you'd bought a plot of land and you

1443
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,440
were going to build 20 houses

1444
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,520
right you know what the designs are for

1445
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,039
the houses you're going to build because

1446
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,599
you've had an architect

1447
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,520
design them right so you know exactly

1448
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,440
how much wood you need

1449
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,720
and your foreman is going to be able to

1450
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,960
give you a good

1451
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,039
practice on when you're going to need

1452
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,359
the electricians the plasterers and how

1453
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,960
long

1454
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,960
far for each house and how much

1455
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,119
materials you're going to need

1456
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,079
most things are known and then you get

1457
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,920
the weird thing

1458
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,160
of some materials were delivered too

1459
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,039
early and warped in the rain and you've

1460
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,480
got to order more

1461
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:38,960
right that's part of your 15 variance or

1462
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,640
that as what quite often happens that

1463
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,640
plumber doesn't turn up

1464
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,920
right when they're supposed to that's

1465
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,520
part of your 15

1466
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,599
variant so how do you then deal with

1467
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,960
that so you have a plan you maybe use a

1468
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,559
gantt chart and you just manage that

1469
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,000
plan

1470
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,839
right everything's everything's going to

1471
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,839
take that time that make sense

1472
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,960
so so i i co i i'm going to call out

1473
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:04,079
that that is the world

1474
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,680
of product delivery

1475
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,520
right anytime you're delivering

1476
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,720
something that has already been

1477
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,920
designed and already exists

1478
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,920
right i don't know if you've ever seen

1479
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,799
houses arriving at a building site but

1480
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,359
quite a lot of them come flat packed

1481
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,559
right they have the the the the the

1482
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,319
steep i don't know what they what they

1483
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:25,680
call that thing in the roof the

1484
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,880
triangles they're all pre-made at the

1485
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,640
factory

1486
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,000
you know they they just arrive and

1487
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,720
you're assembling

1488
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
like a massive airfix kit you're just

1489
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,599
assembling everything

1490
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,520
so that's product delivery whether

1491
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,119
you're you're building cars

1492
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:44,720
um and we can use uh prince2

1493
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,440
exists a lot in that space

1494
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,920
right um i think i can't actually can't

1495
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,680
remember what lt

1496
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,039
ltps stands for but i'm pretty sure it

1497
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,240
sits in that space as well do you

1498
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,480
remember what ltps

1499
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,520
stands for peter i think you would be

1500
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,599
someone who would know that sort of

1501
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,319
thing

1502
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,319
no no

1503
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,839
well i think i tell you what i'm going

1504
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,839
to stick it back over there

1505
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,359
in 15 seconds yeah yeah google will know

1506
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,920
um

1507
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:19,440
so product delivery prince2 pmi plan

1508
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,159
driven techniques

1509
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,960
right they tend to focus on plan driven

1510
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:25,759
techniques

1511
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,400
the the prince2 and pmi institutes do

1512
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,920
have

1513
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,759
uh some um agile techniques

1514
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,759
as well that they introduce into that

1515
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,880
story and that makes sense but their

1516
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,000
foundation

1517
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:41,120
is on those plan driven techniques right

1518
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,040
so they're very useful in that space

1519
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:47,920
and then we move on to this complex

1520
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,040
space and in the complex space the

1521
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,159
characteristic

1522
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:54,159
is that most things are unknown

1523
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,400
some things are known but most things

1524
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:59,440
are unknown

1525
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:02,480
a good example of that is if i

1526
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:05,520
asked you to write a book

1527
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:09,040
on a topic right let's say

1528
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:12,159
uh mao you're gonna write a devops book

1529
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,440
okay on devops practices how long

1530
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:14,960
you're not allowed to copy somebody

1531
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,719
else's book you've got to write it from

1532
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,920
scratch it's going to be your book

1533
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:23,839
the publisher is going to publish it how

1534
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,839
long is it going to take you to write it

1535
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,520
two years well that but

1536
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:31,520
where did you get that number from

1537
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,799
yeah you just took a wild what a wag a

1538
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:39,199
wild ass guess absolutely

1539
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,799
just like that whatever yeah yeah i

1540
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,400
don't know what's the number big enough

1541
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:45,120
that i feel comfortable

1542
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,679
i i know people that the the that have

1543
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,600
taken

1544
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,040
way more than two years to to write a

1545
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,520
book because they get

1546
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,960
writer's block or they have to do a

1547
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,800
bunch of research

1548
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,320
or they find out that something they

1549
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,920
thought was true wasn't and they have to

1550
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,520
do something else

1551
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,760
there's all kinds of things that can

1552
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,800
happen if you on your own

1553
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,440
were writing a book imagine you were

1554
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,960
writing

1555
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:10,560
a a book with three friends

1556
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,199
right now now it gets a little bit more

1557
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,719
complex because do we all agree

1558
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,560
with what should be in the book can the

1559
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,600
stories that should be in there

1560
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,040
and the ideas that we're presenting

1561
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,719
things get a little bit more difficult a

1562
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,480
little bit more complicated

1563
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,480
so that's where we end up more in the

1564
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,640
complex space we're doing that something

1565
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,719
that has never been done before that

1566
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,520
content doesn't exist

1567
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,560
most content creation exists in that

1568
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,080
space

1569
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,719
all software development is

1570
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:41,760
in that space because we wouldn't write

1571
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,719
it right

1572
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,840
you know that developers uh are are

1573
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,400
notoriously

1574
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,679
lazy people right we are we're very

1575
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,400
deliberately lazy

1576
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,920
i would rather go use a framework that

1577
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,199
somebody else has built than build

1578
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,159
something myself

1579
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,719
i'd much rather do that because i have

1580
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,040
less

1581
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,719
unknowns i can use something that

1582
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,080
pre-exists and has a little bit of

1583
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:06,080
documentation

1584
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,679
anytime we've got a cup code we're in

1585
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,120
that complex space

1586
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:14,560
and in that space we want to use

1587
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:17,600
empirical management practices

1588
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,920
right and that empiricism means that our

1589
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:24,080
practices that make sense

1590
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,600
are going to emerge and change over time

1591
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,760
right what's right at the beginning of

1592
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,560
the project might not be right at the

1593
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:32,560
end of the product or project

1594
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,159
right we might have to change and adapt

1595
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,960
the way we do things

1596
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:38,840
so i would put that in this category of

1597
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,760
product

1598
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,360
development right we're building uh

1599
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,880
products that don't exist yet we're

1600
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:49,120
developing products

1601
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:52,560
uh scrum was designed for that space

1602
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:54,320
uh the kanban method was designed for

1603
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,000
that space and i'm very specifically

1604
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,040
saying the kanban method

1605
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,679
right not just kanban as a

1606
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,520
as a as a generic thing or lean right

1607
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:08,320
lean applies everywhere

1608
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:11,360
but the kanban method sits in that space

1609
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,480
um and then we get to the

1610
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:16,000
last environment which i'm sure many of

1611
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,280
you have been in

1612
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,280
which is the chaotic space right

1613
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,040
some people end up there accidentally

1614
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,159
because their project's a disaster

1615
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:28,320
although that might be disorder okay

1616
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:29,360
but in the chaotic space everything is

1617
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,199
unknown

1618
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,800
you have no idea what's going on what

1619
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:37,360
the right thing is what even you need to

1620
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,239
build or do in that space we need to

1621
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,760
experiment

1622
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,280
we have novel practices we're going to

1623
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,800
make something unique that we're going

1624
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,679
to use this once

1625
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,679
and then we're not going to use it again

1626
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,480
and

1627
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,159
this for me is the product discovery

1628
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,400
phase that bit where we don't know what

1629
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,159
it is we're going to build yet

1630
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,320
right the result of that might be a

1631
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,679
business case right maybe a business

1632
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,640
case that we have to take to somebody it

1633
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,080
might be

1634
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,920
um a a bunch of user stories

1635
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,320
that we're going to put in a backlog

1636
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,520
right that might be the output of that

1637
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:16,800
might just be a hypothesis we think this

1638
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,840
product will be useful to our customers

1639
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,560
that might be the output of that

1640
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,600
and almost all scientific research

1641
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,600
exists in that space

1642
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,760
right you have a vague idea what you're

1643
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,360
going but all the

1644
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,040
have you ever noticed that all of the

1645
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:36,480
best scientific

1646
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,560
uh uh outcomes have come

1647
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,560
from people who weren't studying for

1648
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,400
that out they weren't looking into that

1649
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,320
outcome they discovered something else

1650
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,360
along the way like oh

1651
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,280
look that works or this happens or this

1652
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,159
works that way

1653
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,280
they say oh that's interesting that's

1654
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,760
interesting

1655
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:56,719
yeah but that's that's product discovery

1656
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,840
that that's

1657
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,400
um a product owner might sit in that

1658
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,239
space

1659
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,080
quite a lot of the time figuring out

1660
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,520
what they're going to build next

1661
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,920
right it might be a little bit more

1662
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:11,280
informed than chaotic

1663
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,360
but um

1664
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,120
it still might be in the product

1665
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:18,080
discovery space

1666
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,960
so i'm going to i i hate to break your

1667
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,320
illusion but

1668
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,320
i mean that's a bit of a myth

1669
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,520
the scientific additives gravity

1670
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,320
you knew what he was up to einstein knew

1671
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,560
what he was up to

1672
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,800
ball knew what he was up to but the

1673
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,300
other really smart ones

1674
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,040
do you what he was up to

1675
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:40,880
[Music]

1676
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,280
i put it on the bad dude but anyway

1677
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,280
let's

1678
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:56,560
um but what i would like you to think

1679
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,679
about here

1680
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,679
is how much time

1681
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:11,840
does the work that you do spend in each

1682
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:11,840
of these species

1683
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,840
going to mute joseph there uh

1684
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,719
every product and project that you work

1685
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,920
on

1686
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,520
will spend some amount of time in every

1687
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,199
single one of the maybe except for

1688
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,560
simple but it will spend some time in

1689
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:28,719
product discovery

1690
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:31,440
some time in product development and

1691
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:33,840
some time in product delivery

1692
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:35,520
right where i'd like you to i think

1693
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,199
peter's preempted there because

1694
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,000
he's maybe been here is that peter

1695
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:42,800
dragging one around no not yet

1696
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,560
oh i just you're usually the oh it's mal

1697
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:48,320
you're usually the culprit peter

1698
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:51,440
um so what i'd like you to do is grab

1699
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,719
one of these little uh auburn dots in

1700
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,840
the top right

1701
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:58,400
of this view and drag it onto the

1702
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,400
display

1703
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:04,480
where you think your product

1704
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,920
or your product spends most of its time

1705
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,760
do you spend most of your time in

1706
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,960
product development

1707
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,280
do you spend most of your time in

1708
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,560
product delivery

1709
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,880
what about discovery right there's lots

1710
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,560
of

1711
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:21,840
organizations that spend a significant

1712
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,840
amount of time in discovery

1713
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:25,600
yeah just grab a grab a dot pull it on

1714
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,880
there

1715
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,880
oh that dot went behind let me

1716
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:39,040
let me out whoa make all of those dots

1717
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:42,320
bring to front awesome i'm gonna

1718
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:44,320
unlock that and send it the

1719
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,840
back and there's that dot coming back

1720
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,600
there we go

1721
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,880
i made all of the the dots that are on

1722
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:52,159
the top right are now

1723
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,679
uh always at the front

1724
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:55,199
so grab a dot there's more there's more

1725
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,760
people than that there's

1726
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:59,280
24 people in the mural one two three

1727
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,120
four five six seven eight nine there's

1728
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,760
only ten less than half of you

1729
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,480
have moved a dot so grab a dot where do

1730
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,440
you spend

1731
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,440
most of your time

1732
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,040
oh i i'm quite interested that there's

1733
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,920
two there

1734
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,679
in product discovery i'll share the link

1735
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,000
once more

1736
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:22,400
absolutely i can let me put it in the

1737
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,400
chat

1738
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:31,840
i have indeed put it in the chat

1739
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,080
okay

1740
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:45,199
there's a little bit of a pattern

1741
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:46,719
emerging there as well isn't there peter

1742
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,840
so this is this is this is the downside

1743
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,640
of me picking on people with their

1744
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,760
camera on

1745
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,080
there's lots of people have turned their

1746
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,320
camera off i think that's maybe a

1747
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,640
a dysfunction to that that behavior or

1748
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,560
some functional outcome

1749
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:59,840
so it looks like we've got two people in

1750
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,760
product discovery

1751
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,280
that spend a little bit of time in the

1752
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,960
chaotic world

1753
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,719
um of not knowing what it is we're

1754
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,960
building right and we've got to figure

1755
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,239
that piece out they might be product

1756
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,920
owners

1757
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,840
right they're they're they're working

1758
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:15,600
inside of organizations trying to figure

1759
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,080
out how do we what's our next big

1760
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,800
product

1761
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,719
how do we even decide what that is how

1762
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,000
do we figure that out

1763
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,840
and then it looks like there's quite a

1764
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,960
few people that are on or

1765
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:30,719
pretty close to product delivery

1766
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,440
one two three four five people are

1767
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,080
on or pretty close to product delivery

1768
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,400
maybe

1769
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,880
your guys are just fine using plan

1770
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,800
driven techniques and managing to plan

1771
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,080
right because you spend the majority of

1772
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,120
your time there

1773
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:47,120
your variance is going to be lower right

1774
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,199
if your variance is low enough that you

1775
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,239
can manage it

1776
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,679
maybe that will work right i i work with

1777
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,679
a number of organizations some

1778
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,800
professional services organizations

1779
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,440
and if the customer comes with a big

1780
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,600
list of

1781
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,000
here's every feature we want our product

1782
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,000
to have

1783
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,880
maybe we're building rebuilding an

1784
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,480
existing product

1785
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,960
maybe we spend quite a lot of time in

1786
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,960
product delivery

1787
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,120
maybe we're doing a migration from

1788
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,560
on-premise

1789
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:22,480
office to cloud office

1790
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,239
right that's that's just a migration

1791
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:26,080
exercise well-known

1792
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,600
ideas we just want to create a plan

1793
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:29,920
who'll be migrating when and work

1794
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,920
through it

1795
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,760
but if we are and do spend most of our

1796
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:40,880
time in that complex space

1797
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:44,080
we need to think differently plan driven

1798
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:46,560
is not going to manage our risk it is

1799
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,080
not going to manage our risk

1800
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,120
because that's why we managed to plan is

1801
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,280
to manage risk

1802
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,120
but if there's so much variance that we

1803
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:57,840
have to rebuild our plan every

1804
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,840
couple of weeks

1805
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,679
that doesn't sound like we're mitigating

1806
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:05,840
risk that we're

1807
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,840
rolling with the change

1808
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,679
manlow did you have a question

1809
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,080
she's good you get your hand up i can

1810
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,120
put it down it's just it might have been

1811
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,760
left over from

1812
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:21,760
before that's cool

1813
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,280
so i think most of you are here because

1814
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,920
you exist in that product development

1815
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,960
world

1816
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,760
right i mean that's that's uh part of

1817
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,600
that

1818
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,040
uh story um but in

1819
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,120
if we are in that product development

1820
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:37,600
world we kind of need

1821
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:39,360
a little bit of a different thing going

1822
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,880
on so i'm gonna i'm gonna try and

1823
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,199
compare some evolutions right uh what's

1824
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,840
the

1825
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:46,800
what's the difference between

1826
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,000
traditional uh plan driven

1827
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,440
and empirical in our in our story and i

1828
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,320
know peter will come up with some

1829
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,080
caveats for

1830
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,400
for for for some of the things that i'll

1831
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,639
mention and that is super cool

1832
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,600
because it all i'm looking at is the the

1833
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,040
common cause there are always exceptions

1834
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,199
uh i know people have been very

1835
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,840
successful in the plan driven world

1836
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,719
and mostly because they adapt their plan

1837
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,040
quickly to

1838
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:12,639
what's really happening in the world um

1839
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,960
but in this example

1840
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:16,560
um i'm going to say we've got a 12-month

1841
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,440
project

1842
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,120
right it's about 12 million of whatever

1843
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,440
monetary unit you like

1844
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:26,239
euros dollars pounds doesn't really

1845
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:29,360
matter it's going to cost 12 million

1846
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:32,239
and a traditional iteration

1847
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,360
might be 12 months right we're not going

1848
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:37,120
to have a working

1849
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:39,520
product until the end of the project

1850
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,960
and our empirical iteration might be two

1851
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,960
weeks

1852
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,000
right i know the scrum guide for example

1853
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,560
says

1854
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
one month or less the agile manifesto

1855
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,040
says a few months

1856
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,080
to a few weeks right um

1857
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,320
but the reality is that 20 years ago

1858
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:58,960
when the agile manifesto was signed in

1859
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,360
25 years ago when the scrum guide

1860
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,960
was first when scrum was first created

1861
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,920
or first presented

1862
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,199
it was really hard to ship software to

1863
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:10,719
production

1864
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:12,960
it was hard today

1865
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,280
it's not hard to ship software to

1866
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,120
production or it shouldn't be

1867
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:20,159
right that might be a technical debt

1868
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:22,080
problem and i teach a class called the

1869
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:24,880
applying professional scrum

1870
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,560
and we break up into teams i give them a

1871
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,159
website to go build

1872
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,239
and they have to go build a website in

1873
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:32,239
teams right

1874
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,679
and this has only been one team ever

1875
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,520
that has done this so it's about teams

1876
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:38,800
of five

1877
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,639
i give them a 30 minute sprint

1878
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,719
to build working products and they're

1879
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,639
going to demo at the end of 30 minutes

1880
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,320
to me the stakeholder right and you're

1881
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:49,360
like holy crap build some

1882
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:52,639
a website in 30 minutes right this

1883
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,800
one team ever not only

1884
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,440
did they have all of their did they

1885
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,360
build it in visual studio write the code

1886
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,199
but that code was under source control

1887
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:03,440
they had an automated build

1888
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:05,679
and they had an automated deployment

1889
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,800
that continuously delivered the product

1890
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:11,600
to azure and just gave me the url at the

1891
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,600
end of 30 minutes

1892
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:17,040
right if you can if you can do that for

1893
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,719
regardless of how simple your website is

1894
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,560
in 30 minutes

1895
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,120
what could that engineering team do in

1896
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,120
two weeks

1897
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:30,800
right environments setups used to be

1898
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:32,800
a massive problem now those things are

1899
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,320
pretty straightforward i know that

1900
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,199
somebody here will say

1901
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,920
yes but my company won't allow you know

1902
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,719
me to use

1903
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,639
the the cloud and i have to use an

1904
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:45,120
on-premise and it takes me six weeks to

1905
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:48,639
request a new server

1906
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:51,600
you guys are in the minority now right

1907
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,360
agility getting working product into

1908
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,199
production every three weeks

1909
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,679
really requires a different look at

1910
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:59,280
things so let me grab a couple of things

1911
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,320
over here i have i have

1912
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,840
uh some little little pieces to help me

1913
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,920
tell this story

1914
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,920
that i made the other day um and

1915
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:15,040
the first thing i want to talk about

1916
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,480
is is visibility right so let me drag

1917
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,679
visibility on here

1918
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,679
and talk about visibility

1919
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,560
what does visibility look like between a

1920
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:28,159
traditional 12-month project

1921
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,440
and an empirical 12-month project

1922
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:32,800
right so let's say we're going to do two

1923
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,880
weeks prince versus the one year

1924
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,320
effort right i used to work with the

1925
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,600
azure devops team

1926
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:41,040
they uh deliver they used to eight years

1927
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,960
ago they were delivering to production

1928
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,080
every two years

1929
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:49,199
right maybe they had a uh uh um

1930
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,800
release candidate halfway right

1931
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:53,199
so after a year they had something to

1932
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,080
see but then it's another year before

1933
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:57,760
it's actually

1934
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:59,040
shippable right that was visual studio

1935
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,199
eight years ago

1936
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,480
today they do continuous delivery to

1937
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,600
production and deliver

1938
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:05,600
at least every three weeks

1939
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,960
all right so so so doesn't matter how

1940
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,960
big your product is

1941
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,800
the windows team does continuous

1942
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,199
delivery to production

1943
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,600
right that's that's probably one of the

1944
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:20,560
most complicated products in the world

1945
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:23,600
so what does visibility look like on our

1946
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:26,239
for our 12 months

1947
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:28,639
right we've got high visibility at the

1948
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:31,920
start

1949
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:35,040
then it probably drops pretty heavily

1950
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,639
pretty quickly we've got pretty much no

1951
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,280
visibility throughout the life of the

1952
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,679
project

1953
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:42,080
and then when we deliver our product to

1954
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:45,120
production at the end

1955
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,120
we get our lovely gold star right we've

1956
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:50,719
got our product

1957
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:53,679
now visibility might not drop to zero

1958
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:55,120
right but inside of that bubble at what

1959
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,320
point

1960
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:00,639
does your customer see working software

1961
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,440
right see a working product that they

1962
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,280
can go use

1963
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,880
it's really not till the end in a

1964
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,840
traditional model

1965
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,920
i know that we talk about it spiral came

1966
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,840
along to help mitigate that maybe we've

1967
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,280
got working product in a shorter time

1968
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,560
frame every once every six months or

1969
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,719
once a quarter

1970
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,760
or whatever that is but it's it's still

1971
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:23,440
a long time

1972
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:26,400
if we were to look at that idea in a

1973
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,760
two week window i've got my little

1974
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,199
pre-made this is so that you don't have

1975
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:33,040
to put up with my drawing

1976
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:36,960
right because my drawing sucks um

1977
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,400
so what does visibility look like

1978
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:39,760
i'm gonna i i don't know whether i

1979
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,280
should put it down here or put it up

1980
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,639
there i'm gonna put it up there just for

1981
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,719
fun

1982
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:50,719
right but in that two week window

1983
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:53,360
we get visibility every two weeks

1984
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:55,440
we should have a working product a

1985
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:58,000
usable thing

1986
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,040
every two weeks if we're on a two week

1987
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,360
iteration

1988
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:04,400
if we're doing a one month iteration it

1989
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:07,280
would be once a month right but

1990
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,080
this is two weeks we still get to the

1991
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,120
same star

1992
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,840
we get to the same place but how's your

1993
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,600
customers comfort level now

1994
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,159
right they've got high visibility they

1995
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:22,159
can see what's going on in a regular

1996
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:24,159
frame maybe at some point they

1997
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,520
figure out that we're not doing the

1998
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:27,440
thing that they need

1999
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,520
right so maybe they get an opportunity

2000
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:34,560
to change

2001
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,560
so that gets to this idea of change

2002
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,400
what does change management look like

2003
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:48,400
in this space what does our ability to

2004
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,400
change look like in traditional

2005
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:55,120
probably starts fairly high

2006
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:58,840
right we can change anything at the

2007
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:01,199
start but then we get that contract

2008
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,800
signed and maybe suddenly things aren't

2009
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,080
so changeable

2010
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,480
maybe we're going to put things in the

2011
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:09,760
way like change requests

2012
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:11,679
in the way of people making changes

2013
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,880
but in an empirical space where we're

2014
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,480
delivering

2015
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,800
usable product at the end of every

2016
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:19,120
sprint

2017
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,280
we're still going to reduce in our

2018
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,880
ability to change

2019
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,280
right because we've built stuff

2020
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,199
stuff we've already built is harder to

2021
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,199
change than stuff we haven't built yet

2022
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,920
but if at the end of every single

2023
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:39,120
iteration

2024
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:41,120
we have a usable product that works the

2025
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:44,719
customer is free to change

2026
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,719
anything we've not started

2027
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,760
anything we've not started they can

2028
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,760
change

2029
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,040
but in a traditional model we've

2030
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,800
effectively

2031
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,280
we've not actually started everything

2032
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,360
but we're not working on the product

2033
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,719
in a logical manner so we have something

2034
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:03,920
that works every

2035
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:06,639
short period of time right

2036
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,639
halfway through my life cycle for my my

2037
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:11,520
12 month project

2038
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,480
i can't stop and go work on something

2039
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,360
else

2040
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,880
unless i'm willing to lose all of the

2041
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:18,480
value that i've already added in the

2042
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,320
product

2043
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,040
because i can't realize it because it's

2044
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:25,280
not a working product yet

2045
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,040
so it gives it allows us to maintain

2046
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,679
that ability to change what we're

2047
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,239
working on

2048
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,520
change how things are going throughout

2049
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:34,080
the life of the product

2050
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:34,800
we still get to the same place right in

2051
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,840
that story

2052
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,360
change management we still get the same

2053
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:40,719
place hopefully customers are happier

2054
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:43,840
because we're talking to them

2055
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:46,159
with our visibility every two weeks and

2056
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,760
offering them the ability to change even

2057
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:50,840
if they don't change stuff

2058
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:54,080
so they feel more involved

2059
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,040
okay so then there's there's there's an

2060
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:58,159
interesting one

2061
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:58,639
there's this idea of risk how do we

2062
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,760
manage

2063
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:03,360
risk in this new world because if things

2064
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,280
change so much and we have such a high

2065
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,080
degree of variance we cannot control

2066
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,800
risk with more

2067
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,920
control right because the control is

2068
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,560
just going to fall apart

2069
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,880
because things are changing too much the

2070
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,400
world is changing the world is unknown

2071
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,520
we don't know what we're going to build

2072
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,639
we don't know if it's going to work we

2073
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,199
don't know if that technology is going

2074
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,000
to be

2075
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:24,000
put in three months time uh we don't we

2076
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,840
don't know lots of things

2077
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:31,920
right so it's high levels of risk

2078
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,920
so if we've got 12 million

2079
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,280
i'm gonna put pounds in there because

2080
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,040
you know

2081
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,159
i'm british i think that's worth about

2082
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:40,159
50 euros today

2083
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,360
we're pretty pretty soon peter and i are

2084
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,800
going to go to the supermarket and have

2085
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,840
to pay a million pounds for a loaf of

2086
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,199
bread

2087
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,199
i think that's in the next three weeks

2088
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,760
at that point we will exit stage left

2089
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,120
i'm pretty sure that's

2090
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,040
i'm pretty sure that's what they're

2091
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,920
waiting on um

2092
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,480
so we've got this this this risk model

2093
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,880
so in

2094
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:06,560
our in in the traditional model oh sorry

2095
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,320
i've not locked that yet so if you go

2096
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,400
try and drag stuff around it's gonna

2097
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,760
gonna move stuff

2098
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:16,400
throughout the 12 months

2099
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:18,719
we have 12 million dollars at risk 12

2100
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:21,520
million pounds even

2101
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,639
right on day one of the project your

2102
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,040
customer gives you

2103
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,400
here's a check for 12 million pounds

2104
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,840
right

2105
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,400
and then when do you give them the

2106
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:36,080
product at the end of the 12 months

2107
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:39,280
so every week every day every month

2108
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:41,679
between them giving you the money

2109
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:44,480
and you giving them a product they have

2110
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,000
12 million pounds at risk

2111
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:48,000
that i think that customer is going to

2112
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,199
be freaking out

2113
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,360
right they're going to want more

2114
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:54,320
controls they're going to be more

2115
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,320
at things on there

2116
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:02,560
whereas if we bring in

2117
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,360
our empirical process i know i'm i'm

2118
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,159
running over

2119
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:07,840
if you can stay stay but um i know i'm

2120
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,880
running over a little bit

2121
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:14,320
um we're only going to be spending

2122
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:16,960
500k 500 000 pounds

2123
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:17,920
for a sprint that's an expensive sprint

2124
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,440
right but

2125
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,760
yeah it's what it is maybe there's lots

2126
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,440
of teams working on it but at the end of

2127
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:25,280
that 500k we're going to give them a

2128
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:27,280
working product

2129
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,560
a working usable product that they could

2130
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,080
deploy to production

2131
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:35,040
if it had amortized enough value

2132
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,080
well what's their risk at that point

2133
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,960
zero

2134
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:40,560
they have no risk right their only risk

2135
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,800
is they've not got an adequate return on

2136
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,199
investment we've given them the product

2137
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,960
and the risk is that the product crap

2138
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:49,600
right so they can look at the product

2139
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,560
and then decide whether to give us

2140
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,159
another

2141
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:58,400
500 000 for another iteration

2142
01:32:54,159 --> 01:33:01,120
on the product they're in control

2143
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:04,159
of their risk even if we signed up to a

2144
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:06,320
12-month plan

2145
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:08,080
right if we suddenly deliver something

2146
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,440
that is not what they expected

2147
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,600
not going to solve their business

2148
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:14,560
problem why would they want to spend

2149
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:17,199
more than the 500k

2150
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,760
they never have more than 500k at risk

2151
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:22,880
at any point in time

2152
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,880
so it reduces our risk profile and then

2153
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:28,239
the last one

2154
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:32,239
and then i'll uh wrap up is

2155
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:36,719
um value amortizing value

2156
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:38,159
okay oh let's not do that let's do

2157
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,440
i'm gonna drag all of these over a

2158
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:41,440
little bit so i can access them

2159
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,040
what does our risk are our value profile

2160
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,600
look like

2161
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,800
well if we don't give them any product

2162
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,880
till the end

2163
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,040
then they get no value till the end do

2164
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,040
they

2165
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:59,120
right no value at all okay this is

2166
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:01,280
zero value all the way between those two

2167
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:05,840
lines

2168
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,840
but in the the empirical world

2169
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:12,800
even if the requirements never changed

2170
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,719
over the life of the project right of

2171
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,239
the life of the deliverable

2172
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,120
we're going to get to exactly the same

2173
01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:21,760
place but they're seeing

2174
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,000
value at the end of every iteration they

2175
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,719
would be able to deploy to production

2176
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,280
after a month if we had built something

2177
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,280
of value

2178
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,639
and then the next month they have more

2179
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,960
value the next month they have

2180
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:37,440
even more value they're amortizing that

2181
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:40,719
value over time

2182
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:43,199
rather than one lump thing at the end

2183
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:44,080
but what really happens the real super

2184
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:47,040
power

2185
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:49,199
of empirical process control systems is

2186
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:51,520
that

2187
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:52,880
we can change what we're working on at

2188
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,440
the end of every sprint remember we're

2189
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,840
maintaining that ability to change

2190
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:01,520
so maybe we get to the end of sprint

2191
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:04,320
two and everything after it

2192
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:05,920
is now invalid and we need to work on

2193
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,119
something different because the business

2194
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,159
has changed

2195
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:10,639
right think of every video conferencing

2196
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,440
product

2197
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:14,400
on the planet the minute lockdowns were

2198
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,600
announced

2199
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,480
what do you think happened to their

2200
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,480
product backlogs

2201
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,400
they changed yeah they changed and

2202
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,520
probably

2203
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,520
drastically whole shift in focus

2204
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,199
right probably a massive shift in focus

2205
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:31,360
towards performance

2206
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,320
first because they're like well we used

2207
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,239
to have

2208
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,520
x number of people and now we've got x

2209
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,040
times 10 every day

2210
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,719
okay we need to look at performance we

2211
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,639
need to look at sorting out those

2212
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,199
problems

2213
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:46,000
so what actually happens is at the end

2214
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,000
of every

2215
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:54,639
iteration we're able to do something

2216
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:59,440
more valuable than the things we thought

2217
01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:01,920
would be valuable and that's that value

2218
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,119
gap between where we thought we were

2219
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,199
trying to get to

2220
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:07,520
and where we really need to be in order

2221
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:10,320
to maximize the value to the customer

2222
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,000
think of one of the the the principles

2223
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:15,040
in the agile manifesto

2224
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:18,320
is maximizing the amount of work not

2225
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,000
done right don't do stuff you don't need

2226
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:23,679
to

2227
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:26,960
that's this gap here is we didn't do

2228
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:29,760
this work we did something better

2229
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:32,560
and that's how we get that super power

2230
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:39,840
of value delivery

2231
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:39,840
in an empirical process control system

2232
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,679
so any questions on that

2233
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,760
oh i got some stuff moving around i am

2234
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:56,400
going to

2235
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,400
lock that

2236
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,239
there we go i locked it i'm going to

2237
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,400
send everybody a pdf of

2238
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:07,840
of the the mural anyway at the end so

2239
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,840
you'll get a copy of it okay

2240
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:12,400
was that was that a good way to tell

2241
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:15,760
that story building up the

2242
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:19,440
pictures cool nope that's

2243
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,400
that's the the feedback i need so we are

2244
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:24,000
at four

2245
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,040
minutes over um so i'd i'd like you to

2246
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,920
think

2247
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:32,719
of um let me summon again

2248
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,199
i'd like you to think of something think

2249
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,560
of the

2250
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:39,119
what the difference between

2251
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,639
what we've been talking about and your

2252
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:44,159
world at work

2253
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:46,719
and how a move towards

2254
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:47,679
more empiricism right more empirical

2255
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:50,000
practices

2256
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:51,040
because it's a dial it's not a bullying

2257
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,280
thing it's not your

2258
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,159
have empiricism or you don't it's like

2259
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,320
this

2260
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:58,159
dial that goes from zero to i guess it

2261
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,840
goes to 11 doesn't it peter because all

2262
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:03,760
all good dials go to 11.

2263
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:07,119
um and

2264
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:10,719
um what could you

2265
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:15,040
do within your organization

2266
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:16,800
that doesn't need anybody else

2267
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:18,159
to give you something to do what can you

2268
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,560
do on your own

2269
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,600
right so that's without without

2270
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,800
additional

2271
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:27,040
authority or um

2272
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,920
from your organization additional powers

2273
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:30,960
what could you do

2274
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:34,880
inside of your organization to help make

2275
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,880
things a little bit more empirical

2276
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:47,280
just be one thing

2277
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:50,320
that that that boy scout rule

2278
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,480
right whenever you do something

2279
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:58,560
leave it a little bit better than you

2280
01:38:52,480 --> 01:39:00,560
found it

2281
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,920
how do you make things a little bit

2282
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,920
better

2283
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,080
it doesn't have to be a lot it can just

2284
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,080
be a little bit

2285
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:10,840
make your teams a little bit happier

2286
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:13,840
make it a little bit easier to do the

2287
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
work

2288
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:24,159
a couple people adding adding ideas

2289
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,159
it's always a good thing to do

2290
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,719
oh some people in the chat as well

2291
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:33,440
managing my own time

2292
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:36,880
to take on more value adding tasks yeah

2293
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:37,920
might stop doing things that are not

2294
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,119
valuable

2295
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:44,719
do more of things that are valuable

2296
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:47,040
right and that's we should all be

2297
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,239
continually looking at the activities we

2298
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,960
have to do

2299
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:52,480
in our in our work world and figuring

2300
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,719
out which ones are in the

2301
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:56,000
the poverty gap right what are we not

2302
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,639
doing enough of

2303
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,440
um or in the rigidity graph depth what

2304
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:00,800
are we stuck

2305
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,239
doing that we should really be doing

2306
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,239
less of because it's not valuable

2307
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,520
oh i'm sorry shelton shelton's saying

2308
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,760
he's he's shifting

2309
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:15,440
tracking work items on multiple projects

2310
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:18,719
in spreadsheets with operative

2311
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:20,960
deadlines all in a vacuum to using a

2312
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,239
backlog with all of my projects as

2313
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,520
different work streams so

2314
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:28,639
that's a lot of work right so that's

2315
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,480
good moving away from uh some of those

2316
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:34,239
old ways of doing it

2317
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:36,239
increasing um the

2318
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:38,320
more i guess more modern ways of doing

2319
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,800
things right we all need to continuously

2320
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:44,400
modernize the world has changed

2321
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,400
yeah code would change priorities

2322
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:52,000
so yeah lots of pain in teams when we're

2323
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,360
working the old ways so what have we got

2324
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,639
on our list

2325
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:59,760
uh managing time i added that one on um

2326
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:04,080
there sharpen the saw

2327
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:06,880
yeah maybe maybe some of your teams need

2328
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,679
practice honing their skills right maybe

2329
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,280
you do

2330
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:14,480
maybe you can hone sharpen your saw

2331
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:15,679
do work that matters be an example for

2332
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,440
others

2333
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,520
break down large tasks and getting

2334
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:21,760
feedback um

2335
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:23,119
get all the bas into one room i don't

2336
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,239
know what problem you've got that that

2337
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:26,719
will solve but

2338
01:41:24,239 --> 01:41:28,159
if it's going to solve a problem awesome

2339
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:29,679
i guess maybe they're disagreeing with

2340
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:32,960
each other

2341
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:34,159
coach to do more research and rapid

2342
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,800
prototyping

2343
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:37,600
to test a hypothesis before writing code

2344
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,000
yeah

2345
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,560
um writing code can sometimes be what

2346
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,360
you need to do to test a hypothesis

2347
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,560
right i usually say everything's an

2348
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,159
assumption

2349
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,320
until it gets into the hands of your

2350
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:53,440
users right

2351
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:55,520
so how much assumption risk

2352
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,520
right because assumptions are risk how

2353
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:58,960
much risk can you cope with before you

2354
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:03,119
get things in front of them

2355
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:05,520
that can be uh really really difficult

2356
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:07,199
so thank you for for for putting that uh

2357
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,920
those ideas in there

2358
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:11,119
um and hopefully you can make some

2359
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,920
changes

2360
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:14,560
to the things around you i added some

2361
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,520
some

2362
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,159
content some references at the bottom uh

2363
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,080
the link

2364
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:21,840
that i think is quite uh good is that a

2365
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,639
link to the new new product development

2366
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,639
game

2367
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,920
um i always like referring to that

2368
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,960
article um

2369
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,239
and it's definitely worth a read um also

2370
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,760
links to things like the

2371
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,679
the i think the scrum guides in there

2372
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,080
somewhere is it bottom left

2373
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:37,440
scrum guide um the kanban guide for

2374
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:38,880
scrum teams the evidence-based

2375
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,280
management guide

2376
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:44,000
is in there which i'll talk about more

2377
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:46,880
next session so the next session i have

2378
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,040
is in two weeks at the same time and

2379
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,960
it's like introduction to scrum

2380
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,960
well an introduction to agility so maybe

2381
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:56,000
this is a little bit of prep for

2382
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,760
uh some of those ideas there

2383
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,480
and i'll try and use as many of the same

2384
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,159
techniques maybe with better timing

2385
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:04,400
right that's that's always something

2386
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:07,760
that i try and uh work on

2387
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:09,840
um so what would be super cool oh i can

2388
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,159
see there's already some feedback

2389
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,760
preempted me

2390
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:15,360
look at that people are keen to give

2391
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:18,639
feedback um

2392
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:20,800
i am interested in i'm dragging things

2393
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:24,320
around

2394
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:27,360
um any uh feedback

2395
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:28,320
that you have so my good friend russell

2396
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:31,840
miller

2397
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:33,840
always says that feedback is a gift

2398
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,199
right i'd like you to give me the gift

2399
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,719
of feedback

2400
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:41,280
um what are um

2401
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:42,560
things that you think worked well uh

2402
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:46,239
what needs to change

2403
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:48,719
timing i'm already on that one um

2404
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:53,600
i think i i always have that problem so

2405
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:54,960
that's maybe a systemic martin thing um

2406
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,480
yep thank you what needs to change

2407
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,880
somebody's plonked time management on

2408
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:01,280
there

2409
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:07,679
i am i'm good with that uh

2410
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:10,400
what else do you like not like

2411
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,960
any topic so in the unanswered questions

2412
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,199
section

2413
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,760
maybe what other topics would you be

2414
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,760
interested in

2415
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:24,000
because really we can

2416
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:27,600
i am going to feed that back to um

2417
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:31,679
product team there yeah yeah uh

2418
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:35,440
so for for when i'm teaching classes

2419
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:37,840
and uh it's been pretty good

2420
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:38,480
right it's been it's been pretty it has

2421
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,760
been

2422
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:45,440
pretty good uh but for it here

2423
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:48,400
it's not been pretty good and i think

2424
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,040
part of that is in a free live webcast

2425
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,239
people

2426
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:54,159
sometimes drop in and out um and i think

2427
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,520
it confuses teams when people are

2428
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:57,040
dropping in and out

2429
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,239
and when you try and set up breakout

2430
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,600
rooms and it's trying to put people in

2431
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:00,719
breakout rooms but then they've already

2432
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,159
gone offline and

2433
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,600
i think it gets confused definitely

2434
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:07,280
there are other tools out there that do

2435
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:10,239
that a little bit better

2436
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,880
i am a microsoft weenie um so i'll

2437
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:12,560
probably

2438
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,560
i'll stick with it and just provide

2439
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,560
feedback for the team

2440
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,119
um and hopefully they can they can fix

2441
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:21,600
those issues

2442
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:22,800
