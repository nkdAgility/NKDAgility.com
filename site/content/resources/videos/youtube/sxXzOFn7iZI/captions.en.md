If you're hiring an agile coach, you need to consider that they're not just going to be coaching people. They're an agile coach, not just a professional coach. They're going to have to be able to mentor and teach people how to do particular processes, practices, or perhaps tools in the activities that you're doing. 

So, in order to become better at agile, you need a coach who is able to teach, engage, and inspire your teams and people to greatness.
