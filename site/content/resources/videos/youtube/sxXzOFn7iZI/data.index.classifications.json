    "reasoning": "The content focuses strictly on the human elements of Agile coaching—mentoring, teaching, and inspiring teams to adopt Agile practices. There is no explicit mention or exploration of human-AI collaboration, AI agents as team members, or any aspect of Collective Intelligence as defined. Some themes such as team alignment, autonomy, and continuous improvement are adjacent but presented solely in a human context. The intent is to support hiring decisions for Agile coaches, targeting practitioners and leaders, with no reference to AI involvement or socio-technical systems that balance human and AI strengths. The audience fit is reasonably aligned due to the Agile/DevOps context, but the content does not address or imply human-AI partnerships or distributed cognition with AI. The confidence score is very low due to near-absent category relevance.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on hiring and the human-side impact of Agile coaches, but it does not discuss human-AI collaboration or the emergence of collective intelligence. Its relevance to the 'Collective Intelligence' category is therefore minimal.",

    "reasoning": "The content discusses the qualities and impact of Agile coaches, focusing on their ability to teach, mentor, and inspire teams to adopt Agile methodologies. While it mentions themes like autonomy and continuous improvement, these are presented at a team transformation level for Agile practice rather than within the explicit context of Agentic Engineering. There is little or no direct reference to maximizing human or AI agency, DevOps-infused craft, observability, systemic feedback mechanisms, or ethical autonomy. The audience overlap is moderate, as Agile practitioners and those interested in organizational change may benefit, but the content is not targeting Agentic Engineering specifically. Depth and alignment are accordingly moderate: the content is thorough on Agile coaching but does not extend into deliberate design of agentic engineering environments or the integration of AI/automation as collaborators. Signal is fairly high due to relevant and focused content, though much of it is standard Agile coaching discourse, not directly addressing the philosophical or systemic focus of Agentic Engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This resource centers on hiring and leveraging Agile coaches, emphasizing teaching, mentoring, and inspiring Agile teams. It shows moderate overlap with Agentic Engineering concepts (like autonomy and continuous improvement), but lacks explicit or deep connections to system agency, DevOps craft, observability, or human–AI collaboration.",
