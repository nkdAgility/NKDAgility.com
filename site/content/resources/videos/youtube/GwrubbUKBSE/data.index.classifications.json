The alignment is minimal (0.5) because Agile and Scrum contexts can theoretically connect to OKRs, but the direct relevance to OKR frameworks is not explicit. Similarly, the intent is minimally aligned because its primary goal is general Q&A about DevOps and Agility, which could tangentially support OKR topics but does not explicitly mention or explore them.
