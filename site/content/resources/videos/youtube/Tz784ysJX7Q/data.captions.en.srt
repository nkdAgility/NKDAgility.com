1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,839
so one of the questions I often get is

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,120
how how do we potentially as delivery

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,120
managers how do we balance the

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,519
difference between speed and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,320
stability right when you're under

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,039
pressure for tight tight

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,600
deadlights and I'd assert that there's a

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,519
there's there's a fundamental problem

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,080
with the

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,560
question and that's that we're under

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,399
tight why are we under tight deadlines

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,520
we tend to be cuz let's be honest

13
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,480
most

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,800
deadlines

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,399
exist because people don't believe you

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,320
can meet them that's why a deadline this

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
this is the ridiculous thing about about

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,079
about

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,800
deadlines so there are some deadlines

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,920
which are they're not even real

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,079
deadlines that that are coming the

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,160
external deadlines right so let's say

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,840
you've got a a a a business you're

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
something within the context of let's

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,640
say a regulated thing something's

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,400
regulated by the government the

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,560
government brings in a new

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,119
rule and your software does not

29
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,360
currently comply with that rule and the

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,000
government says by this date if you

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
don't have compliance we're going to

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,040
start finding you x amount of money for

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:30,960
every day that you're not compliant

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,880
right that that for many businesses

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
they would decide that that's just an

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,640
absolute deadline but the reality is

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,000
that's not even an absolute deadline

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,759
either we can pay the fine right we can

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,159
pay the fine how much is it going to

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,759
cost to build a

41
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,240
feature how long is it going to

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,640
take and what are the

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,840
implications of trying to

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,399
push for that feature to come out faster

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,880
than we are able to deliver that feature

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,119
right

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,640
people are going to start tripping over

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,880
their feet if we start pushing them too

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,000
hard they're going to fall in their face

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,000
and if they fall in their face the

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,560
software is going to fall in its vase

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,920
what's the impact of that on our brand

53
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,560
and our business and is it worth the

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,000
fine normally the find's a lot smaller

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,680
than the cost implications of going too

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,800
fast

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,400
so longterm you're probably not wanting

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,239
to pay all those fines right but

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,720
shortterm

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,239
you need to build the feature in the

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,840
right way with the right capabilities um

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,319
with the right level of quality

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,920
otherwise you're going to start

64
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,519
eroding your customers's confidence in

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,319
your product you're going to start

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,360
eroding the the the the brand awareness

67
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,760
the your brand of your company this this

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,120
is not okay right it's not okay to ship

69
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,720
poor quality um unstable product under

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,440
any almost any circumstances the only

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
circumstance I can think

72
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,480
even even even so the circumstance I

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,480
think about is our company will go out

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,879
of business next week if we don't have

75
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
this feature I think that's totally

76
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,120
arbitrary but I've heard I've heard that

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,879
one but if we ship that feature and we

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,640
have that feature but it doesn't work

79
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,840
properly and it's buggy is that actually

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,120
going to help us right is that actually

81
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,120
going to help us stay in business I I I

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,879
would be jub as to as to that maybe we

83
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,400
can try and hide it a good example of of

84
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,000
that being successful is is zoom during

85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,000
the pandemic right they and they they

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,480
they succeeded I actually don't

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,599
understand why they didn't get more crap

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,439
for it but what they what they what they

89
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,720
did was when the pandemic happened and

90
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,560
everybody started working from home

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,080
their user base massively multiplied

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,599
right very very quickly massively

93
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,760
multiplied and what they found was that

94
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,840
they couldn't they just could their

95
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,079
systems could not support that number of

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,760
users but if you start capping users

97
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,000
right and saying to people no we can't

98
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,079
have another user on the system they're

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,239
going to go somewhere else they're going

100
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,200
to go to your competitors they're going

101
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,720
to go to teams they're going to go to

102
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,079
WebEx they're going to go to somebody

103
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,479
else so you don't want to do that right

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,440
good business practice is sorry what

105
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,000
good that's one of those could be either

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,199
way um moral and ethical business

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,720
practice would have you either cap the

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,680
number of users until you can um

109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,160
increase capacity and bring on bring on

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,160
more more people bring on more

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,400
capability right but Zoom chose a

112
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,199
different route they decided that

113
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,720
maintaining that user curve and

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,240
supporting it was more important so they

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,360
started

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,759
systematically building features more

117
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,720
quickly at lower quality they started

118
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,960
ignoring security concerns cuz security

119
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,520
is a lot of your cost right for building

120
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,320
stuff validating and checking so let's

121
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,280
not let's cut all of that and then we

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,800
can we can build more stuff and they

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,440
deliberately turned off

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,199
encryption so Zoom one of zoom's selling

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,160
points was end to endend encryption of

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:24,280
of Cs but into encryption adds about 40%

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,840
load I I'm just ballparking that I'm

128
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,800
sure there's all sorts of variations

129
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,520
there but 40% load so they can

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,240
immediately have 40% more users stable

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,120
on the system by turning off

132
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,800
encryption but they didn't want to turn

133
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,199
off encryption and tell their users they

134
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,680
were turning off encryption because that

135
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,759
was a huge selling point for the product

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,840
having encryption and what would

137
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,880
existing users do if they were told that

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,199
it was encrypted so there was a little

139
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,720
green light in the corner of zoom and it

140
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,960
was the encryption light and it would go

141
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
green uh when the communication was

142
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,080
encrypted they turned off the encryption

143
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,360
but they changed the code so the light

144
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,240
continued to be green right that's

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,560
that's that's a reduction in quality

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,039
that's a massive massive business risk

147
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,240
and they were caught and that had a

148
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,919
massive impact to to their brand

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,479
awareness and a massive impact to their

150
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,599
business there are still companies today

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,240
that have zoom blocked as a product

152
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,319
within their organizational Network that

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,520
they will not allow it to be used and

154
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,240
it's because of

155
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,720
that moral and ethical decision that was

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:34,319
made at senior levels of that

157
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:37,800
organization to to reduce quality reduce

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,759
stability of of features that users

159
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,039
expected to work effectively they did

160
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,440
they were even worse they kind of lied

161
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,639
it's kind of like the the Volkswagen

162
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,400
Scandal a little bit right and except I

163
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,639
don't think anybody died but

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,520
don't reduce

165
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,599
quality in order to ship features

166
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,120
quicker it has an impact and it has

167
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,479
because we're building complex systems

168
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,720
it often has an impact you're not

169
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,800
expecting it often pushes you into a

170
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,160
corner and you're then left with those

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,479
moral and ethical decisions and you have

172
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,240
to go a particular way one's going to

173
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,160
suck and one's going to be nefarious and

174
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,720
quite often we as humans pick the

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,199
nefarious one because it's easier

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,560
cheaper more manageable in order to do

177
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
that so how do you strike a balance

178
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,400
between speed and

179
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,319
stability stability is more important

180
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,879
than speed much much much more important

181
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,240
than speed stability and quality is much

182
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,199
more important to than speed pay the

183
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,159
fine if you have to pay the fine but do

184
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,159
things well and do things properly
