title: 'Balancing Speed and Stability: Why Quality Should Always Come First in Delivery Management'
short_title: Balancing Speed vs Quality in Delivery
description: Explores why prioritising quality and stability over speed in delivery management leads to better long-term outcomes, even when facing tight deadlines or external pressure.
tldr: Rushing to meet deadlines often leads to poor-quality products that can damage your brand and erode customer trust, so prioritising stability and quality is essential even if it means missing deadlines or incurring fines. The long-term costs of sacrificing quality far outweigh any short-term gains from speed, as seen in real-world cases like Zoom. Development managers should educate stakeholders about these risks and always choose quality over speed to protect both reputation and customer relationships.

One of the questions I often encounter as a delivery manager is how to balance speed and stability, especially when we're under pressure from tight deadlines. However, I would argue that there's a fundamental issue with the premise of this question: why are we under such tight deadlines in the first place? More often than not, these deadlines exist because stakeholders lack confidence in our ability to meet them. This is the absurdity of deadlines.

Let’s consider the nature of deadlines. Some deadlines are imposed by external factors, such as regulatory requirements. For instance, if a government introduces a new regulation that our software must comply with, we might face a deadline that seems absolute. However, even in these situations, we have options. We can choose to pay the fines for non-compliance rather than rush to deliver a feature that may not be ready. 

Here are a few key points to consider:

- **Assess the Real Cost**: What is the cost of building a feature quickly? What are the implications of pushing for speed? If we rush, we risk tripping over ourselves, leading to a product that could damage our brand and erode customer trust. 

- **Quality Over Speed**: It’s crucial to deliver features with the right capabilities and quality. Shipping a poor-quality product can have long-term repercussions that far outweigh any short-term gains from meeting a deadline. 

- **The Fine Dilemma**: While paying fines may seem undesirable, it’s often a more viable option than delivering a subpar product. The fines are typically much smaller than the potential costs associated with a failed product launch.

Reflecting on my experiences, I recall the case of Zoom during the pandemic. As their user base skyrocketed, they faced a critical decision: cap the number of users or scale up their infrastructure. They opted for the latter, prioritising user growth over quality. This led to significant compromises, including the disabling of encryption features, which had been a key selling point. 

This decision had dire consequences. Many organisations still block Zoom due to concerns over security and trust. It’s a stark reminder that reducing quality to ship features faster can backfire spectacularly. 

So, how do we strike a balance between speed and stability? 

1. **Prioritise Stability**: Stability is paramount. It’s far more important than speed. If you find yourself in a situation where you must choose, always opt for stability and quality.

2. **Make Ethical Choices**: Avoid the temptation to cut corners. The easier, cheaper path may lead to ethical dilemmas that can tarnish your brand and reputation.

3. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Educate your stakeholders about the implications of rushing projects. Help them understand that quality work takes time and that the long-term benefits of a stable product far outweigh the short-term gains of speed.

In conclusion, while the pressure to deliver quickly can be overwhelming, we must remember that the foundation of a successful product is built on stability and quality. If it means paying a fine or missing a deadline, so be it. Let’s commit to doing things well and properly, ensuring that we maintain the trust of our customers and the integrity of our brand.
