Oh, that's a great question. So the question is how does Scrum help leadership teams pick the most valuable work to focus on? And the answer is it doesn't. Scrum has absolutely nothing in it to help leaders pick the most valuable thing to work on. That is their job, not Scrum's job to figure out. 

Right, if you're in business and you're running an organisation, you're the one that needs to understand where and what to invest in based on your interpretation of the market demand. Scrum can't do that for you. Kanban can't do that for you. SAFe can't do that for you. Marisa SSADM was never able to do that for you. The leaders need to make that decision. They need to understand their business, understand their customers, understand this strategic direction, having a strategic direction that they want to go in, and figure out what are the things that we need. Not solutions, right? But what are the outcomes we're trying to achieve? What's the next outcome we want to achieve? And then Scrum will help you create teams of highly professional people who can organise around delivering that using Scrum.
