1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,639
oh that's a great question

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,280
so the question is how does scrum

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,160
help leadership teams pick the most

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,939
valuable work to focus on

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:25,800
and the answer is it doesn't

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,320
scrum has absolutely nothing in it

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,579
to help leaders pick the most valuable

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,760
thing to work on that is their job

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,160
not scrum's job to figure out

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,920
right if you're if you're in business

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,140
and you're running an organization

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,360
you're the one that needs to understand

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,440
where and what to invest in based on

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,719
your interpretation of the market demand

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,300
scrum can't do that for you

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,020
kanban can't do that for you

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,020
safe can't do that for you Marisa ssadm

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,059
was never able to do that for you

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,920
the leaders need to make that decision

20
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,380
they need to understand their business

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,659
understand their customers understand

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,640
this strategic Direction having a

23
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,100
strategic direction that they want to go

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,100
in and figure out what are the things

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,020
that we need not Solutions right but

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,479
what are the outcomes we're trying to

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:26,280
achieve what's the next outcome we want

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,799
to achieve and then scrum will help you

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,400
create

30
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:35,159
teams of Highly professional people who

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,119
can organize around delivering that

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,119
using scrum
