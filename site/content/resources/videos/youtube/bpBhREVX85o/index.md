# How does scrum help leadership teams pick the most valuable work to focus on?

In simple or complicated environments such as civil engineering, traditional #projectmanagement is a great answer. You know what needs to be done, you know who is best positioned to do the work, and you know how long that will take and how much it will cost to do.

Because it is complicated, it tends to be linear and stable, and so it's simply a matter of running a tight ship from point A to Z to ensure you get the job done efficiently and effectively.

In complex environments, things become way tougher. You have never built the solution or solved the problem before, and so you don't know what you don't know.

#agile is a process of developing a hypothesis, running an experiment, inspecting what has been created, and using the data and evidence to inform what you should do next.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how #scrum provides a framework to help #leadership teams decide which work is the most valuable, in the context of the customers they serve, and within the organizations constraints.
