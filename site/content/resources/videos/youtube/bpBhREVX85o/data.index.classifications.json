There is minimal reference to product developers as a role—the closest mentions are of 'product development teams' in a generic sense, not in context of modern Product Developer accountability or responsibilities. Key topics such as cross-functional skills, definition and purpose of the Product Developer, or clear behavioral responsibilities are missing. The main intent is educating leadership, not product developers specifically, and only tangentially references those who develop the product. Thus, relevance and confidence are low.",
