There are two main reasons to do the EPS class. The first one is getting started. You have a team that doesn't know Scrum, that wants to try some of the things in Scrum and needs to learn how it's done. The second one is tune up. Your team's maybe been doing Scrum for a number of years, maybe never had any formal training, and you're not sure whether we're actually doing Scrum or we're doing... are we focusing on the right things? Are we just making it up as we go along? Are we just doing waterfall? How do we know? How do we get back to roots? The APS is a great class to kind of level set and everybody in the group on what professional Scrum looks like. And then you can figure out how does that work within your organisational context.
