1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
there are two main reasons to do the EPS

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,780
class the first one is getting started

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,820
you have a team that doesn't know scrum

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,160
uh that once wants to try some of the

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,039
things in scrum and needs to learn how

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,740
how it's done and the second one is tune

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,320
up uh your team's maybe been doing scrum

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,500
for a number of years maybe never had

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,900
any formal training and you're not sure

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,119
whether we're actually doing scrum or

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,640
we're doing all are we focusing on the

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,079
right things do we are we just making it

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,360
up as we go along and we're just doing

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,420
waterfall how do we how do we know how

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,120
do we get back to roots and the aps is a

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,579
great class to kind of level set and

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,579
everybody in the group on what

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,200
professional scrum looks like and then

19
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,000
you can figure out how does that work

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,000
within your organizational context
