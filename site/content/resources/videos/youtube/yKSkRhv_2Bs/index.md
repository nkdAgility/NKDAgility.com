The APS (Agile Professional Scrum) course is necessary for any team looking to embrace the Scrum methodology, especially if you're starting your Scrum journey.

## Reason 1 - A Launchpad for Scrum Newbies

The very foundation of stepping into the Agile world is embarking on a journey of learning and adaptation.  🔑

"The first reason to do the APS class is getting started if you have a team that doesn't know Scrum, that wants to try some of the processes in Scrum, and needs to learn how it's done."

Yes, you heard it right!  🎯

It's the perfect kickstart for teams eager to absorb the essence of Scrum and integrate it into their workflows. 🚀

## Tuning Up Your Scrum Practices

Maybe you need an overhaul for Scrum veterans who want a refresher and to build on what they've already learned.

Perhaps your journey began a while back, but you find yourselves at a crossroads, unsure of your path.  🛠️

The second reason it is not uncommon for a team to attend an APS (Agile Professional Scrum) class could be simply for a tune-up.

Perhaps your team has been doing Scrum for a number of years and has never had any formal training, so you're not sure whether the team is actually doing Scrum or are all focusing on the right things.  🎯

Or are we just making it up as we go along, and the team is just doing Waterfall?"

## Rediscovering the Roots of Scrum

How do we navigate these murky waters?

It's high time we addressed the critical questions - How do we assess the team's understanding of Scrum?

How do we get back to the roots of Scrum? 🌱
