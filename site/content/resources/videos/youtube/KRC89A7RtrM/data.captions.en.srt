1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,280
so when you first open Team Foundation

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,840
server you might see a message saying

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,920
some features of Team web access are not

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
visible to

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,119
you and you click show details there's

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,720
an msdn article on how to to solve that

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
problem but it is actually very simple

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,359
to solve as long as you have uh your

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,720
administrator on the TFS server not just

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,080
on the collection but on the whole

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,679
server you can click on the little Cog

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,880
the top right to go in and administer

13
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,880
your

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,239
server and if you click all the way up

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,760
to control panel in the view there and

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,840
you'll see an access levels tab on

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,920
access levels and you get to configure

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,160
which users have permission or have

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,000
which licensing level so you have

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,120
limited access which is view my work

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,039
items and you do not need uh Cal or any

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,960
sort of access directly paid access TFS

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,920
in order to get this level um you have

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,360
standard which is currently the default

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,960
which is why we get the message to say

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,240
things aren't being shown this requires

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,320
a cal and so anybody in this

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,119
