### Actively Managing Your Workflow in a Kanban Strategy

**Introduction**

Once you have defined and visualized your workflow, the next critical step in a Kanban strategy is to actively manage the work within your workflow. This means being proactive and engaged with the process, ensuring that the flow of work remains smooth and efficient.



* * *

**The Importance of Active Management**

Active management is essential because it prevents you from being a passive observer of your workflow. It's not enough to simply visualize your work; you need to take action to optimize the process. Hereâ€™s how to effectively manage your workflow:

1. **Monitor Work in Progress (WIP)**:

- Adjust the amount of work in progress to ensure optimal flow.

- If there are too many tasks in a particular area, reduce the WIP to prevent bottlenecks.

- Conversely, if there are idle resources, increase the WIP to keep everyone productive.

1. **Prevent Piling Up of Work**:

- Keep an eye on your Kanban board to identify areas where work is piling up.

- Actively address these bottlenecks to prevent delays and maintain a steady flow.

* * *

**Identifying and Addressing Issues**

Active management involves regularly reviewing your workflow and addressing any issues that arise:

- **Aging Work Items**:

- Identify items that have been active for an unusually long time.

- Investigate why these items are stuck and take steps to move them towards completion.

- **Blocked Items**:

- Clearly indicate blocked items on your board.

- Develop strategies to unblock these items and get them moving through the system again.

- **Clogged Workflow**:

- Treat your workflow like a pipe that can get clogged.

- Actively work to remove any blockages to ensure a smooth flow of work.

* * *

**Taking Action**

Here are some specific actions you can take to actively manage your workflow:

- **Review and Adjust**:

- Regularly review your Kanban board and adjust WIP limits as necessary.

- Ensure that tasks are moving smoothly through each stage of the workflow.

- **Resolve Blockages**:

- Develop a process for quickly addressing and resolving blocked items.

- This might involve cross-functional collaboration or additional resources to clear the blockage.

- **Optimize Flow**:

- Continuously look for ways to optimize the flow of work.

- Use metrics and data from your Kanban board to make informed decisions about process improvements.

* * *
