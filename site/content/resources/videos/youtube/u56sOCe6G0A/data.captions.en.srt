1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,680
once you've defined and visualized your

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,360
workflow the next most important thing

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,599
you can do in a cand strategy is to

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,000
actively manage the work within your

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:19,359
workflow that means that you are not

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,240
just a bystander to the process right

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
the people that are participating in the

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,519
process are not just sitting there

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,720
looking at a piece of work going yeah

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,280
that's not working very well and not do

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:36,640
anything about it the the the the core

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,360
practice here is to actively manage that

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
means that if we're finding that we've

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,000
got too many things going on in a

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,000
particular area perhaps we should reduce

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,079
our work in process if we've got lots of

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,680
folks sitting about uh uh doing nothing

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,440
in a particular area because we don't

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,160
have enough work perhaps we should

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,480
increase the amount of work actively

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:05,040
manage your whip you want to

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,360
avoid uh uh work piling up anywhere in

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
your system so if you're if you're if

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
you're viewing if you've got your

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,439
visualization of your caman and you see

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,439
lots of things piling up before another

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,960
another group another team another H H

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,280
process right what are you going to do

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,280
about it you can't just sit there and

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,159
watch it pile up that's not going to

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,200
help us maximize the flow maximize the

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,920
the amount of value that we deliver we

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,840
need to do something about it we need to

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,000
go and figure out what the problem is we

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,520
need to change our system in order to

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,079
make it better um

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,159
so making sure we don't have stuff pile

38
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,320
up uh making sure something doesn't sit

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,680
there for ages that's part of actively

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,360
managing your work as so many teams that

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,479
I work with where we start looking at

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,240
this data and the first thing I'll say

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,560
is why is this thing been active for 250

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,719
days right and it's something that's

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,720
either fallen through the cracks or it's

46
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,720
some kind of bucket piece of work that

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,239
exists forever or it's just something

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,319
that's taken a really long time because

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,440
it's got blocked or we didn't understand

50
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,760
it or any of those

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,080
things why is it still sitting there how

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:29,959
can we make it go away how can we move

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,200
it towards completion I if we have a

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,560
history of things taking a long time

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,280
then we need to do something about that

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,560
if if items on your board are blocked

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,080
how are you visualizing and indicating

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
that they're blocked right that was the

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
first practice but what are you going to

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
do about it are you going to just going

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,760
to sit there and go yeah we've got all

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,040
this block stuff let's move on and work

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
on something else no no you need to

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,519
actively manage the blocked items how do

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,360
we unblock them how do we unstick them

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,599
how do we get them moving through the

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,480
system again it's it's kind of like

68
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,879
having having a pipe if the pipe gets

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
clogged right with whatever it is that's

70
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,519
clogging the pipe it's difficult for

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,599
other things to move around it because

72
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,159
our attention is is continuously pulled

73
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,640
in different directions so we want to

74
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,319
actively work to get rid of those

75
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,159
blockages right anything that's blocked

76
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,040
anything that's slow moving and getting

77
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,799
old sitting there and any thing uh that

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
is piling up right something that's

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,680
stuck and usually things pile up behind

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,760
blocked stuff right all of those things

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,760
are required for you to be actively

82
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,879
managing your work in a caman strategy

83
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,200
if you're struggling to implement a cban

84
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,720
strategy we can help or help you find
