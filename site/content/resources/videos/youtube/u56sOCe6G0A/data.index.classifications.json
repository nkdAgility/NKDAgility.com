    "reasoning": "The content provides a practical guide to active workflow management in Kanban, focusing on topics such as monitoring Work in Progress (WIP), identifying aging and blocked work items, preventing bottlenecks, and optimizing flow. However, there are no direct references to Service Level Expectation (SLE), its definition, calculation, application, or improvement as outlined in the category definition. None of the key SLE-related terminology (elapsed time range, probability, forecasting delivery, transparency for stakeholders, etc.) or authoritative sources are mentioned. The alignment and depth scores are low because, while concepts such as active management and workflow optimization are tangentially related to SLE as they support general Kanban maturity, the core topic—SLE as a time-based performance forecast—does not appear. The intended audience (Kanban practitioners) is somewhat aligned, but the signal-to-noise ratio is modest since the content is focused on general Kanban practices rather than the specifics of SLE. No penalties are applied as the content is not outdated nor does it contradict the category, but the lack of SLE-specific substance keeps all scores firmly in the low range. The confidence score is proportionate, reflecting a near-total absence of SLE relevance beyond implicit support for healthy flow.",

While 'value to customers' is mentioned in the conclusion, the discussion primarily orients around internal optimization and efficiency rather than explicit customer outcomes, feedback loops, or validated customer needs. The alignment is partial—the practices discussed could serve customer value if applied with that intent, but the text rarely links them to tangible customer measurement or feedback. The intent therefore does not fully match the strict requirements for 'Customer Focus' as defined. It is most aligned with process improvement for delivery teams, with only a peripheral nod to customer value in the wrap-up. There are no penalties, as the tone is neither outdated nor oppositional. Audience targeting is strong for practitioners or team leads, matching agile/DevOps contexts. Signal is high, but focus veers more towards process than explicit customer outcomes.",
