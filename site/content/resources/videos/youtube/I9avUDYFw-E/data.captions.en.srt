1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,279
it's critical that we start investing in

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,440
the competence of the people that we

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,639
have of hiring the right people of um

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,439
keeping the people that we have that are

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,840
competent in supporting them in

6
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:23,519
experimentation and learning and

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,320
figuring things out because without them

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,519
we're not going to be able to create uh

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,719
uh uh the value that we need we're not

10
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,320
going to be able to create um the the

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,600
the products that are going to lead to

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,200
us being successful the thing I always

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,160
think about was an epiphany of mine many

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,000
years ago and that's that unhappy sad

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,879
people don't build great products they

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,280
build mediocre

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
ones do you want to build mediocre

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,920
products if you want to build great

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,399
products you need to find great people

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,120
you need to find people that are happy

21
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,559
you need to create environments within

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,719
which you encourage people to be happy

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,000
you encourage them to learn you

24
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,600
encourage them to care about what it is

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,479
you're doing and the products that

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,600
you're building and the first part of

27
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,240
caring is self-care and self-caring

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,960
within the context of the work

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,159
environment means caring about your

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,520
knowledge and your capability and your

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,079
competence and doing something about it

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,479
just like if you care about your health

33
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:35,799
you eat well and you go to the gym

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,840
if you care about your competence you

35
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,759
learn and you

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,079
practice that's why it's so important

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,799
that we have this focus on competence

38
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:53,079
within organizations and stop hiring for

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,079
a lack of it
