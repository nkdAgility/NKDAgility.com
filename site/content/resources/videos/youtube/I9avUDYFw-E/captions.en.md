It's critical that we start investing in the competence of the people that we have, of hiring the right people, of keeping the people that we have that are competent, in supporting them in experimentation and learning and figuring things out. Because without them, we're not going to be able to create the value that we need. We're not going to be able to create the products that are going to lead to us being successful.

The thing I always think about was an epiphany of mine many years ago, and that's that unhappy, sad people don't build great products; they build mediocre ones. Do you want to build mediocre products? If you want to build great products, you need to find great people. You need to find people that are happy. You need to create environments within which you encourage people to be happy. You encourage them to learn. You encourage them to care about what it is you're doing and the products that you're building.

The first part of caring is self-care, and self-caring within the context of the work environment means caring about your knowledge and your capability and your competence and doing something about it. Just like if you care about your health, you eat well and you go to the gym. If you care about your competence, you learn and you practice. That's why it's so important that we have this focus on competence within organizations and stop hiring for a lack of it.
