    "description": "ðŸ’¡ Invest in People: Competence Is Key to Building Great Products ðŸš€\n\nIn this video, I talk about the crucial need to invest in the competence of the people in our organizations. Itâ€™s not just about hiring the right people, but also supporting the ones we already have, encouraging continuous learning, and fostering a culture of experimentation. Without investing in our teamsâ€™ capabilities, we wonâ€™t be able to create the kind of innovative products that lead to success.\n\nOne major realization I had years ago was that unhappy, unmotivated people donâ€™t build great productsâ€”they build mediocre ones. If you want to achieve greatness, you need happy, engaged, and knowledgeable people. That means creating environments where they feel valued and are encouraged to grow. Just like self-care in your personal life involves eating well and exercising, self-care in the workplace means continuously improving your skills and competence. Let's make sure we focus on building competence and stop hiring without it. ðŸ’ª\n\n(b) Chapters\n\n0:00 - The Importance of Competence in Organizations \n0:37 - Why Unhappy People Build Mediocre Products  \n1:01 - Creating Environments that Foster Happiness and Growth  \n1:30 - The Connection Between Self-Care and Competence\n1:51 - The Need to Prioritize Competence in Hiring and Development\n\nIs your organization focused on building the competence of your people?
