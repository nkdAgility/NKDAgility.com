# Why does this matter Why is it critical that we invest in competence now

ðŸ’¡ Invest in People: Competence Is Key to Building Great Products ðŸš€

In this video, I talk about the crucial need to invest in the competence of the people in our organizations. Itâ€™s not just about hiring the right people, but also supporting the ones we already have, encouraging continuous learning, and fostering a culture of experimentation. Without investing in our teamsâ€™ capabilities, we wonâ€™t be able to create the kind of innovative products that lead to success.

One major realization I had years ago was that unhappy, unmotivated people donâ€™t build great productsâ€”they build mediocre ones. If you want to achieve greatness, you need happy, engaged, and knowledgeable people. That means creating environments where they feel valued and are encouraged to grow. Just like self-care in your personal life involves eating well and exercising, self-care in the workplace means continuously improving your skills and competence. Let's make sure we focus on building competence and stop hiring without it. ðŸ’ª
