1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,740
the question is how is technology like

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,740
AI changing the world that we work in

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,760
and I think this we're kind of on the

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,500
cusp of one of one of those big uh

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,100
revolutionary rather than evolutionary

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,920
changes in the way way that we work

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,039
um AI isn't going to

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,039
um

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,579
do your job for you right but AI is a

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,840
very powerful tool as a sidekick or

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,360
co-pilot for you as uh somebody who's

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,559
doing doing things right

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,440
um for example I I use it quite a lot

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,780
when I want to come up with ideas on a

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,760
particular topic and I'll ask it to

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,620
generate some ideas on a particular

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,660
topic it will make the ideas and then

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm going to go write stuff around those

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,559
ideas but it makes me much more

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,340
effective I don't know if you've ever

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,400
sat and stared at a blank page for ages

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,799
trying to figure out how do I start or

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,720
you get to a bit of your your your your

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,659
thing that you're trying to talk about

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,700
and you're like ah ah how do I how do I

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,680
go from here and you can effectively

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,520
take what you've written so far feed it

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,080
into a chat GTP and see what might be

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,460
next and it will come up with something

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,560
for you and they may come up with

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,799
something that's crap right it's totally

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,780
uh totally might do that but then you

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,520
are still the author right you're still

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,159
the one in control it's just the

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,320
co-pilot making suggestions for you and

36
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,600
it hopefully will twig twig that that

37
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,500
memory or that that thing you want to

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,659
talk about

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,479
and I do find it particularly useful

40
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,540
once I've written something to say oh

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,759
and create me a lead for LinkedIn

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,880
for this for this for this post and it

43
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,540
will go create uh those those things for

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,520
you it's it's really quick to to get

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,039
started and do things so to tie that

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,060
back to that idea of how it will change

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,500
the way we work it it will make us

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,620
um more productive and more capable

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,239
right as an individual

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,040
who adopts some of these AI tools we

51
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,540
become more capable at our jobs we

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,480
become more productive at our jobs we're

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,640
able to do more things more quickly

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,760
um less wasted time right you should you

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,000
should never again have to uh copy stuff

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,140
from one spreadsheet to another or uh

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
create uh forms in in you know you want

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,480
to take a spreadsheet and you want to

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,640
analyze the data AI will will build the

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,400
the bits for you and then you can then

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,940
write your analysis around it all of

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,220
these productivity tools are going to

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:02,879
um mean that you as somebody who adopts

64
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,340
AI are going to be far more effective

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,260
um at your job than your colleagues who

66
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,840
do not

67
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,879
um so I would say adopt AI bring it into

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,379
the way you're working as soon as you

69
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,620
possibly can even if you're just

70
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:21,440
tinkering with it uh go go get a course

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,480
on uh prompt prompt engineering or uh

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,760
find some stuff content to absorb and

73
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,700
figure out how you might use this

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,940
technology in your job because it is

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,819
going to revolutionize uh the way we we

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,280
work and hopefully for organizations

77
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:41,220
that adopt it wholesale it's going to

78
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,519
revolutionize their ability to compete

79
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,680
in the markets that they compete in by

80
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,780
them being able to adapt to changing

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,180
changing demands of the market much more

82
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,239
quickly than their competitors this is a

83
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,760
tool it's going to help us enormously in

84
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,620
figuring stuff out and that's how it's

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,200
going to change the way that we work

86
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,760
it's going to change every Vestige of it

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,739
and get on board or be left behind
