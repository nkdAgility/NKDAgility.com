# What is the most valuable thing you have learned through training people?

The transition from #agile practitioner to #scrumtraining can be pretty tough.

It's one thing to grow your knowledge, skills, and capabilities in your sphere of #agile versus upskilling and empowering others to thrive in #scrum and #agile environments.

The transition from in-person training to live, online training courses has also brought interesting evolutions from standard delivery, and in it's own way created a richer, more empowering experience for course delegates.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the most valuable part of being a scrum trainer and what has had the greatest impact on his training and delivery as a professional scrum trainer.
