1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,660
so the question is what's the most

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,120
valuable thing

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,900
I've learned

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,900
training people

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,060
I think I think it's that

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,939
there's two there's two things that are

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,100
kind of related

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,840
one is no matter where you are in the

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,699
world everybody's got the same problems

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,980
when they're when they're implementing

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,320
agile when they're

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,059
um trying to do scrum when they're

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,899
trying to think about

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,879
the implications of empiricism and a

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,879
value focus on their organization

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,579
everybody runs into exactly the same

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,780
walls right everybody runs in Texas they

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,200
think their walls are unique but

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,739
everyone runs into the same walls but

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,739
the value that I find

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,219
for for for me is

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,580
I I love

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,360
the engagement that I get

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,340
in Multicultural

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,860
multi-time Zone

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,180
multi-country training events much more

27
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,280
than I do

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,640
from single

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,720
Country Events because I feel like

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,360
there's a little bit of echo chamber

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,200
in a single country event

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,720
that there aren't as many I different

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,180
ideas generated

34
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,180
I think it kind of demonstrates that

35
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,040
that value in globalization right that

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,380
you're you're you're teaching a class

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,840
and you've got

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,079
you know even even you've got you've got

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
five people from the US uh five people

40
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,939
from the UK and they're they're they're

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,799
bouncing off each other and then that

42
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,340
one student that's from Eastern Europe

43
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,720
right will say but what about this type

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,759
of thing oh

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,399
never thought of that right because it's

46
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,259
not even within their sphere of

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,759
experience

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,060
and

49
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,620
those those ideas coming in I think

50
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,200
helped me

51
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,200
I guess appreciate the diversity of of

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,520
of of cultures that but it also results

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,440
in better

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,780
training experience for the students

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,840
because they get more conversation more

56
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,700
topics more not disagreement

57
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,180
disagreements not the right word but

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,180
more ideas

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,780
coming in there

60
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,060
um

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,480
and for me that for me that's the most

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,480
valuable
