As soon as I’m able to resolve their problem or address their concern with a path forward, people get super enthusiastic.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>I love that about training, and I’m deeply grateful for my <strong>scrum practitioner</strong> and <strong>agile consulting</strong> experience that empowers me to help them through common and complex problems in their unique context.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Sometimes, when you are dealing with a single organization in a classroom, or even people from the same country, you get an echo chamber. People think that the problems they are experiencing are unique to their culture or organization, but as soon as we bring in delegates from around the world, everybody sees for themselves that these are universal issues.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>Witnessing that sets people at ease and allows them to breathe. A solution is at hand. The problem has been encountered before and it has been resolved. There’s light at the end of the training tunnel.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>People feed off the energy and experiences of others, from around the world, because they are receiving insight into challenges that they are likely to encounter. Receiving insights into how powerful scrum can be once you’ve worked through the teething issues in the environment.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>That’s the value of globalization.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph

universally popular <strong>agile framework</strong>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>It’s proven itself in a myriad of applications, industries, and geographies.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>The great thing about our digital, live delivery of scrum training is that people also get exposed to problems, challenges, and opportunities they would never have considered.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>A developer in Mumbai may be dealing with the challenges of remote work in multiple territories, across multiple teams, where the developer in Glasgow may never have encountered anything outside of working in a small, 6-person team.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>These shared experiences really bring home how powerful scrum can be, and how fit for purpose it is for product development despite an astonishing array of applications and territories.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<p>So, if you’re
