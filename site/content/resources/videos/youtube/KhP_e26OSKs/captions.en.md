One of the key issues I see in organisations is the great difficulty that product owners, especially new product owners, find in getting your stakeholders to turn up for your Sprint reviews. Right? And oftentimes it's hard, even if they do turn up, to get them to provide you with feedback. Right? You ask them for feedback and all you can hear is tumbleweeds rolling through the desert. Right? You're trying to engage them and they're just not getting there. 

And that's, to me, a marketing issue. They don't understand the value of what you're showing them. They're not emotionally engaged in what you're showing them. If they were emotionally engaged, they'd be desperate to sneak into that discussion and provide that feedback, provide you with more information. And that is part of marketing.
