1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,720
one of the the key issues I see in

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,759
organizations is the great difficulty

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,719
that product owners especially new

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,799
product owners find in getting your

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,720
stakeholders to turn up for your Sprint

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:21,039
reviews right and often times it's hard

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,720
even if they do turn up to get them to

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,000
provide you with feedback right you ask

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,480
them for feedback and all you can hear

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,199
is tumble weeds rolling through the

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,079
desert right you're trying to engage

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,680
them and they're just not getting there

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,960
and that's to me a marketing issue they

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,640
don't understand the value of what

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
you're showing them they're not

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,760
emotionally engaged in what you're

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
showing them if they were emotionally

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,800
engaged they'd be desperate to sneak

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,960
into that c that discussion and provide

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
that feedback provide you with more

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,239
information and that is part of

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,239
marketing
