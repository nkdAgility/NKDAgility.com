One of the recurring challenges I encounter in organisations is the struggle that product owners, particularly those who are new to the role, face in securing stakeholder attendance at Sprint reviews. It’s a common scenario: you’ve put in the effort, crafted a compelling presentation, and yet, when the time comes, the room feels more like a ghost town than a vibrant discussion space. Even when stakeholders do show up, getting meaningful feedback can feel like pulling teeth. You ask for their thoughts, and all you hear is the sound of tumbleweeds rolling through the desert.

This situation, in my experience, is fundamentally a marketing issue. The crux of the problem lies in the stakeholders’ lack of understanding of the value of what you’re presenting. If they were truly emotionally engaged with the work, they would be eager to dive into the discussion, share their insights, and provide you with the feedback you need to refine your product. So, how do we bridge this gap? Here are some strategies that I’ve found effective:

### 1. **Communicate the Value Early and Often**
   - **Set Expectations**: From the outset, clarify what stakeholders can expect from the Sprint reviews. Highlight the benefits of their participation and how their feedback directly influences the product’s success.
   - **Use Visuals**: People are often more engaged when they can see the product in action. Use demos, prototypes, or even mock-ups to illustrate your points. This makes the value tangible.

### 2. **Create a Safe Space for Feedback**
   - **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Foster an environment where stakeholders feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, even if they’re critical. Remind them that constructive feedback is essential for improvement.
   - **Ask Specific Questions**: Instead of a broad “What do you think?”, try asking targeted questions that guide them towards specific areas of the product. This can help spark more meaningful conversations.

### 3. **Engage Stakeholders Before the Review**
   - **Pre-Review Check-Ins**: Reach out to stakeholders before the Sprint review to discuss what will be presented. This can help them prepare their thoughts and feel more invested in the discussion.
   - **Share Progress Updates**: Regular updates can keep stakeholders informed and engaged. Use newsletters, emails, or even quick catch-up meetings to maintain interest.

### 4. **Highlight Success Stories**
   - **Showcase Impact**: Share examples of how previous feedback has led to tangible improvements in the product. This not only demonstrates the value of their input but also encourages them to participate in future discussions.

### 5. **Make It Personal**
   - **Connect on a Human Level**: Understand the individual motivations of your stakeholders. What are their goals? How does your product align with their objectives? Tailoring your approach to their interests can significantly increase engagement.

### Conclusion
In essence, the key to transforming your Sprint reviews from a lacklustre affair into a dynamic, engaging discussion lies in effective marketing. By ensuring that stakeholders understand the value of their participation and feel emotionally connected to the product, you can foster a culture of collaboration and feedback that ultimately leads to better outcomes. 

Remember, it’s not just about presenting your work; it’s about creating a narrative that resonates with your audience. When stakeholders feel invested, they won’t just attend your Sprint reviews—they’ll be eager to contribute, ensuring that your product evolves in the right direction.
