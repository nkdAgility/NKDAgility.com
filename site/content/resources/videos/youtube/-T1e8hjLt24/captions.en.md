A blog post that I read years ago started with the phrase, "If you're reading this, you're already in the top 10%." That's because there's only a small number of people that actually focus on continuous learning, that actually try new things all the time, that are actually reading up on different techniques and different topics. They don't have to be new; they can just be new to you. They can be older things that you're going and figuring out. 

"Crossing the Chasm" was written in the 80s, right? What are the things that you're reading? How do you enable yourself to be in the top 10%? Because that's how you maximise your chances of getting the best gigs, right? You need to be in the top 10%. If all you need to do to do that is read some blog posts every week, maybe a couple of books a month, that's not a high bar.
