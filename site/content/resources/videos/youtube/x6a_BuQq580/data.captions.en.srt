1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,759
there's a little bit of a a fear um of

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:10,040
uh in in incomplete migrations that

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,960
things won't be you won't have them

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,679
available when you move to the to the to

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,680
the cloud I I've done hundreds of

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,480
migrations using

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,680
Microsoft's uh import tool that actually

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:29,519
the the database import uh uh tool and I

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,560
have never had any data loss in any

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
context

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,079
whatsoever wasn't known about beforehand

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,960
there are certain things that don't work

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,000
in the cloud that you can do on Prem um

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,079
you can you can increase the database

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,960
attachment size on Prem um and that will

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,800
unfortunately um not be possible in the

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
cloud right because there's other people

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,840
on the system you're not just uh uh it's

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
not just your company so you're not the

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,079
ones just the only ones taking the

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,719
taking the hit for performance issues

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,240
for having attachments that are too big

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:08,479
or um build lists that are bigger than

24
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,720
normal um so there are some things but

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,840
upfront when you're planning the

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,200
migration uh we need to call those

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,479
things we need to cut them down we need

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,680
to figure out how to resolve those

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,880
things and Microsoft provide tooling to

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
help understand what those things are

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,360
what the impact is um and what we need

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,600
to do in order to make our environment

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:33,680
viable for moving up to to aure devops

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,840
um so the there's not really any such

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,119
thing of a as of a incomplete migration

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,520
within that context it will just work um

37
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:47,040
I've had migrations get stuck and then

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,920
we have to back off restore uh turn back

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
on right that's how you restore you turn

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,000
it back on turn back on TFS locally um

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,560
and then replan something because

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,719
something's gone wrong or something

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,520
needs to be done on Microsoft's end but

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,840
usually especially if it's a bigger

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,039
migration um you talk to Microsoft first

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,399
and they have a support team uh uh

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,759
available who know you're doing a

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,039
migration um and you can email them and

49
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,599
they'll go kick the environment or

50
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,720
figure out what the problem is at the

51
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,879
time so that you can continue um so in

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,440
incomplete migrations from that

53
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,200
perspective are not a big deal if you're

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,560
doing a ad hoc pce meal migration like

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,400
you're moving the bits and pieces that

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,720
you want to move um like would you just

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,040
want to move this team or this subset of

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,280
this team or this project or just this

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,120
data right um

60
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,280
then we will know upfront exactly what

61
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,360
you can and cannot do within the context

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,440
of that migration but it's not something

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
it's not something we can Define at this

64
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
point because it it's wholly dependent

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,159
upon your data the format of your data

66
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,519
what you want to move what you're okay

67
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,159
with losing right um and having

68
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,360
conversations around that so you'll know

69
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,360
upfront um so when it gets to migration

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,319
time uh there shouldn't be any surprises

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,319
at all
