1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,160
a good question so how can companies

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,719
derive a greater benefit from training

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,280
if they invest in a private course

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,119
rather than just sending people

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,460
piecemeal to public classes I I think

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,460
it's an interesting question and I think

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,519
it's because

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,619
um ultimately because you're able in the

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,920
context of that class to air your dirty

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,899
laundry a little bit more than than if

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,780
you go to a public class

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,079
um I always try and create a safe space

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,840
in public classes that people feel that

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,520
they're able to talk about things that

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,980
are happening in their company and

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,539
everybody else in the rooms going to you

17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,340
know kind of pretend they didn't hear it

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,559
afterwards type of thing so that we can

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,680
we can talk about things but you don't

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,960
feel as comfortable as perhaps you can

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,020
be within the boundaries of a single

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,879
organization and quite often and I've

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,500
had this with with certain private

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,380
classes where

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,320
um I I'm talking about

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,299
professional scrum and I'm talking about

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,360
continuous delivery to production and

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm talking about unit testing and I'm

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,159
talking about uh just all of those

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,860
things around around devops and agile

31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,900
and

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,380
there are people in the room that will

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,180
say we can't do that here because of XYZ

34
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,340
and what's very interesting is you'll

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,920
have somebody in the room that says well

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,299
actually on our team we are able to do

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,220
that

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,720
and say okay well why can this team do

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,340
that in your organization but these

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,720
teams believe they can't

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,400
right that can be an important

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
discussion to have because if somebody

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,360
can do it you can pretty much all do it

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
right

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,439
um the the that that so dirty laundry

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,299
that realization of the possible

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,220
through talking to other people in your

48
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,500
organization if everybody in the group

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,360
is on the same team it's also a little

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,219
bit different I've done agile leadership

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,160
classes with the whole leadership team

52
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,800
for uh for an organization and that

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,400
brings up interesting conversations and

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,200
quite often their conversations that the

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
participants believe they should have

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,640
they should have already had right why

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
do I need to come to this training to

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,640
have these conversations but that it's

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
that they weren't provoked right it's

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,260
comfortable to to not have those

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,000
conversations do the same thing that

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,620
we've always done

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,480
um you know running running on the

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,920
treadmill getting getting things done

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,780
but sometimes you need somebody to

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,660
provoke you into thinking differently

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,060
provoke you into thinking about how you

68
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,060
do things and I think that's the same is

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,680
true for for Consulting and training but

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
especially for private training there's

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,300
a lot of provoking and asking difficult

72
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,000
questions and maybe the questions they

73
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,099
don't want to answer right because in

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,840
not one thing to answer it they realize

75
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,780
they realize something about themselves

76
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,879
as well so that for me is the added

77
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,120
value to private classes is that there's

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,959
a lot more Candor then maybe there might

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,959
be in a public class

80
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,080
