# How can companies derive greater benefit from training by investing in a private training course?

In #scrumtraining, there are people who pursue certifications to open doors in future, whilst others are in pursuit of knowledge and skills that will help them become more effective in their role.

Certification matters because it validates your knowledge and skills, but if your primary goal is to help a team of individuals achieve collective goals and objectives, a more focused approach to training and skills acquisition is a better investment for your organization.

NKD Agility offer public training courses, which includes individuals from around the world acquiring the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in their role, but we also offer private training courses which serve as a hands-on workshop that empowers the team to thrive in their unique context.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explores the benefits of investing in a private training course for your organization.
