1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
every CTO knows the pain you're dealing

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,759
with technology that's years maybe

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,760
decades past its prime it's slow it's

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,840
expensive and every time you try to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,440
integrate something new you're wrestling

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,599
with layers of technical debt and

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,840
questionable

8
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,439
architecture so why don't organizations

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,039
just modernize why does this problem

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,600
persist because ripping out a legacy

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,720
system isn't just about swapping old

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,960
tech for new these systems are embedded

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
in how work gets done they're connected

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
to critical processes compliance

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
requirements and a patchwork of

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,760
integrations that were never designed to

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,440
play nicely with today's

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,760
expectations security a constant

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,840
nightmare

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,239
scalability forget it you're in a

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,800
situation where every change every

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,920
update every attempt to innovate is met

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,399
with friction at Naked Agility we don't

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,840
claim to solve this for you because no

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,760
one can just fix a system that's

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,760
entrenched

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,600
overnight but we do help you make sense

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,320
of the challenge we help you see the

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,040
full picture understand the tradeoffs

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,119
and practical paths forward whether

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
these are incremental improvements

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,240
strategic modernizations or shifting how

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,759
your organization manages its systems of

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,159
work if you're tired of pouring money

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
into a system that holds you back maybe

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,720
it's time to step back and look at the

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,479
bigger picture let's figure out the

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
right approach on your terms
