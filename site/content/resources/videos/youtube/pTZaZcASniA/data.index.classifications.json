The content focuses on legacy system modernisation, technical debt, compliance, integration, and management approaches. While it hints at evolving systems of work and modern practices, it never addresses key Agentic Software Delivery principles such as autonomous AI agents, human-in-the-loop design, contextual intelligence, AI-driven delivery practices, or feedback loops involving agents. The intent is helping leaders with legacy strategies, not integrating agentic delivery concepts. The audience overlaps somewhat, as both target technical/leadership roles, but topical alignment is weak.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is focused on legacy system modernisation strategies, not the integration of autonomous AI agents or agentic practices. Its fit to Agentic Software Delivery is low; substantial topic misalignment, with only basic audience relevance.",
