1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,140
the most common thing I hear in a pspo

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,120
course

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,700
um is from

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,800
um from the product owners saying

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,139
um but but we don't have that kind of

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,700
control we we aren't able to change the

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,619
order of the product backlog we aren't

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,380
able to influence the product goal we

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,699
aren't able to uh discuss with the

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,859
business about the Strategic direction

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,560
of the product right that they just

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,560
aren't playing at that level

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,019
um and for me that's that's always an

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,480
invitation right if you're you're not

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,920
playing at that level but you realize

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,440
that you're supposed to be playing at

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,360
that level what can you do within your

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,100
organization to start playing at that

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,739
level what are the meetings you can

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,960
invite yourself to the conversations you

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,700
can have with other people to

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,180
demonstrate your knowledge and

23
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,700
capability because in order to get

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,239
accountability you have to demonstrate

25
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,239
competence
