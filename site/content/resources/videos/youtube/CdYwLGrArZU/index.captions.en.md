The most common thing I hear in a PSPO course is from the product owners saying, "But we don't have that kind of control. We aren't able to change the order of the product backlog. We aren't able to influence the product goal. We aren't able to discuss with the business about the strategic direction of the product." Right? They just aren't playing at that level.

And for me, that's always an invitation. Right? If you're not playing at that level but you realise that you're supposed to be playing at that level, what can you do within your organisation to start playing at that level? What are the meetings you can invite yourself to? The conversations you can have with other people to demonstrate your knowledge and capability? Because in order to get accountability, you have to demonstrate competence.
