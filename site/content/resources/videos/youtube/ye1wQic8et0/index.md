In the world of agile methodologies, one question that often arises is whether removing committees can significantly reduce time to market. Some claim that this can lead to a reduction of up to 50%. But is that really true? My experience suggests that while the figure may be exaggerated, the impact of committees on decision-making and agility is profound.

### The Myth of the 50% Reduction

Let’s be honest: the idea that you can cut time to market by half simply by eliminating committees sounds a bit too good to be true. As the saying goes, “Lies, damn lies, and statistics.” The reality is that while the exact percentage may be questionable, the detrimental effects of committees on decision-making are very real.

### The Problem with Committees

In my current engagements, I’ve observed that both formal and informal committees often slow down the decision-making process. Here’s how:

- **Decision Delays**: When a decision is needed, it often requires the input of multiple stakeholders. This can lead to lengthy discussions, disagreements, and the need to involve even more people. The result? Prolonged decision-making that stalls progress.
  
- **Stalled Teams**: While committees deliberate, teams are left waiting. This not only affects morale but also impacts deadlines. Teams need clarity to move forward, and when they’re held up by committee processes, they can’t deliver value.

### A Real-World Example

Let me share a specific example from a recent engagement. We were tasked with creating new procedures and policies to support a new way of working. The team on the ground wanted to use modern document management systems like SharePoint or Google Docs for collaboration. This would allow for quick feedback and iterative improvements.

However, the committee insisted on a more traditional approach: sending a final draft for review to a long list of stakeholders, who would then provide feedback through a cumbersome process involving Excel sheets. This not only delayed the project but also stifled innovation and responsiveness.

### The Cost of Traditional Practices

The difference between these two approaches is stark. With modern collaboration tools, we could have produced a near-final document in a matter of days. Instead, we faced a drawn-out process that could take six to twelve weeks. This is where the real cost lies—not just in time to market, but in lost opportunities.

- **Missed Opportunities**: Every moment spent in committee is a moment where potential business opportunities slip away. If decisions are delayed, competitors can swoop in and capture the market share that could have been yours.

- **Agility vs. Staging**: Committees represent a traditional, staged approach to management that is at odds with the agile mindset. Agile is about collaboration, speed, and adaptability. Committees, on the other hand, create barriers that hinder these principles.

### The Need for Change

It’s clear to me that committees need to be re-evaluated in the context of modern business practices. The agility of a team can be severely compromised by outdated decision-making structures. 

- **Empower Teams**: Instead of relying on committees, organisations should empower teams to make decisions. This not only speeds up processes but also fosters a culture of accountability and innovation.

- **Adapt to Change**: In today’s fast-paced environment, the ability to adapt quickly is crucial. Companies that cling to traditional practices risk falling behind more agile competitors.

### Conclusion

While the claim that removing committees can reduce time to market by 50% may be an exaggeration, the underlying truth is undeniable: committees slow down decision-making and hinder agility. The real question is, how many opportunities are you willing to let slip away while waiting for a committee to make a decision? 

If you’re in a traditional organisation, consider how you can streamline your processes and empower your teams. The future of your business may depend on it.
