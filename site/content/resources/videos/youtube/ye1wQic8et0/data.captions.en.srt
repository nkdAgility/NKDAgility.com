1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,900
so the question is

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,780
it's said that you can reduce time to

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,199
Market by up to 50 simply by removing

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,940
committees true or false and why

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,820
um

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,180
I would say that the 50 is probably

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,699
false right somebody's just made up you

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,359
know it was it it lies damn lies in

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,160
statistics right or or was it um 99.32

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,620
of all statistics are made up on the

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,680
spot right kind of thing

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,480
um but but

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,520
committees and I'm seeing that in

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,579
engagements I'm currently in

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
that the Committees of people being

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,320
brought together whether formal or

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,680
informal committees right

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,660
um to to make decisions result in those

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,219
decisions taking long

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,020
it results in those decisions taking

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,460
longer you know we need to make a

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,059
decision

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,239
uh we need to decide that I don't know

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,239
um

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,479
decision right but we need to be a bad

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,040
decision and

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,880
um all right in order to make this

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,040
decision

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,260
you know we need we need Bob and we need

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,500
Allison and we need Jamie and we need

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,479
Roberta and you know we need Maria we

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,220
need all these people together in order

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
to make this decision and suddenly

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,880
you've got disagreement and they're

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,320
pulling in other people

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,400
sometimes you just need to make a

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,140
decision

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,060
right and if it's the wrong decision

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,460
we'll fix it later

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,119
but we need to move forward because

41
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,619
while they're collaborating on this

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,780
um you've got a bunch of people sitting

43
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,939
about not doing anything because the

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,860
team is sitting there waiting for the

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,840
decision to be made so that they can do

46
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,159
the work and they have their deadlines

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,259
as well

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,920
um what oh I just I've just thought of a

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,360
a kind of generic but specific example

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,020
um from an engagement I'm working at the

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,140
moment

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,180
is that there's there's quite a lot of

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,580
um procedures and policies that need to

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,020
be created more rules right the

55
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,099
procedures and policies need to be

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,959
amended created or or adopted for a new

57
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,640
way of working

58
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,500
and what

59
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,180
one group of people would like to do the

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,440
people doing the work right the people

61
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,599
doing the work on the bottom would like

62
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,660
to be able to do is they'd like to be

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,099
able to just use a document management

64
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,900
system like uh SharePoint or Google Docs

65
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,120
right put the dock in there

66
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,520
and then send a link to the people that

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,739
need to collaborate on this Dot and then

68
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,560
they can come in on that link and add

69
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,480
comments and collaborate and make sure

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,920
you know make the little changes that we

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,080
can then accept using the review

72
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,760
functionality of these documents you

73
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,500
know modern document management

74
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,120
techniques

75
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,160
but the people on the other side were

76
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,019
like no no no no no no we're not we're

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
we we don't work that way we're not

78
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,239
going to do it that way

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,640
you send us your final draft

80
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,400
for the document

81
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,440
and then we'll take it off we'll go

82
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,420
around all of the people that in our

83
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,980
organization right and you don't know

84
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,200
how many that is that could be hundreds

85
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,720
of people need to will be emailed this

86
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,400
document and have their input and then

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,459
we'll have a group of people who

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
maintain an Excel sheet with a list of

89
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,900
all the changes and issues

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
in the document and then we'll give you

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,680
that back and you can you can you can

92
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,959
make your change

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,080
first way modern document management

94
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,360
techniques was specifically designed and

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,680
developed to solve this problem

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,120
right

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,920
but they don't want to do that so that's

98
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,780
a policy and procedure or a way of

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,700
working that is getting in the getting

100
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,980
in the way that committee is getting the

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,500
way of delivering value and I would say

102
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,980
in that circumstance it's way more than

103
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,879
50 uh of the of the of the time to

104
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,220
Market is is is increased by having by

105
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,680
removing that capability right you could

106
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,500
have a quick collaboration on a document

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,780
and in a couple of days of a little bit

108
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,599
of back and forth on this this document

109
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,879
come out with something that that is 99

110
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,340
of the way there

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,799
um or we can spend six to twelve weeks

112
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,320
going around with this other other way

113
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,440
of working where it's more we do our bet

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,960
we hand off to you you then do your bit

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,699
you hand that back we make the changes

116
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,440
and then hand it back to you and then

117
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,380
you do your bit right that's that

118
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,460
difference between collaborative and

119
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,520
agile

120
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,400
and staging in traditional

121
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,840
right so I think um committees are part

122
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,580
of that story committees are part of

123
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,080
that staging traditional management

124
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,840
practices

125
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
um and they really really they need they

126
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,100
need to go as a concept

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
um committees and steering and all of

128
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,800
these kind of things

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,360
um so yeah I fully think that 50 is not

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,580
unreasonable

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,320
but I think it's definitely under

132
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,340
selling

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,680
um the effects or the impact of

134
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,199
um or committees on your ability to get

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,300
decisions made and take advantage of

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,220
business opportunities right think think

137
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,440
about all of those business

138
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,259
opportunities that are floating by that

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,580
if you just had a team that was able to

140
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,340
take advantage of that business

141
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,500
opportunity but you can't because the

142
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,380
documents tied up in committee

143
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,020
how much money how much additional

144
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,880
capability not just time to Market but

145
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,860
how much how

146
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,979
forget time to Market how many

147
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,380
opportunities does your business lose

148
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:47,340
out on

149
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,639
Because by the time the decision is made

150
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,000
it's no longer no longer an option

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,039
or your competitors got there

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,320
and especially if you're a big

153
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,720
traditional bricks and mortar

154
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,699
organization like I mentioned Royal Bank

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,320
of Scotland before right like the Royal

156
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:10,259
Bank of Scotland uh and you're having to

157
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:15,000
compete with the likes of monzo right

158
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,680
small Nimble Tech in Tech based

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,780
organization that's able to move a lot

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,639
faster they don't even have to move a

161
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,620
whole hell of a lot faster they just

162
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,479
have to move faster than you

163
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,880
right that's all they have to move

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,259
faster than than to build a market for

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
themselves and start stealing your

166
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,180
customers has just move back and you
