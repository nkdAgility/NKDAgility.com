# Would you recommend a team APS workshop or an agile consultant?

If a #scrummaster is battling to organize the team effectively and align them with customer and organizational objectives throughout the #productdevelopment process, what should you do?

What do you do if the team simply don't get #scrum or don't understand why they need to shift from traditional #projectmanagement to #agile in order to be more effective as a #productdevelopment team?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of the APS (Applying Professional Scrum) workshop, combined with #agileconsulting to really help the team get traction and master the key elements of #scrum.
