1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,840
oh so if a scrum master was battling

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,599
with their team

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,880
would you recommend an APS Workshop or

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,220
an agile consultant

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,619
I may recommend a new scrum Master right

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,420
because if the scrum Master is battling

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,820
with the team that doesn't even make

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,000
sense they're there to help the team be

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,279
effective they're part of the team

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,140
um if a whole team is battling with them

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,620
that then that makes them the [ __ ]

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,120
right I think I think it does

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,340
um I guess it would be circumstantial

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,620
but that's how I feel

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,059
um

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,739
with an APS Workshop or an agile

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,000
consultant be better

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:51,300
what I tend to do as an agile consultant

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,600
is is more of a coach the coach right so

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm I'm happy to be there observe the

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
team

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,820
maybe give the whole team advice if

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,820
that's what's asked for

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,619
um but I would tend to focus on

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,600
um observing and then coaching the scrum

26
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,340
master and if the scrum Master is

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,860
battling the team maybe that's not going

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,760
to be effective right

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,479
um

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,600
so probably it depends what the scrum

31
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,119
Master is battling the team over so if

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,720
the scum Master is battling the team

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,240
um

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,460
like the team I I we we

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,220
the team are objecting to doing things

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,259
that could potentially benefit them it's

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,380
kind of let the team decide it's it's

38
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,920
meant to be a democracy democratized

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,680
process not a dictatorship so the scrum

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Master can't dictate anything but

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,820
perhaps there's some value in helping

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,040
the team understand

43
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:56,640
more about what

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,220
scrum for example has to offer

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,780
so that they have more ammunition to

46
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,280
make a determination and perhaps they'll

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,439
make a different determination right

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,399
because if the team decides not to do

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,619
scrum

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,200
they probably shouldn't be doing scrum

51
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,459
right because if you enforce it they're

52
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,780
not going to like it they're going to

53
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,819
push back against it and you're not

54
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,920
going to have a good time it needs to be

55
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,340
a a a a

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:25,620
um a chosen thing so so what what I

57
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,959
might suggest is yes an APS workshop and

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,900
treat it as a workshop treat it as

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,819
having having fun right from their

60
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,360
perspective

61
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,140
um but also from from from my

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:43,140
perspective they're all going to bring

63
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,120
the things the reasons why scrum can't

64
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,239
work for them

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,340
so it's almost like a hybrid that would

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,260
for me would be a hybrid situation where

67
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm going to run an APS where I may run

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,800
an APS Workshop

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,440
but I'm going to treat it very much as a

70
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,540
Consulting gig that they do want some

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,120
answers right they don't necessarily

72
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,040
just want to understand APS they want to

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,200
understand EPS within the context of

74
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,959
their company and their problems and

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,739
their issues because there's no point in

76
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,500
just teaching them scrum if they're

77
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,120
vehemently opposed to the idea of

78
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,519
anything anything like that or anything

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,780
being imposed upon them so

80
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,940
um probably approach it from that

81
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,580
perspective that that we're going to use

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,099
we're going to use the aps curriculum as

83
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,680
a way to shape the conversation and hit

84
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,800
all of the things that we need to hit

85
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,140
but even at the end at the end of the

86
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,239
aps I've mentioned this a couple of

87
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,659
times because I I just love this this

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,000
feature of the aps is after we've had

89
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,220
those conversations right whether it's a

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,260
standard APS where I've got a bunch of

91
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,239
public students and we teach the class

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,760
they learn a bunch of stuff about scrum

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,580
but we don't necessarily dive too much

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,400
into their individual context or if it's

95
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,920
a a private gig like the one that we're

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,840
describing here where we're able to

97
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,239
spend as much time as we need on their

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,099
stuff as well and understanding that

99
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,500
link because it matters to everybody in

100
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,760
the room at the end of the class we have

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,540
this we have this this session where

102
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,100
um we dive into what should you do right

103
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,080
there's there's a number of little

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,660
workshops

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,520
um that I can run with the group that's

106
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,100
in the room that depends on what the

107
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,160
group is and one of those is a kind of

108
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,800
getting started with scrum Workshop

109
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,360
um one of those is a a tune-up right

110
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,040
we're already doing scrum and we need to

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,120
tune up our process what should we look

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,880
at

113
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,340
um but we also first have a a kind of

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
set of questions to set them up and one

115
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,100
of those is should we use scrum

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,500
right and one of the questions is

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,199
what are the reasons we shouldn't use

118
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,540
scrum what are the reasons we should

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,620
what will happen if we don't change what

120
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,880
we're doing

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,919
because those are important questions

122
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,020
not for me to answer but for them to

123
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,120
answer for themselves

124
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,759
do they feel their current way of

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,340
working is actually working is actually

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,840
providing value to the customer if if if

127
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,460
not

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,040
what are they going to do to change

129
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,720
we've just talked for for four half days

130
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,060
about a bunch of tools that they could

131
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,199
use to help them change

132
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,280
are they going to try some of those

133
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,960
tools or do you want to try something

134
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,520
else if you think those tools won't work

135
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,139
what needs to change in your

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,560
organization in order for that to be

137
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,080
effective and I think uh that's probably

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,620
probably the way I would approach it a

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,620
kinda hybrids

140
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,259
APS with some agile Consulting in order

141
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,900
to help the team make better decisions

142
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,340
and you know when to I need to have a

143
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,460
long chat with the scrum Master if

144
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,919
they're battling the team right
