# Shift Left: Building Quality and Security From the Start

Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood, and today I want to explore the concept of "shifting left" in modern software engineering—a principle that’s all about building quality, security, and reliability into your software from the very start. It’s a transformative approach that not only enhances your product but also revolutionizes how your team works. Let me share some insights, personal experiences, and practical advice to help you embrace this mindset.

---

## **What Does “Shift Left” Mean?**

At its core, shifting left means moving quality assurance (QA) earlier in the development cycle. Instead of testing quality or fixing security issues after the code is written—or worse, after it’s in production—you build it into your processes right from the beginning. 

### **Why Shift Left?**
- **Prevent, don’t patch:** Catching issues early is exponentially cheaper than fixing them later.
- **Empower teams:** The same people who write the code should test, validate, and even support it in production.
- **Avoid brand damage:** By building robust systems, you reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures that harm your reputation.

---

## **How Far Left Should You Go?**

This is a common question—and a point of debate. For me, it’s simple: shift *all the way* to the left. Here’s what that looks like in practice:

### **1. Developers Own the Process**
- **Write and run tests:** The people writing the code should also write and run the tests, taking full accountability.
- **Support in production:** Teams that build features should also be responsible for maintaining and supporting them in production.

### **2. Integrated Expertise**
Modern teams need more than just coders:
- **Security specialists:** To identify and mitigate risks early.
- **Testing and validation experts:** To ensure the software does what it’s supposed to.
- **UX professionals:** To design intuitive, user-friendly experiences.

## **The Tools and Techniques That Enable Shifting Left**

Adopting a shift-left mindset requires leveraging modern engineering practices. Here are a few tools and techniques I’ve seen deliver incredible results:

### **1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
TDD isn’t just about writing better code—it’s about creating better architectures. By writing tests first:
- You focus only on the features you need.
- Future enhancements become easier to add.

### **2. Pair Programming**
While it may seem less productive at first (two developers working on the same code), it:
- Reduces errors early on.
- Saves countless hours of debugging later.

### **3. Continuous Feedback Loops**
Short feedback loops help teams:
- Identify and fix issues faster.
- Reduce the chances of problems reaching production.

## **Overcoming the Initial Pain**

I won’t sugarcoat it—shifting left takes effort. The first time you implement these practices, things will seem slower. You might feel like you’re delivering less. But here’s the reality:

- **Long-term efficiency:** Each task done “right” the first time means fewer bugs, fewer reworks, and less wasted effort down the line.
- **Reduced exponential costs:** Poor engineering practices don’t just create linear problems—they create exponential ones. Imagine building a skyscraper on shaky foundations. With software, at least, we can go back and strengthen those foundations. But wouldn’t it be better to build it right the first time?

## **A Real-World Example: Azure DevOps’ Transformation**

The Azure DevOps team is a perfect case study in the power of shifting left. Here’s their story:

- **The challenge:** Moving from a waterfall model to continuous delivery meant dealing with years of accumulated technical debt.
- **The investment:** It took four years to pay back that debt. But the results? Stunning.
- **The results:** 
  - They went from delivering 25 features per year to nearly 150 features—with the same team size.
  - Faster delivery cycles enabled more experiments, better customer feedback, and ultimately, a better product.

The lesson? The initial cost of shifting left is irrelevant compared to the long-term value it delivers.

## **The Building Analogy: Why Quality Matters**

Let me share a simple analogy: Imagine constructing a building. If the first floor is made of substandard materials, every subsequent floor is at risk. In software, poor-quality foundations might not cause an immediate collapse, but they create an unstable system that limits your ability to innovate. 

Unlike physical buildings, though, software gives us the unique opportunity to refactor and strengthen foundations as we go. By using techniques like TDD and continuous delivery, you can ensure that every new "floor" of your product is stable and ready for future growth.

## **Shifting Left Enables Engineering Excellence**

When you embrace shift-left practices, you’re not just improving your product—you’re transforming your organization. Here’s how:

- **Better products:** Quality and security are baked in from the start, reducing the chances of costly errors.
- **Happier customers:** Faster feedback loops and iterative improvements lead to better experiences.
- **Stronger teams:** Empowered teams with diverse expertise are more engaged and productive.
