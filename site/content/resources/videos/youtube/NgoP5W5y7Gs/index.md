 # Shifting Left for Security: Building Resilient Software from the Start | Martin Hinshelwood  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I tackle one of the biggest mistakes in software development: treating security as an afterthought. From costly last-minute fixes to systemic vulnerabilities, leaving security checks until the end of the process is a recipe for disaster. Instead, Iâ€™ll show you how to **shift left**, bringing security practices closer to your developers to bake it into your product from day one.

**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  
1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: The Problem with Late-Stage Security  
2. 03:15 â€“ What Does Shifting Left Mean for Security?  
3. 06:30 â€“ Lessons from Azure DevOps: Red and Blue Team Exercises  
4. 10:00 â€“ Security by Design: Building It In, Not Testing It In  
5. 13:30 â€“ Tools to Enable Shift Left: SonarQube, GitHub, and Azure DevOps  
6. 17:45 â€“ Why Security is Everyoneâ€™s Responsibility  
7. 20:00 â€“ Practical Steps to Prevent Vulnerabilities  

**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  
- Developers and engineers responsible for building secure software  
- Security teams looking to integrate best practices early in the development cycle  
- Product managers and business leaders focused on reducing risk and avoiding costly breaches  
- Organizations aiming to adopt modern, secure engineering practices  

**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  
- The risks of leaving security validation to the end of your process  
- How to shift security left and empower your development teams  
- Why security is a shared responsibility across all team members  
- Real-world insights from Azure DevOpsâ€™ red-blue team exercises  
- Tools like SonarQube, GitHub Advanced Security, and Azure DevOps for proactive vulnerability management  
- Strategies for preventing vulnerabilities, from code analysis to removing sensitive data from dev machines  

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  
- Shifting left reduces vulnerabilities by embedding security into the development process.  
- Late-stage fixes are expensive, risky, and often ineffective against skilled hackers.  
- Tools and practices like static code analysis and secure CI/CD pipelines empower teams to prevent issues before they happen.  
- Security is not just a task for a dedicated teamâ€”itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s responsibility.
