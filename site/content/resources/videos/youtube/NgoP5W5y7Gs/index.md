Shifting Left: Making Security Everyone’s Responsibility
Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood, and today I want to talk about something crucial: security by design. Far too many organizations treat security as an afterthought, running validation checks only at the end of development. This reactive approach leaves systems vulnerable, leads to costly fixes, and increases the risk of breaches.
The solution? Shift left. Move security processes as close to the engineers and developers as possible, integrating security into the development process from the start. Let’s explore why this matters and how you can make security everyone’s responsibility.
________________________________________
The Problem with Security as an Afterthought
For many companies, the traditional approach to security looks something like this:
•	Months or even years of work go into building a product.
•	At the end, security checks (e.g., penetration testing) reveal vulnerabilities.
•	Fixing these issues often requires rearchitecting significant parts of the system—something most teams don’t have the time or budget to do.
What happens next? Teams resort to quick fixes like superglue and duct tape to patch vulnerabilities. But hackers are incredibly skilled at peeling away those patches to exploit underlying flaws.
________________________________________
Why Hackers Always Win
In exercises like the red-blue simulations at Azure DevOps, professional "red teams" (hackers) consistently find ways to breach systems:
•	Red Team: Simulates attackers, identifying weaknesses and breaking into systems.
•	Blue Team: Detects and mitigates breaches.
Here’s the sobering truth: the red team always wins. If there’s a vulnerability, attackers will eventually find it. The only way to prevent these breaches is to ensure vulnerabilities don’t exist in the first place.

Shifting Left: Security as a Team Responsibility
To eliminate vulnerabilities, you need to integrate security into the development process from the start. This means:
•	Building security in, not testing it in.
•	Empowering developers with the tools and knowledge to write secure code.
•	Treating security as every team member’s responsibility, not just the domain of a specialized security team.
________________________________________
How to Bake Security into Your Development Process
1. Adopt a “Shift Left” Mindset
Move security processes as early as possible in the development lifecycle. This includes:
•	Code analysis during development.
•	Architecture reviews before implementation.
•	Continuous validation through automated tools.
2. Use the Right Tools
Modern tools make it easier than ever to detect vulnerabilities during development:
•	SonarQube and SonarCloud: Analyze code for security vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights.
•	GitHub Advanced Security: Detect and block issues like exposed tokens, passwords, and other sensitive data during commits.
•	Azure DevOps: Includes built-in threat protection to prevent unsafe code from being pushed to production.
3. Conduct Red-Blue Simulations
Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities:
•	Red teams identify weaknesses.
•	Blue teams learn how to detect and respond to breaches.
•	Use these exercises to educate teams on secure coding practices and architectural improvements.
4. Empower Developers
Equip your developers with the skills and knowledge they need to write secure code:
•	Train them on secure coding principles.
•	Provide guidelines for avoiding common pitfalls like storing passwords in plain text.
•	Foster a culture of ownership, where developers feel responsible for the security of their code.

The Benefits of Shifting Left
When you shift security left, you gain significant advantages:
1. Reduced Costs
•	Fixing vulnerabilities early is far less expensive than patching them after release.
•	Avoid costly rearchitecture and firefighting.
2. Improved Security
•	Fewer vulnerabilities mean less risk of breaches.
•	Build trust with customers by delivering secure, reliable products.
3. Faster Development
•	Automated security tools catch issues in real time, reducing delays caused by last-minute checks.
•	Developers can focus on delivering features rather than addressing preventable flaws.
4. Better Team Collaboration
•	Security becomes a shared responsibility, fostering a collaborative culture.
•	Teams work together to build robust, secure systems.

Real-World Example: Azure DevOps
The Azure DevOps team has set a high standard for shifting left:
•	Red-Blue Exercises: Professional hackers identify vulnerabilities, then educate teams on how to prevent them.
•	Automated Threat Detection: Advanced tools block unsafe code before it reaches production.
•	Developer Training: Teams are empowered to design and build secure systems from the ground up.
This proactive approach has significantly reduced vulnerabilities and improved system reliability.
