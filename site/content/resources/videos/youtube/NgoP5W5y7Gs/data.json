    "description": "# Shifting Left for Security: Building Resilient Software from the Start | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\n👋 Hi, I’m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I tackle one of the biggest mistakes in software development: treating security as an afterthought. From costly last-minute fixes to systemic vulnerabilities, leaving security checks until the end of the process is a recipe for disaster. Instead, I’ll show you how to **shift left**, bringing security practices closer to your developers to bake it into your product from day one.\n\n**📌 Chapters:**  \n1. 00:00 – Introduction: The Problem with Late-Stage Security  \n2. 03:15 – What Does Shifting Left Mean for Security?  \n3. 06:30 – Lessons from Azure DevOps: Red and Blue Team Exercises  \n4. 10:00 – Security by Design: Building It In, Not Testing It In  \n5. 13:30 – Tools to Enable Shift Left: SonarQube, GitHub, and Azure DevOps  \n6. 17:45 – Why Security is Everyone’s Responsibility  \n7. 20:00 – Practical Steps to Prevent Vulnerabilities  \n\n**🎯 Who This Video is For:**  \n- Developers and engineers responsible for building secure software  \n- Security teams looking to integrate best practices early in the development cycle  \n- Product managers and business leaders focused on reducing risk and avoiding costly breaches  \n- Organizations aiming to adopt modern, secure engineering practices  \n\n**📖 What You’ll Learn:**  \n- The risks of leaving security validation to the end of your process  \n- How to shift security left and empower your development teams  \n- Why security is a shared responsibility across all team members  \n- Real-world insights from Azure DevOps’ red-blue team exercises  \n- Tools like SonarQube, GitHub Advanced Security, and Azure DevOps for proactive vulnerability management  \n- Strategies for preventing vulnerabilities, from code analysis to removing sensitive data from dev machines  \n\n**💡 Key Takeaways:**  \n- Shifting left reduces vulnerabilities by embedding security into the development process.  \n- Late-stage fixes are expensive, risky, and often ineffective against skilled hackers.  \n- Tools and practices like static code analysis and secure CI/CD pipelines empower teams to prevent issues before they happen.  \n- Security is not just a task for a dedicated team, it’s everyone’s responsibility.  \n\nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we specialize in helping teams adopt secure development practices, integrate the right tools, and shift left to bake security into their processes.
