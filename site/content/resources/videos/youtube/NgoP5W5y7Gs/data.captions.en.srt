1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,000
many companies make the mistake of

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,840
security as an afterthought doing

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,080
security validation and Security checks

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,279
at the end of the

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,160
process this is

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,880
not a

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,760
small company problem it's not a big

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,320
company problem it's an all company

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,519
problem and some of the largest tech

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,800
companies have resolved this with

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,559
something you'll probably hear about in

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,760
in Dora in the Dora report which is

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,320
shift left shifting left shifting

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,760
everything as left as you can as close

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,239
to the developers as close to the

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,120
engineers as possible is how you resolve

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,000
these issues because what has been

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,199
happening is that we will do many years

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,520
of work on a product could be months

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,559
could be years could be weeks we do a

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,680
whole bunch of work on a product and

22
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,440
then we ship it to pen testing or

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,159
somebody who's going to do some security

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,760
validation for your for your product

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,400
even if it's yourselves doing it but you

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,759
just do it at the end and you find a

27
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,000
whole bunch of problems and some of

28
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,680
those problems are going to

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,119
be

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680
systemic to to how you've built your

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,479
product in the first place right we we

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,920
we we oh right in order to fix that

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,920
we're going to have to rearchitecturing

34
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,680
if we're late in the game we're ready to

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,159
ship everybody's asking us when when's

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,200
it going live so we need to get out we

37
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,799
need to blue blue Peter the heck out of

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,159
that and we get out our super glue our

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,600
sticky tape and we go figure out how do

40
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,719
we paper over the cracks in our product

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,880
to prevent the hackers getting in and

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,640
the problem is that hackers are super

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,680
good at peeling away the edges of those

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,240
things to get underneath um and prevent

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,840
those get access to your system and take

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,799
it over um I

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,920
I've been involved with um some

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,000
exercises that the Azure devops team did

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,120
where they hired a team of professional

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,920
hackers this is red blue exercises hire

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,080
a team of professional hackers brought

52
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,640
them in and their job they're the red

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,400
team their job is to hike the system and

54
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,959
the blue team's job is to a detect them

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,519
and B do something about them right

56
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,680
either prevent them getting in or push

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,879
them out or all of those things and the

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,200
red team always wins that's the thing

59
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,959
you have to realize is eventually the

60
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,400
red team is always going to win they're

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,879
going to find a flaw they're going to

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,599
find ways to peel up that that tape and

63
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,000
the only way for you to prevent those

64
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,480
things is to not have vulnerable code in

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,400
the first place not have vulnerable

66
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,400
architectures in the first place and the

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,360
only way to do that is to ref Factor the

68
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,120
heck out of your system to make those

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,120
things go away and then stop those

70
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
things from happening in the first place

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,120
so for example the Azure devops team

72
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,200
they do these red blue exercises and

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,480
then the red team's job is to go around

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,720
all of the teams in the organization and

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,000
show them how the red team was able to

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
use their code to get access to the

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
system and how they could have coded it

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,599
differently or architect it differently

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
or changed the way they do something in

80
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,519
order to prevent hackers getting in that

81
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,319
that's security by Design that's

82
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,439
security from the start that security

83
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,920
baked into the problem this is true for

84
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,400
a lot of different facets of software

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,560
engineering is that it's every team

86
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,040
member's problem right what the business

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,200
wants is every team member's problem how

88
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,599
much it's going to cost is every team

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,799
member's problem the customer's worries

90
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,680
are every team member problem and

91
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:08,519
security is every team member's problem

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,079
so building Security in rather than

93
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,000
testing it in building quality in rather

94
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,959
than testing it in is about shifting

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,959
left getting as many of those skills

96
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,120
that you need for your context um into

97
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,320
the hands of the developers that are

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,440
doing the work and there are a bunch of

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,479
tools out there that can help with that

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,280
there sonar sonar Cube and sonar Cloud

101
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,600
which enable your developers to analyze

102
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,039
their code and find and perhaps

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
hopefully deal with vulnerabilities um

104
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,680
there are known vulnerabilities that

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,960
happen in the code you can also use

106
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,880
GitHub which is part of they have a an

107
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,639
advanced security protection system uh

108
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,000
which you can use in GitHub or as part

109
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,639
of aure devops and to again analyze the

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,840
code find problems poke at it it's why

111
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,440
when if you're a developer and you try

112
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,840
and upload um some code that has a pat

113
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,320
token or other thing that looks like a

114
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,199
security token or a password into the

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,120
system you will be prevented from

116
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,800
checking in that code from committing

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,080
that code from the repo from doing a

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,720
push to production by GitHub and as your

119
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,440
devops because the advanced threat

120
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,280
protection is detecting that and

121
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,680
preventing it from getting into the

122
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,360
system in the first place shifting as

123
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,080
far left as we possibly can to validate

124
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,360
that those things are not going to cause

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,000
those vulnerabilities a really common

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,319
vulnerability is is developers on dev

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,280
machines putting passwords in text files

128
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:51,560
right on dev machines there's all sorts

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,960
of vectors uh that hackers can use my

130
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,080
advice are capability to help you is

131
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,720
within the context of Shifting left and

132
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
enabling your teams to have the

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
knowledge and skills they need to be

134
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,360
able to prevent and remove as many of

135
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
these issues as possible before they

136
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,880
become an
