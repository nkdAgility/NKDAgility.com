1
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,710
you

2
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,230
you

3
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:59,850
oh my name is Martin Henchy wit special

4
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,320
scrum trainer with scrum dark I want

5
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,320
little chat today I'm

6
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,110
some of this information comes from some

7
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,670
well-known sources I'm going to

8
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,670
elaborate on those saucy

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,290
party

10
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,479
you

11
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,180
Hey

12
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,200
you

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:49,840
80% 81% all development shops see

14
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,840
they're agile

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:58,460
that's based on Forrester Research that

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:04,460
of that 81% around 80% and 82% I think

17
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:09,050
and our say that they're doing however

18
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:12,940
the reality that almost 81% of them are

19
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:16,970
lying that's the thing that we find

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,650
anybody out there who is a trainer a

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:24,750
coach a scrum master at will know that

22
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,740
these things are almost never

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,130
so how can we tell the real thing

24
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,220
from what might be considered

25
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,530
I do have some very concrete measures we

26
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,880
can use they are not mine they come from

27
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,250
another organization which I will

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,730
describe I just find them interesting

29
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,730
enough

30
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,090
you

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,900
only 22% of organizations and short

32
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,480
iterations

33
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:05,880
that's iterations of six weeks or less

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,090
the manifesto does say that we should

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,090
have

36
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,359
six weeks or less or get stuff in front

37
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:19,730
of our customers six weeks or less the

38
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,299
scrum guy you would see at 30 days our

39
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,299
last one

40
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,140
but if you don't have short iterations

41
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,330
and

42
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,050
are the only ones that do then the

43
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,050
likelihood of you being

44
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:45,160
and only 16% have an order backlog this

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,780
is one I do not understand if an

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,780
organization is going to spend

47
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:53,590
honey

48
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,239
getting there

49
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,599
having a team of software engineers

50
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:04,019
working through a body of work why would

51
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,019
you not want to make working on the most

52
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,530
sixteen percent have an ordered backlog

53
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,530
you'll probably find that

54
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,540
we have something they would call a

55
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,540
backlog at all

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,590
only 13% do retrospectives closing that

57
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,550
feedback loop it's super important and

58
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:39,700
how do we make sure that don't do the

59
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,700
same thing wrong all the time tight

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,300
act or not just what we just did but how

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,069
we did it

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:55,199
it better store so this data that I'm

63
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:59,180
using here and comes from Forrester

64
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,669
Research I have a slide which with the

65
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,919
the original data for that I found it

66
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,650
pretty interesting

67
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,879
feel free to and have 50 yourself

68
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:15,419
because really the reality today with

69
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:17,780
organizations is that while it looks

70
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,780
like

71
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:24,789
hey they're doing the right thing it's

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:29,590
secret is we're all a mess in sight I

73
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,939
don't know any service orientated

74
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,389
organization I'm actually I'm thinking

75
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,389
of

76
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,230
thank where I've heard of our consultant

77
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,550
developer going in and really liking

78
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,410
what

79
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:53,060
behind-the-scenes things tend to be a

80
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,060
little bit interesting

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,460
you

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,099
let me check at the the I can do

83
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,099
something about the sound

84
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,000
you

85
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,800
you

86
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,650
so I'm not sure if I managed to actually

87
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:22,440
fix the sound or do something about it

88
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,440
hopefully that's ah

89
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:32,740
one comment on why it's so hard to

90
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:39,820
change it's it's a cultural thing we

91
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:42,370
like to as humans we like to do really

92
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,740
the same thing we get stuck in our way

93
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,840
of doing something and unless we feel

94
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:52,690
that we're empowered to make changes

95
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,500
through that process then um it's it's

96
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:59,710
very very difficult I just googled why

97
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:04,120
has changed so hard and Dilbert and I

98
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:07,500
had a plethora of choices for em but

99
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,500
what constitutes

100
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,180
so there's something that we all know

101
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,840
and love this is the the tyranny of

102
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,569
terrorism and being very specific here

103
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,689
I'm trying to avoid the term waterfall

104
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:27,360
for for very specific reason

105
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:31,430
look at them as I go through but

106
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,120
ultimately you'll see this process

107
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,310
reflected in many organizing

108
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,960
fireman's through to designing through

109
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,560
to implement the verification and

110
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:45,470
maintenance you might even see in

111
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,270
organization that they have HR

112
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,089
department they have our sales

113
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,690
department they have our IT department

114
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:55,700
they have an apartment as completely

115
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,100
separate entities and there's a very

116
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,900
good reason why we ended up in that

117
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:05,930
position it's not necessarily good now

118
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:09,370
but for the time when those ideas came

119
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,480
about it was the right way to approve

120
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,940
but times have changed we have more

121
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,080
understanding of how humans interact

122
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,930
with work we have more understanding

123
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,390
about the complexities of a lot of the

124
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:28,940
world and most people know do a

125
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:32,360
cognitive work so let's have look why do

126
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:37,630
we work that way so we need to kind of

127
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:42,260
go back in time a little bit go back to

128
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:47,120
three at nineteen eighteen ninety before

129
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:51,220
eighteen ninety people generally lived

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,600
pretty close to where they work they

131
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,220
whenever they had a problem they just

132
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,310
rallied around and figured out how to

133
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,370
solve it supportive innovation I need to

134
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,520
work very very close to their family and

135
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:08,720
and if you were doing a job you did the

136
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,300
whole job not just part of the job so

137
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,160
you can see there the the cobbler on the

138
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,279
right the apprentice learning how to

139
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,850
make the shoe and the reality is that

140
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:24,459
that cobbler probably knew the person

141
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:27,290
who they were making the shoe for the

142
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:30,940
knew what their job was how they were

143
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,100
going to use the shoe that product and

144
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,740
the cobbler can make that shoe with that

145
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,880
person in mind they probably made that

146
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,880
person's previous

147
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,119
and they know that that person can come

148
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:45,829
back in and whenever they've got a

149
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:48,529
problem with the shoe so they get old

150
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:51,889
they can they'll know all the experience

151
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:54,290
that that user that person has had with

152
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:58,269
that work and that's a very powerful way

153
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:01,639
to build products that have a very high

154
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:05,109
Happiness ratio with theirs but how do

155
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:11,689
we scale that it can be very difficult

156
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:14,569
so in just after the 1890s the

157
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:19,339
Industrial Revolution kicked off into

158
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:22,879
food and it was a time of lots of money

159
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,339
was made but you can see in those

160
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:30,499
pictures that there are people doing

161
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:34,069
very individual tasks I would struggle

162
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:38,779
to even understand what these folks were

163
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:41,209
making something around for sure with

164
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:45,049
boats in it it could be clocks it could

165
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:48,259
be parts for cars it could be um washing

166
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:50,749
machines it could be any sort of device

167
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:53,419
we don't really know and it doesn't

168
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:56,029
really matter for the individual sitting

169
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:58,819
at their workstation they only need to

170
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,410
do the one thing I usually use the

171
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,129
example of Charlie and the Chocolate

172
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,970
Factory

173
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:07,369
and Charlie's dad's had a job before he

174
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,299
lost his job to a robot and his job was

175
00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:13,900
screwing the top on toothpaste bottles

176
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:17,170
like a very

177
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:21,100
ask and when we do menial tasks our

178
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,620
brains disengage from the work so what's

179
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,680
what's that's the difference here is

180
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,450
that on the Left we have the cobbler

181
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,970
making the custom shoe for the

182
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,550
individual person that they know that

183
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,130
they interact with they understand the

184
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,410
whole process whereas on the right we

185
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,260
have the factory floor where the

186
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,180
individual users don't really don't

187
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,030
really even care don't even need to know

188
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,370
what the thing is that they are creating

189
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,540
they probably have some idea it's

190
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,200
probably difficult to work in a factory

191
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,060
and not know output is but do they

192
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,990
really understand how their piece of the

193
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,640
puzzle contributes to the overall thing

194
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,770
they're just doing exactly what they're

195
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,200
told

196
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:08,140
so there were two really big thought

197
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,730
leaders at the time the first was a

198
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,150
gentleman called Frederick Winston

199
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:19,260
Taylor and he has a comment that I think

200
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:21,520
you'll find very in keeping with our

201
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,020
understanding of how current management

202
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,120
practices like that think of this is the

203
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,700
foundation of current management

204
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,770
practices hardly a competent worker can

205
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,440
be found Tudor does not devote a

206
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,920
considerable amount of time to studying

207
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,370
just how slowly they can work and still

208
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,209
convince their employer that they are

209
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,639
yes

210
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,800
if you think about that position of

211
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:49,579
distrust that people are trying not to

212
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,449
work and that's a very common mental

213
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:56,480
practice for management for project

214
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:59,119
managers for the way people manage their

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,160
people in the world today

216
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:02,869
other are not saying as everybody there

217
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,879
are lots of progressive people out there

218
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:09,709
but is a very common mindset and they're

219
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:12,220
starting to change but it's changing

220
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,220
very slowly

221
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:22,320
they were invented something called the

222
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:24,870
scientific management method

223
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,580
and it was based on the knowledge at the

224
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:29,100
time so what they did was they developed

225
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:32,670
standard methods for performing each job

226
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,920
best practices they divided workers into

227
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,470
appropriate ability based groups for

228
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,940
each job so and you know they're going

229
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:45,570
to have the steelworkers

230
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,770
the for one of a better expression the

231
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:52,440
project managers the coders the testers

232
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,650
the operations having them all as

233
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,990
separate ability based groups they

234
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:00,570
understand that so they should all work

235
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,820
together on that one task you saw in the

236
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,560
pictures of the factory floor and the

237
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,740
they have everybody that does that one

238
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,290
task together so they can deliver those

239
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,490
standards they train the workers in

240
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,730
those standard methods because there's

241
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,990
no no thought we need to remove thinking

242
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,420
and we're just going to plan their work

243
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,390
so they do it the way we tell them to do

244
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,980
it and and we're going to create a bunch

245
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:31,100
of wage incentives to

246
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:32,600
you'll see some of these things in maybe

247
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,380
the current management practices of your

248
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,850
organization

249
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:39,019
hopefully you work in a more progressive

250
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,850
organization but Taylor had somebody who

251
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:44,839
came after him kind of a disciple

252
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:48,110
somebody who looked up to his work and

253
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:52,160
that was a gentleman called Henry Gantt

254
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,380
and Henry Gantt and came up with some

255
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,320
things we know and love today apart from

256
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,529
the Gantt chart but he created the tasks

257
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,980
and bonus system of which payment he

258
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:08,209
created our basic wage based on expected

259
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,760
low performance so if we think from a

260
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:13,760
position of distrust of our employees

261
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,370
they're gonna try and work less so let's

262
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,029
pay them like we expect them to work so

263
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:22,190
pay them last for their work and then

264
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:27,279
we'll give them bonuses if they manage

265
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,279
to meet the expected professions

266
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:34,920
that we we sent a vice by default and

267
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,320
also if we're going to have all of these

268
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,130
folks that need told what to do because

269
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,330
we're removing thinking then we need

270
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,209
managers to manage them

271
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,589
the Pyke's t of the work you might need

272
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,410
more managers and you might need

273
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,770
managers to manage the managers but the

274
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:56,770
manager should be motivated based on

275
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:59,410
getting bonuses on the outcomes of their

276
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,440
staffs so if you think of well I worked

277
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:05,020
in Merrill Lynch I had to fill out a

278
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,730
bunch of status reports at the end of

279
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,459
each week which I would give to my dev

280
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,370
leet who elected them together for all

281
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:15,100
of their direct reports and passed it on

282
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,750
up the chain everybody had a head count

283
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,620
they were accountable for that head

284
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:24,250
count and the amount that was delivered

285
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:27,699
they also henry gantt and came up with

286
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:30,340
this thing is is unknown i like to call

287
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,200
the modern school system and you may

288
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,929
hear folks refer to the modern school

289
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,179
system even today and when they refer to

290
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,039
it they're referring to this something

291
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,230
little bit like this picture here let's

292
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,270
that was like my class in school

293
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:47,200
although this was a lot further ago and

294
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:49,960
but everybody in a modern school

295
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,520
everybody sits in rows people do the

296
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,620
same thing at the same time there's no

297
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,899
talking you gotta put your hand up and

298
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,980
incentive based learning and reward for

299
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:04,809
fulfilled tasks these are techniques

300
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:07,450
designed a factory workers the modern

301
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:09,779
school system was designed to do that

302
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,710
was thank decree remove thinking and

303
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,380
just do it you're told

304
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,880
just follow the set of tasks you've been

305
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,200
given it doesn't matter if you don't

306
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,110
understand it

307
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,530
[Music]

308
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:27,640
so many of us grew up in the system many

309
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,980
of our kids are in more of a hybrid

310
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:35,559
system where teachers are trying to push

311
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,820
away from this idea of rules but they

312
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,890
you know they're they're struggling

313
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:42,940
against a system like we are that

314
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:44,980
defaults to the old way you go to those

315
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,580
places in the Netherlands where they

316
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:52,470
have changed the school system to be or

317
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,470
in keeping with what we expect

318
00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:00,799
group Isis learning together presenting

319
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:03,169
the stuff that happened in the modern

320
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,029
workplace so really there's no

321
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:08,510
difference between the modern school

322
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:10,680
system and that management scientific

323
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,710
management

324
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:18,090
nostril revolution in the factory floor

325
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:21,420
these two folks optimized for output and

326
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,220
not outcome you're our coach or a

327
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,970
trainer at following this you'll know

328
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,870
that's already and but I find that

329
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:34,740
knowing why something is a certain way

330
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:44,000
help us combat some of the the eight

331
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:48,240
years and in 1908 and this was the first

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,790
Harvard Business School I think this

333
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,630
might be the graduating class of Harvard

334
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:56,790
Business School and and loads of the the

335
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,740
leaders of the time the the people who

336
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,620
would be managers at the time or who are

337
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,580
going to be managers at the time and

338
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,580
flocked to these and

339
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:13,850
schools doing MBAs so this was the first

340
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:18,260
MBA and we know those ideas have lasted

341
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:21,200
for a long time in the 50s this this new

342
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,110
way of working started to emerge and

343
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,160
become more prevalent across the board

344
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,950
not just as part of option align process

345
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:35,140
so dividing people into specialist

346
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:38,480
skills marketing sales contracts

347
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,470
development testing and all of our

348
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,860
separate things

349
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,140
and and create things sequentially in

350
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,820
hand things between the different

351
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,690
sections that doesn't think you know the

352
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,690
complexity of the work

353
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:59,309
then round about the 1950s the US

354
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:03,860
military complex who is I think still

355
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:08,010
the largest buyer in the world it's it's

356
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,540
they have a lot of employees

357
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,240
a lot of people that work with them a

358
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:16,140
lot of consultants and because they wear

359
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,990
such a large buyer and their their power

360
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:23,790
to push vendors and consulting companies

361
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,870
towards this model that they wanted to

362
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:30,240
use was immense and most people couldn't

363
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,100
escape it and if you work with any large

364
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,500
consulting company they probably work

365
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,470
with the Department of Defense

366
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,570
especially at the time and if you work

367
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:46,770
with the varmint event you must do this

368
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:49,470
this new staged process so we adopt it

369
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:53,520
and eventually it just becomes part of

370
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:55,800
their procurement Sassy's that's also

371
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,070
the Chairman processes that we know and

372
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,320
love

373
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:02,910
and that I struggle with when I'm

374
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,780
working with customers I even had an

375
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:09,740
engagement with a with a customer and

376
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:15,570
because it was uh I think it was I

377
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:17,370
remember the the big consulting company

378
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,130
I was working with and I was doing a

379
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:22,970
short engagement like a day's worth of

380
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:28,730
work and they couldn't figure out how to

381
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:31,590
pay me their procurement processes so I

382
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,140
basically handed me a stack of cash

383
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,760
because they just couldn't figure out it

384
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:39,390
wasn't worth the effort of going through

385
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,300
the process I didn't get training

386
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:46,020
engagement at Royal Bank of Scotland in

387
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,940
Edinburgh because they couldn't get the

388
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,960
procurement process done in time it was

389
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:53,640
just not possible yes that seems to be

390
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
the way things are and a lot of our

391
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,030
larger organisations with a little

392
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,920
bureaucracy bureaucracy comes with these

393
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,170
different departments and separating

394
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:05,370
people into that work so if we fast

395
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:08,510
forward again to the current modern

396
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,920
times and this stuff was applied to

397
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,670
software development and it didn't work

398
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,670
out so well

399
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:26,090
expediency is that off but I've got an

400
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:29,180
interesting article so um the largest

401
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:36,240
organization in the world with the most

402
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:38,670
employees in the world as realized they

403
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,000
made a mistake this particular

404
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:49,740
organization and as 2.8 million

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,640
employees largest employer and a 739

406
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:57,890
billion dollar budget they are in fact

407
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:02,120
the Department of Defense in the US and

408
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:05,700
they have realized that they've created

409
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,470
this monster that is the sequential

410
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,480
working process and it's gone through

411
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,900
all companies are in the world so in

412
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,890
[Music]

413
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:20,940
2010 they brought in a bunch of agile

414
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,770
folks so I believe I believe Jeff

415
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,980
Sutherland was there Kent Beck was there

416
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:28,200
a few other folks I don't know what

417
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,300
everybody that was involved and they got

418
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,000
together to rewrite how can we change

419
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:37,680
our procurement rules to take advantage

420
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,810
of these new thinking and new ways so

421
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,390
they pulled it all together and and the

422
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,840
new procurement rules which mandated

423
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,990
short iterative cycles of delivered

424
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,490
value to to the customer which is on the

425
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:56,970
defense at went live in 2013 but as you

426
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,860
can imagine and now that the procurement

427
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,050
rules have been changed

428
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,600
agile then becomes a buzzword of

429
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,330
software development and therefore all

430
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,700
projects now declare themselves to be

431
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,540
agile and so the department events

432
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:16,980
created this document called detecting

433
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:20,460
add ups that is for their procurement

434
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,130
officers to really understand what it

435
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,290
what it is they're looking for in a

436
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,610
vendor when a vendor says they're agile

437
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,900
how do you know they're telling the

438
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,600
truth how

439
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:37,340
you know

440
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:40,210
I so I have here and some questions for

441
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:45,800
you this is a small number of questions

442
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:48,650
and I usually do this in a large

443
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,810
auditorium so I usually get everybody to

444
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,060
stand up I'm gonna stick to questions

445
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,370
and after each question if your answer

446
00:25:53,060 --> 00:26:00,020
is no then you should sit down obviously

447
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:04,550
you do it metaphorically so the first

448
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:07,760
question our team's delivering working

449
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:10,850
software to at least some subset of real

450
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,030
users every iteration including the

451
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,870
first and gathering feedback I'm gonna

452
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:21,170
clarify real users real users does not

453
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,130
mean you a t-bill users does not mean

454
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:28,510
attack

455
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:31,810
users means people using your software

456
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,470
in a production environment real users

457
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:38,630
means

458
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:42,080
if you aren't doing that and you're not

459
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,610
you're not agile and that's step one are

460
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,580
you doing this

461
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:49,520
getting real feedback and otherwise

462
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,669
there's no agility there second question

463
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,429
is there a product charter that lays out

464
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:58,659
the strategic goals of your project and

465
00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:02,950
do all members of the team understand

466
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,950
what they are and how

467
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,500
how the work they do contrary

468
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:17,630
and if not then you're not doing agile I

469
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:20,450
would recommend a book called turn this

470
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,670
ship around by David Marquette talks

471
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,320
about pushing responsibility down the

472
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,720
organization helping everybody

473
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,130
understand at what the goals directives

474
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,800
are so that they can make better

475
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,370
decisions and stop telling people what

476
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,020
to do

477
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:39,350
that's this next one our team's

478
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:42,230
empowered to change their process based

479
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,450
on what they learn and they can they

480
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:48,710
change their iteration pace can they

481
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:50,720
change what they do their review

482
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,400
perspectives can they choose to do scrum

483
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,680
can they choose to do a Kanban can they

484
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,330
choose to do something else and all of

485
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:03,290
those things need to be true otherwise

486
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:06,170
and agile again oh three more questions

487
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,510
that was number three is feedback from

488
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,420
users turned into concrete work items

489
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,330
for Sprint teams on timelines shorter

490
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,640
than a month

491
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,680
I need to get feedback from those users

492
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,730
that in the first one we delivered our

493
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,790
real software - and we get feedback from

494
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:30,130
them and we update the product backlog

495
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:32,830
we bring that information our planning

496
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,320
of the of the future on timescales

497
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:38,020
shorter than one mark if not then

498
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,260
unfortunately we're still not doing

499
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,360
agile our team is empowered to change

500
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,590
requirements based on user feedback this

501
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,330
can be a real problem in bureaucratic

502
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,560
organizations that have a separation or

503
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:56,700
still have a separation between

504
00:28:52,560 --> 00:29:02,130
contracts sales and engineer

505
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,170
shouldn't be that separation to this

506
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,970
type of thing you have are a concrete

507
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,240
thing signed off by somebody who doesn't

508
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:11,100
really understand the interest in

509
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,080
actually building stuff you go to build

510
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,510
stuff you get in front of users user

511
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,130
needs a change wants something different

512
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,260
what you're working on is not quite

513
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,860
right we need to be able to make those

514
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,550
changes and if not then yep you guessed

515
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:30,620
it we're not doing edge and the last one

516
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,620
I think is or is that the second

517
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:37,860
M is the full ecosystem of your project

518
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,170
agile agile programming teams followed

519
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:45,650
by linear bureaucratic deployments

520
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:48,450
ealier ultimately there should be no

521
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:50,100
human interaction between a developer

522
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,500
committing a line of code and getting

523
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,230
into production if you're going to have

524
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,870
human interaction it should be limited

525
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,660
to the clicking of an approval button or

526
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:05,120
some kind of sign-off process it should

527
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:07,980
not be any script any deployments any

528
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,150
reading server setting up that none of

529
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,150
none of those things

530
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:21,630
and if you can't say yes to all of those

531
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:26,340
questions then you're probably not it

532
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:28,529
and Ross that line into the world

533
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,169
and those are those are hard lines to

534
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:33,900
cross and this example is from the

535
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:37,470
Department of Defense in the u.s. they

536
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:40,940
apply this now for both hardware and

537
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:43,200
software so if you're building a new

538
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,100
guided missile for the Department of

539
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,090
Defense

540
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,570
all of these things need to be true

541
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:54,919
order for you

542
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:56,299
when that procurement and I think that's

543
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,190
that's hard I don't think they're

544
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:59,000
definitely not there yet that's why

545
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,309
they're doing this

546
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,710
this article in order to encourage

547
00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:08,380
people to move a little bit faster and

548
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:11,330
do those things but ultimately by

549
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,000
improving our processes and practices by

550
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:18,019
getting quicker at delivering by using

551
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,970
those feedback loops and large projects

552
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:25,750
can get up to 600 percent more more

553
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:28,460
success and more likely to be successful

554
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,250
not numbers smaller for small projects

555
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:33,830
because the risk is less they're usually

556
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,210
closer to the customer is easier to have

557
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,029
a discussion and change what you're

558
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:39,559
doing in a small project but in large

559
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,870
projects that can be incredibly

560
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,169
difficult there's a lot of legacy code a

561
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:47,720
lot of legacy ideas legacy procedures

562
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,850
and practices and that that can be

563
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,500
difficult now I would encourage you to

564
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:56,779
look at other folks processes and see

565
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,809
the way they do it

566
00:31:56,779 --> 00:32:02,539
I like the largest company I know of to

567
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:05,570
have actually made a successful agile

568
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:09,379
transformation our agile evolution or

569
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:11,690
start their agile evolution is Microsoft

570
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:14,299
they've made a lot of changes in the

571
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:17,690
last eight years they moved to

572
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:23,240
continuous delivery and are doing all of

573
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:25,610
those things but don't just look at

574
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:29,570
somebody else's process and try and

575
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:31,190
rubber stamp it onto your own and there

576
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,730
are many practices out there they're

577
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:37,720
safe the Spotify model I always find the

578
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:41,259
Spotify model I'm using because of the

579
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,029
the article was a point in time

580
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:49,190
don't do this here's what we're doing

581
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:52,370
now and the Spotify is not doing what it

582
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,529
describes in that article anymore

583
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,220
they've moved on from there and these

584
00:32:54,529 --> 00:33:01,429
are maybe our starting point a place to

585
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,980
glean some ideas but make sure you have

586
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:07,910
the ability to create dynamic

587
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:16,179
create and manage your process and and

588
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:20,299
I'll leave you with a lovely mammal or a

589
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:23,330
statement from the US Air Force this is

590
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,790
a clarifying statement about a mammal

591
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,100
and it says if you read the top

592
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,799
underlined and highly discuss

593
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,260
discouraged from using rigid

594
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:36,260
prescriptive frameworks such as scaled

595
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:39,590
agile framework and safe framework and

596
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,840
in an effort to move towards a DevOps

597
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,440
and a more dev cell cops whatever you

598
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,250
want to call it DevOps and agility and

599
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:52,580
things like safe and any prescriptive

600
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,490
model is potentially harmful to your

601
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,760
ability to innovate potentially harmful

602
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,809
to your ability to change and it's not

603
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:07,840
used by successful software commercial

604
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,840
organizations should be an indicator

605
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,360
as I would say that the art of

606
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:18,330
simplicity is a puzzle of complexity we

607
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,899
have to try and make things as simple as

608
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,899
possible

609
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:33,889
do that over time well thanks for

610
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:37,220
watching hopefully you enjoyed beam I'm

611
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:39,109
hoping the silent problem was a little

612
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,859
limited to a particular time frame and

613
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:45,579
if not I will have to look at and I

614
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,579
managed that

615
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,490
very much

616
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,399
you
