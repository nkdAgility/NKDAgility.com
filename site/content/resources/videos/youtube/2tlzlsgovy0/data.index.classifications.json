While it references maximizing value and ownership, it does not explicitly define, measure, or validate customer outcomes or ensure those outcomes drive delivery decisions. Feedback loops are discussed generically, not in terms of customer/user input. The discussion is strategically aligned with agile principles but lacks detailed exploration or evidence-based linkage to actual customer value, as required by the definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece aligns well with agile principles and stresses the importance of vision and alignment for teams, suggesting value delivery. However, it falls short of making customer outcomes and feedback the explicit foundation for product decisions—so fits partially, but not fully, in the Customer Focus category.",
