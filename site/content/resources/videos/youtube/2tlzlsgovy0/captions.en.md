Is there a product vision that lays out the strategic goals? Do all members of the team understand both, and are they able to see how the work that they do every day contributes to your goals and strategic objectives? If you don't have that story, if you speak to the team and you ask them what the vision is, what the strategic goals are, and they need to go look something up, then they don't fundamentally understand them. They don't understand how their work contributes, which means that we're probably not being very agile. 

We need to push responsibility down the organisation. We need the people that are making the tight technical decisions every day to have the most context so they can make the best decisions possible to maximise the value that you get in your product.
