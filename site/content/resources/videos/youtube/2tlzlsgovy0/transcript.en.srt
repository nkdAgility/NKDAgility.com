1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,000
is there a product Vision that lays out

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,240
the Strategic goals and do all members

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,400
of the team understand both and are they

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,200
able to see how the work that they do

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,320
every day contributes to your goals and

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,800
strategic objectives if you don't have

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,320
that story if you speak to the team and

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,519
you ask them what the vision is what the

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,359
Strategic goals are and they need to go

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,480
look something up then they don't

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,040
fundamentally

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,040
understand them and they don't

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,360
understand how their work contributes

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,280
which means that we're probably not

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,520
being very agile we need to push

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
responsibility down the organization we

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,039
need the people that are making the

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,000
tight technical decisions every day to

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,039
have the most context so they can make

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
the best decisions possible to maximize

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,000
the value that you get in your product
