1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,440
so the question is how will the

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,420
immersive learning experience change the

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,580
game for people with a couple of years

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,920
experience in the field

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,859
um I think that's going to even level up

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,300
from folks that don't have so much

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,880
experience in the field and are learning

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,039
it for the first time because you'll

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,460
already be coming to the class the first

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,980
time round with those questions that

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,300
perhaps newbies are coming the first

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,040
time around you're coming the first time

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,360
around with questions that you already

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,719
have

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,820
um and we could perhaps enable even even

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,379
greater degree of double Loop learning

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,059
the first time round as well as the

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,160
second time round so you you're coming

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,079
with those questions we can talk about

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,840
them as part of the theoretical

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,000
experience I I don't know about other

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,719
trainers I know the trainers that I work

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,160
with we love it when people come

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,020
pre-prepared with a whole bunch of

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,480
really hard questions right because

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,220
that's what makes it interesting for us

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,380
we're not teaching the same thing all

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,680
the time it's something different and

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,700
specific and ideas and situations and if

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,700
we can

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,500
get the theory with some of those ideas

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,780
answered the trials and tribulations

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,119
that you already have in your

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,799
organization and then you get the

35
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,500
exercise the assignment where you're

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,299
going to try that new thing with that

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,820
forward knowledge in your organization

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,240
and then we can Loop it back again and

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,900
get that feedback do the debrief I think

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,960
it would be even more even more powerful

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,520
for folks that have have

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,939
been doing this for a couple of years

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,860
and and want to really understand it

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,720
