So the question is how will the immersive learning experience change the game for people with a couple of years experience in the field? I think that's going to even level up from folks that don't have so much experience in the field and are learning it for the first time because you'll already be coming to the class the first time round with those questions that perhaps newbies are coming the first time around. You're coming the first time round with questions that you already have.

Um, and we could perhaps enable even greater degree of double loop learning the first time round as well as the second time round. So you're coming with those questions; we can talk about them as part of the theoretical experience. I don't know about other trainers. I know the trainers that I work with, we love it when people come pre-prepared with a whole bunch of really hard questions, right? Because that's what makes it interesting for us. We're not teaching the same thing all the time; it's something different and specific and ideas and situations. 

And if we can get the theory with some of those ideas answered, the trials and tribulations that you already have in your organisation, and then you get the exercise, the assignment where you're going to try that new thing with that forward knowledge in your organisation, and then we can loop it back again and get
