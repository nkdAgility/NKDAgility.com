Have you ever worked with a product owner who really, really should have been a project manager? Where they're focused on work breakdown and delivering to time and task with a Gantt chart? If you have, you've encountered an agile bandit product owner. It creates lots of negative impacts for the team. They don't care about the work; they're just interested in their tasks, and they are not a connected, engaged, empowered team. That way lies agile banditry. Stop it.
