What does your dream and your consulting week look like?

It looks pretty busy, I think, right? So there's two. When I'm consulting with a customer, there's multiple work streams going on, right? There's work streams where you're liaising with leadership and trying to encourage the larger changes that maybe need to happen. But there's also the day-to-day work of sitting in with teams and helping them get suggestions, right?

Because that's the difference between coaching and consulting. Coaching believes that the customer already knows the answer, and consulting doesn't assume that they already know the answer. As a consultant, I'm going to make a suggestion, right? Well, maybe we should monitor the flow of work. Have you been collecting these metrics? Maybe we can figure that out. Here's some tools that you might use with the tools you've got in order to understand and visualize more. Let's try that, right? So you're making more proactive and directing suggestions based on long experience.

For me, the most awesome week is a week where I'm able to help as many people in the organization as possible while still continuing to make progress on the overall strategic initiatives, right? Because ultimately, strategic initiatives are long term and don't help people day-to-day.

So I really enjoy working with teams, perhaps sitting in on some of their events, right? It could just be a daily, you know, fly on the wall. I'm not going to interrupt them. I'm not going to make suggestions during those events, but I'm going to have a chat with them afterwards, perhaps just with the Scrum Master, right? Because it's kind of their, I don't want to step on their toes either, but help give them advice, point them in directions, and help them see the gaps, maybe in what the team's understanding and their knowledge, and how they can perhaps fulfill them and how they can fill their own gaps.

So for me, constantly engaging with teams while also dealing with the long-term leadership and strategic stuff is probably my dream week as an agile consultant.
