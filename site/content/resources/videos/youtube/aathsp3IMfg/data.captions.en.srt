1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:13,340
what does your dream and your Consulting

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,340
week look like

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,939
it looks pretty busy I think right so

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,580
the the there's there's two

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,980
when when I'm Consulting with a customer

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,080
there's there's multiple work streams

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,480
going on right

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,899
there's work streams where you're you're

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,340
liaising with leadership

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,899
and

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,600
trying to encourage the larger changes

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,260
that maybe need to happen but there's

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:50,000
also the the day-to-day work of

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,340
um um sitting in with with teams in

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,660
helping them get suggestions right

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,600
because that's the difference between

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,360
coaching and Consulting is coaching

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,460
believes that the customer already knows

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,140
the answer

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,939
um and Consulting doesn't assume that

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,740
they already know the answer we're gonna

22
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,479
as a consultant I'm going to I'm going

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,220
to make a suggestion right well maybe

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,720
maybe we should we should monitor the

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,880
flow of work have you been collecting

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,380
these metrics right uh maybe we can

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,840
figure that out here's some tools that

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,180
you might use with the tools you've got

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
in order to to understand and visualize

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,659
more let's try that right so you're

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:31,520
making more proactive and directing

32
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:35,400
suggestions based on long experience and

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,220
for me the most awesome week is a week

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,060
where I'm able to help as many people in

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,860
the organization as possible while still

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,200
continuing to make progress on the

37
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,420
overall strategic initiatives right

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,460
because ultimately strategic initiatives

39
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,200
are long term and don't help people

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,119
day-to-day

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,540
um so I really enjoy

42
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,180
working with teams

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,340
um perhaps sitting in on some of their

44
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,280
their events right it could just be a

45
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,259
daily you know fly on the wall I'm not

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,140
gonna interrupt them I'm not going to

47
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,840
make suggestions during those events

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,819
but I'm going to have a have a chat with

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,860
them afterwards perhaps just with the

50
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,720
scrum Master right because it's it's

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,340
kind of there I don't want to step on

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,140
their toes either

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,680
um but help give them advice Point them

54
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,140
in directions and help them see the gaps

55
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,120
maybe in what the team's understanding

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,099
and their knowledge and how they can

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,700
perhaps fulfill them and how they can

58
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,400
fill their own gaps so for for me

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,560
constantly engaging with teams while

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,360
also dealing with

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,819
um the long-term leadership and

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,640
strategic stuff is probably probably my

63
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,640
