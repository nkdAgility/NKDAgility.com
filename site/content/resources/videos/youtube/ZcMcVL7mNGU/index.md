# Product Management Mentor Program Final

#agile has come a long way since it's inception in 2001, and with that shift from #projectmanagement to #productdevelopment, #productmanagement has evolved significantly.

In the beginning, a 2-day workshop was enough to help product managers make the shift to #agile and embed agile values, principles and practices in their approach to product development.

At NKD Agility, we believe that the increasing degree of complexity in markets and product development environments means that we need a blend of professional training, coaching and consulting to really help product managers thrive in a complex environment.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the NKD Agility Product Management Mentoring program and why we believe this is an essential program in the journey of a product manager.

Visit https://nkdagility.com/global-consultancy-services/product-management-mentor-program/ for more in-depth information on the program and how your organization can thrive with this approach.
