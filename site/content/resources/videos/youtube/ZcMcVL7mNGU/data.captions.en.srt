1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
the product management Mentor program

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,480
for software development is really a

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,880
program to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,000
allow companies that are building

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,000
software products to build better

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,480
software products there's a huge gap in

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,199
the way organizations approach software

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,279
development and software engineering and

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,480
and and building those types of products

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,679
where when we start

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,320
transitioning they realize that the work

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,680
is so different and so complex and

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,120
different all the time that the kind of

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,920
more common ways of managing projects

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
like you might for building houses or

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,039
Building Bridges is just not going to

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,440
work um because everything's so much

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,559
more complex so they try and shift from

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,440
those old ways of working where you have

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,120
uh uh Gant charts and plans and

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,320
Milestones and deadlines and they try

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,600
and move

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,359
towards uh agile right what ever people

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,400
are calling it locally they move towards

25
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,080
that story

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,880
and they don't they take away those

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,799
milestones and Gant charts and

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,640
traditional project management tools

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,360
right that are supporting that story

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,000
they take those away and then they don't

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,680
replace it with anything and they wonder

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,439
why it doesn't work out right things

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,840
start to go wrong fairly quickly things

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,240
go off track we're not going in the

35
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,399
right direction and it's because they're

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,680
missing a piece of that puzzle and it's

37
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,920
a pretty big piece of that puzzle and

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,759
it's Vision value and validation that's

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,399
what's missing they they don't have what

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
um if you go look up him in the

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,159
dictionary it's a group of people

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,920
working together towards a common goal

43
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,680
so if you want people to work together

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,439
towards a common goal whether they're an

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,320
individual team or they're your whole

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,200
company you need to have that common

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,640
goal that they can all get behind and

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,240
they can all um follow that they all

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,720
understand that it's been communicated

50
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,800
effectively and what I see in a lot of

51
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,120
organizations is they'll maybe

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,560
communicate at once they'll maybe set

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,239
directives and they don't involve the

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,840
people that are part of the the story

55
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,920
the people that they want to follow that

56
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,080
goal and the reality is that people

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,160
don't follow your goals they follow

58
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,959
their goals so in order for you to

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,800
engage with all of the people in the

60
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,560
organization the people in the software

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,599
teams building the software the people

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,920
in the legal department in in in cyber

63
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,680
security and all of those different

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,440
parts and have us all working together

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,879
towards that common goal of building and

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,159
delivering this product to customers

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,239
that's going to maximize the value means

68
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,239
that we all have to be going in the same

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,319
direction we all have to understand the

70
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,280
same thing right what is it we're trying

71
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,440
to achieve and that is one of the main

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,080
focusing

73
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,000
of the product management Mentor program

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,879
we're talking about tools and techniques

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,120
we're talking about theories and

76
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,640
principles and practices that help us

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
understand why those things are needed

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,239
and how we get everybody moving in the

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,200
same direction how do we as product

80
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,920
managers enable not just to communicate

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,760
that Direction with the people within

82
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,440
our organization or outside of our

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,000
organization as well to involve those

84
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,439
stakeholders and those customers in the

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,799
story but also do we how do we measure

86
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,480
whether we've been successful right how

87
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,920
do we bringing in things like

88
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,080
evidence-based management right looking

89
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,159
at our or our whole product and are we

90
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,120
moving in the right direction are we

91
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,519
looking at the right numbers do we have

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,599
the right measures to be able to figure

93
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,799
out what're where we're going looking at

94
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,680
things like hypothesis driven

95
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,040
engineering practices right why are you

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,879
adding this feature what would you like

97
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,040
the world to look like after this

98
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,360
feature has been delivered what would

99
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,920
you expect the difference to be how are

100
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,000
we going to measure that building that

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,079
whole story Into the way we build

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
products so that we can maximize the

103
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,720
value that we deliver to the business

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,159
for the return for the money that

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,159
they've put in
