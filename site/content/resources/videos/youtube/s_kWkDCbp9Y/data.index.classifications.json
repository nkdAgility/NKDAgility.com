    "reasoning": "The content focuses on Agile coaching with an emphasis on understanding team context, empathy, domain knowledge, and continuous learning. While these are valuable in engineering environments, the post does not address agentic engineering concepts like systemic observability, DevOps ethos, human/AI agency, or ethical AI collaboration. The main audience—Agile coaches and practitioners—is tangentially related, but the discussion lacks explicit or deep engagement with agentic engineering principles, nor does it discuss decentralised decision-making, feedback-driven adaptation, or AI integration. No penalties were applied, as the content is current and neutral in tone.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content centers on Agile coaching and the value of understanding team context, offering limited conceptual overlap with Agentic Engineering but lacking explicit discussion of agency, systemic feedback, or AI/human autonomy in engineering. Alignment is marginal and mostly incidental.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on effective Agile coaching, emphasizing domain/context awareness and empathy for teams, but never mentions autonomous AI agents, agentic principles, or software delivery scenarios involving intelligent agents. There is no discussion of agent integration, contextual intelligence powered by AI, or agent/human synergy as defined in Agentic Software Delivery. While it covers context-aware coaching—a tangential overlap—its depth and alignment to the category are minimal. The audience is close (software delivery practitioners), and some signal is present (discussion of real-world practice integration), but fundamentally, the topic is classic Agile coaching, not agentic delivery.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content centers on traditional Agile coaching and understanding team context. It does not address agentic software delivery or the integration of autonomous AI agents. Any fit is minimal and incidental, not substantive.",
