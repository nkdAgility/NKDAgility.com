To be an effective Agile coach, you must have knowledge of the type of work, the context within which the team that you're working with works. Now, most people, most Agile coaches, get that knowledge by having spent many years doing that work. Right? You might have been a software engineer for many years. You might have been a tester. You might have been a UX designer. And then, as you understand the value of Agile, you bring in some of those tools and techniques and move up into that space of Agile coach. But you need to have an understanding of what the people that are doing the work are doing, why they're doing it, how they're doing it, and what is the context within which they work.
