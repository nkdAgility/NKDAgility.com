1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,160
so the question is what are the steps

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,240
that the team can follow If the product

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,759
owner is

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,040
incompetent um that's pretty strong

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,800
right incompetence is pretty strong but

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,720
I have met a ton of product owners that

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:25,160
would perhaps fit into that category or

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,240
the other adjacent category which is I

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,039
don't know what I'm supposed to do or my

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,800
organization doesn't allow me to do the

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,559
things I'm supposed to do

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
right so it's not it

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,320
manifests the same way the outcomes the

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,640
same and ineffective product owner um

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,360
but the reason could be incompetence or

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm not allowed right within the bounds

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,039
of the org or I don't feel I'm allowed

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,440
um in both of those those

19
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,960
circumstances I would probably suggest

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,800
that there's some um onus on the scrum

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,800
Master to figure out how to how to deal

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,559
with that right it might not might not

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,920
be ideally the product owner is the

24
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,119
person with the money who can resolve

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,920
those problems but often they're not so

26
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:15,159
what can you as a scrum Master

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,360
do um with the support of the whole team

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,080
right perhaps with the support of the

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,720
whole team perhaps with the support of

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,360
the person who is the product owner to

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
engage with the business to engage with

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,880
the organization and the way the

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,040
organization is structured in order to

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,840
enable a greater degree of product owner

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,280
ship right that's that's part of the

36
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,880
scrum Master services to the product

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
owner um if if if you don't have a scrum

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,920
Master on your team just pick somebody

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
in your team who who has an interest in

40
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,799
dealing with some of those things and

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
they can be the scrum Master right you

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,840
they don't need any special skills um

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,280
they just need to be a bit battle

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,119
hardened in working within your

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,159
organization which if you've been

46
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,600
working there a while you probably are

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,640
and start going building those

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,520
relationships right who do you need to

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,719
speak to take out for dinner buy a beer

50
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,479
for in leadership in HR in the

51
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,439
organization to start building those

52
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,759
relationships for them to start seeing

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,720
your point build in those those back

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,760
channels um there's there's uh what was

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:21,480
that that that movie with the nuclear

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,400
explosion um uh in in the baseball game

57
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,080
uh clear and present danger no it was

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,120
the other one um anyway that movie which

59
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,720
you probably remember better than I do

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,440
uh uh the channels were how things got

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,440
done right between the Americans and the

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,640
Russians there was there was people uh

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,680
that

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,680
are low in the organization who are in

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,680
either organization who were able to

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,760
have conversations to trade information

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,360
to find out things that are going on

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,200
that that's one of the skills of a of a

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,040
scrum Master politic right it's politics

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
uh being able to practicing um um

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,519
politic getting into um the the

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,599
conversations that you need to get into

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
and in order to get into those

74
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,000
conversations you have to demonstrate an

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,200
understanding of the topic you have to

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,440
make small suggestions around the side

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,239
perhaps an email with one person who

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,560
then maybe invites you to some of those

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,799
conversations because you've

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,840
demonstrated uh your knowledge and your

81
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,319
capability um and then you know you

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,799
don't want to say anything unless you

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,159
actually can add value add value where

84
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,120
you can build up your knowledge and

85
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,959
experience in that space and and and

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,360
encourage change and that's how

87
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
everything gets done in organizations

88
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
right in especially when there are lots

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,640
of people that don't understand how to

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,599
do that so if you have a an ineffective

91
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,040
uh product owner um that's the best

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,760
route if you have an incompetent product

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,840
owner who really just shouldn't be in

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,200
that position at all they are not uh the

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,439
right person the the the old adage is

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,200
kind of true people are promoted to

97
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,799
their level of incompetence right um

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,079
people are good at their job so they get

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,519
promoted to the next level up um and

100
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,879
then in the next level up they're also

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,360
good at their job so they get promoted

102
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,799
to the next level up and they get to a

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,239
level where they're no longer good at

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,560
their job and that's where they stay um

105
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,920
when in reality organizations should

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,880
offer that capability to drop drop back

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,359
down right to to to you might have the

108
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,959
seniority but I I I'm I don't want to do

109
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,560
this job up here I want to do this job

110
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,919
here or this job even further down in

111
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,919
the organization I I really respect some

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,759
of the things I I meet people at at

113
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,600
Microsoft who've been a soft engineer a

114
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:38,280
a real coder um for for for 20 30 years

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,919
um inside of the organization and they

116
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,680
they take on more responsibility and

117
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,840
accountability by um mentoring other

118
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,080
people helping with other stuff but not

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,800
actually managing people um which often

120
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,320
is not a skill that lots of people have

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,520
right just like taking any any anybody

122
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,479
with skills with people and making them

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,960
a programmer is probably not a good idea

124
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,360
the converse is also also true um so

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,120
maybe that product owner is just not

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,199
meant to be in that position and there's

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,919
very little that you as a team can do um

128
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,400
there's certainly with the politic

129
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,440
around the side you could maybe let

130
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,319
people become

131
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,800
aware of the problem um but you need to

132
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,000
really skirt that moral and ethical area

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,960
of um should you be going behind this

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,080
person's back perhaps you go speak to

135
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,560
that product owner and say uh say say

136
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,319
say something in the first instance

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,800
although that might get you got to gauge

138
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:44,919
that situation yourself um but all the

139
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,240
team can do ultimately is be the best

140
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:51,880
team they

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,000
can um deliver working usable product be

142
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,680
that competence at that level and if

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
we're not building the right thing

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,759
that's not the team's fault that's the

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,479
product own fault and hopefully at some

146
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,520
point the organization sees that we're

147
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,560
continuously building awesome product

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,400
but it's the wrong product um and then

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,280
they see that light of it's the product

150
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,800
owner that's the problem not the team um

151
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,960
and perhaps the scrum Master can help

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,599
educate with that right not rather than

153
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,319
going behind the product owner's back

154
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,199
just explain to the business what a

155
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,680
product owner's job is what the team's

156
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,880
job is what their roles and

157
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,720
responsibilities are and hopefully

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,240
they'll be able to see what the problem

159
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,160
