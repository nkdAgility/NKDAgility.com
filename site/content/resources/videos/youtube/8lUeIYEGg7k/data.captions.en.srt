00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,839
agile Works exceptionally when it's just

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,880
one team but what happens when you've

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,599
got 10 or more suddenly all those simple

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,519
interactions become complex dependency

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,240
piles up and before you know it

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,400
everything slows down does this sound

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,160
familiar scaling agile isn't about

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,680
adding more teams it's about maintaining

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,119
the same level of agility across all of

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,640
your teams Frameworks like safe less and

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,040
Nexus each offer a different approach to

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,280
scaling but here's the challenge making

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
the right choice because what works for

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,320
one organization might not work for

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,760
yours and that's where we come in at

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,640
naked agility we don't believe in cookie

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,600
cutter Solutions we roll up our sleeves

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,320
and work with you to find the right

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
scaling model that fits your context

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
we've done this countless times with

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
countless organizations and trust me

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,079
it's never the same twice we help you

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,600
navigate the complexities avoid the

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,400
pitfalls and most importantly keep

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,159
delivering value at speed no matter how

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:15,960
big you scale so if you're ready to

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,960
scale without losing agility let's talk
