The content focuses strictly on human teams scaling agile practices, managing dependencies, and organisational agility. No topics involve AI agents, human-AI partnerships, distributed cognition with AI, or enhanced outcomes from human-AI synergy. The audience and focus overlap partially with some socio-technical practices, but without any mention of AI, partnership, or collective cognition spanning human and AI agents, the fit is very weak. The main intent is supporting human teams in scaling agile, with no AI context at all. Signal is adequate for agile practitioners but does not address the scope or thematic requirements of Collective Intelligence as defined.",

There are no direct mentions or even implicit discussion of Objective Key Results (OKRs), their principles, theoretical foundations, or practical implementation. None of the key topics—such as the definition of Objectives and Key Results, strategic alignment through OKRs, outcome measurement, or OKR pitfalls—are discussed. The content serves practitioners interested in scaling agile rather than those specifically seeking outcome-oriented goal-setting frameworks like OKRs. There is no indication of the audience being targeted for OKR-related practices, nor reference to John Doerr or 'Measure What Matters'. The intent is distinct from that of OKRs, being exclusively about agile scaling. As a result, all scores remain extremely low, reflecting that this content essentially does not fit under the 'Objective Key Results' category.",
