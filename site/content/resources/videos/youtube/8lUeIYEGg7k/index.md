 🚀 Scaling Agile Beyond a Single Team: The Real Challenge 🚀  

Agile works exceptionally well when it’s just one team. But what happens when you have ten? Or more? Suddenly, simple interactions become complex:  

🔸 Dependencies pile up  
🔸 Alignment breaks down 
🔸 Delivery slows to a crawl  

Scaling Agile isn’t about adding more teams—it’s about maintaining the same level of agility across all teams.  

Frameworks like LeSS, and Nexus each provide different approaches, but the real challenge? Choosing the right one for your organization. 

That’s where Naked Agility comes in. We don’t believe in cookie-cutter solutions. We roll up our sleeves and help you:  
✔️ Navigate the complexities of scaling  
✔️ Avoid the common pitfalls 
✔️ Keep delivering value—at speed—no matter how big you scale 

Because what works for one organization won’t necessarily work for yours. And scaling shouldn’t mean losing agility.  

If you’re ready to scale the right way, let’s talk.  Visit https://www.nkdagility.com
