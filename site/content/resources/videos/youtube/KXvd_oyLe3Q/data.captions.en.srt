1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,319
so when when customers engage with us

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,400
they're quite often in a place where

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,120
they they've identified a problem

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,519
themselves right um they don't they

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,600
don't they don't call a devops

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,439
Consulting service um randomly they have

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,600
some kind of problem that they've

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,119
identified and they W help figuring it

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,480
out and and what's the next thing to do

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,960
um probably the

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,559
biggest

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,480
um engagement I guess that I I saw was

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,800
with a a really large organization in

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,360
the oil and gas world and they had a a

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,000
product um that would I think it's

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,879
$50,000 a license for this product so

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,960
it's a desktop product and the pro the

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,680
main problem that they had was that um

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,039
okay I guess what they thought their

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
main problem was and what actually the

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,559
main problem was might be different

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,600
things this is this is I'm thinking from

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,600
retros ECT right because I've been been

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,840
through it and one of one of the main

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,880
problems that they had was that um they

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,159
had they had 90

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,799
teams in 13 locations in nine different

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,360
countries working on this

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,799
product each of those teams had their

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,840
own long-term branch that they worked on

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,960
so things would diverge um and they were

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,040
really could diverge for quite some time

33
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,880
could be as much as a year and they were

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,079
trying to mitigate that with an

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,360
application of force that's probably the

36
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,799
way I would think about it they they

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,320
they tried to solve the problem with an

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,399
application of force so what what they

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,119
did was they spun up um they spun up a

40
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,920
devops team right a dedicated devops

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,680
team here's our devops Engineers they're

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,360
in this Central area right some of you

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,640
have already spotted the problem um and

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,920
then they have they're not they they

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,119
can't change what all of these teams are

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,560
doing but they have to figure out how

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,039
they solved the problem of we want

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,360
continuous delivery we want to to have a

49
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:12,239
daily build of our product that was

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,040
their goal so they ended up creating a

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,959
bunch of infrastructure to allow them to

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,720
do that and managing that infrastructure

53
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,920
and they would manage it right the teams

54
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,640
didn't have to do anything and if the

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,319
teams changed something that was their

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,760
problem to go fix right um so you had

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,120
this team I think it was I think it was

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,720
eight or nine might have been his many

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,200
as 10 people but I think it was eight or

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,080
eight or nine people on this team and

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,319
their whole job was building this

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,560
product um so in order to do that they

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,560
ended up building a system um

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,959
that facilitated about 11,000 build

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,440
executions a

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,360
day that's 1.2 million build executions

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,959
a year and that was just to have a

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,360
working product every day so they would

69
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,319
have these uh temporary brand bres where

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,640
they brought the code together and like

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,959
automated merging of code from all of

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,319
these different branches all of those

73
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,080
different teams these 90 teams were all

74
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,799
on different Source Control Systems

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,000
different not only systems but platforms

76
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,200
as well so they might have

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,879
had might have had 10 teams on git 10

78
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,480
teams on team Foundation Version Control

79
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,959
they might have had 10 teams on sub

80
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,680
version another 10 teams doing something

81
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,959
else another 10 teams doing doing

82
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,239
another thing um so they all had

83
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,760
different capabilities different

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,400
branching capabilities different merging

85
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,040
capabilities and their build system

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,000
their build engine had to go reach out

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,680
to all of these systems and pull

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,480
together a version of the code and then

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,920
build it to be able to then uh create

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,799
this this unified version of the product

91
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,439
it was insanely complicated insanely

92
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,640
complicated and super expensive I think

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,159
in order to for a developer to work on

94
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,439
the product on their workstation in fact

95
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,920
to run it in production as well um you

96
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,120
had to have

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,879
like 100 cores I can't remember exactly

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,079
what but it was 128 gig ram uh lots and

99
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,840
lots and lots of cores 24 core machine

100
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:16,919
type of thing um it it was just obscene

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,519
the the the the the speed of the machine

102
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,639
required because it was a massive

103
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,600
complicated product and you couldn't

104
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,720
just build parts of it you had to build

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,600
the the the whole thing to make sure it

106
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,560
worked the whole platform and all all

107
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,360
the things that were built on top of it

108
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:37,199
um and it was just hugely

109
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,039
unwieldly so we did we did a a devops

110
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,560
assessment state of devops assessment

111
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,240
for them um we identified those key

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,800
areas everybody's on different Source

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Control Systems everybody's doing

114
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,639
everything differently um they had some

115
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,199
limitations because each I think there

116
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,400
was 13 different funding routes for this

117
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,240
product so they didn't have full control

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,560
of the the the whole thing but what we

119
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,880
were able to do was over and it was a

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,560
number of years because it's a really

121
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,199
big product a really big organization I

122
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,400
think there was something like six six

123
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,280
700 people working on it um and in

124
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
different locations and they weren't in

125
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,800
our in in the same reporting structure

126
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,479
right so you can't just tell them to do

127
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
stuff

128
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:24,039
and it took four

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:27,919
years to get everything Al lined into a

130
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,680
single Source control system right so

131
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,400
that we had we could do one build out of

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,840
this sord control system and result in

133
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,840
one version of the product and then how

134
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,600
do we fold down the branches so that

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,720
they don't have so many branches working

136
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,720
towards that model how do we work

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,280
towards this idea of Mainline

138
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,919
development right um it's these types of

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,479
ideas these types of outcomes that that

140
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,600
vastly

141
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
simplify the problem that companies are

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,280
trying to solve and it it people don't

143
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,240
get into these positions from a

144
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,919
nefarious intent

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,599
right um when this in this particular

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,720
example this product had been built and

147
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,800
worked on for 25

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,639
years they had

149
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,440
bought anybody who tried to compete with

150
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,120
them so bring that puzzle into that

151
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,840
piece into the puzzle right and you end

152
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,000
up with a massive product with a very

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,400
complicated architecture that's very

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,639
difficult in timeconsuming to work on so

155
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,160
you need lots of people that's very

156
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,759
distributed because all of these

157
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,440
different parts of the puzzle were

158
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,240
brought in from different different

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,800
entities that now all work for the same

160
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,280
company and they hadn't I'm I'm actually

161
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,120
going to get a phrase I'm going to

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,440
phrase it this way they hadn't taken the

163
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,680
time to pay back their technical debt

164
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,280
they'd acred debt you know you take we

165
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,080
we we use git we take on a company that

166
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,960
uses sub verion and instead of lets help

167
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,919
them migrate all of their stuff into get

168
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,440
and and fix all of the stuff that we

169
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,199
need to fix in order to bring it into

170
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,879
our system we're just going to leave

171
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:06,639
them as is and we're going to plug into

172
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,879
them and pull their stuff out and and

173
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,440
integrate it into our system so rather

174
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,639
than doing that work because it seemed

175
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,360
insurmountable at the time um they they

176
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,199
they they didn't do that they they just

177
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,400
pulled the stuff in and on top of that

178
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,319
perhaps things didn't exist 25 years ago

179
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,599
so they have a lot had a lot of teams

180
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,319
that were on their own custom inhouse

181
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,800
built Source control system because when

182
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,319
they started working on this product

183
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,879
there were no large scale Source Control

184
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:45,080
Systems you were probably talking about

185
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,680
s h visual Source safe at the time but

186
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,159
visual Source safe was developed at the

187
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,599
time of Noel networks and had a Max size

188
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:55,520
of about 5 gig this thing was

189
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,840
ginormous right so how how how do you

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
manage that well you have to build your

191
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,479
own systems when you go to try and

192
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,080
create an automated build perhaps there

193
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,400
isn't a commercial automated build

194
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,159
system so you build your own and then

195
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,440
once a commercial automated build system

196
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,120
becomes available you you adapt into

197
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,680
that but you're actually just calling

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
out to your existing thing because

199
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
you've not taken the time to rewrite

200
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,319
everything because that's an inable task

201
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,159
so we integrate it rather than refactor

202
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,199
right we're missing all of those

203
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,159
refactors over time and it just gets

204
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,280
bigger and bigger and bigger and more

205
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,080
unwieldly and more wieldly and more

206
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,680
unwieldly and sometimes it's difficult

207
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,839
that's a terrible expression but

208
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,159
difficult to see the forest for the

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,519
trees right all of these things like

210
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:43,719
what should we go fix where should we go

211
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,480
look where should we start what's the

212
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,959
what's our biggest bang for our buck

213
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,360
that we can go go fix and figure out and

214
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,600
perhaps lots of little things we need to

215
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,120
fix around the edge

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,800
so what I would

217
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,800
expect an organization to get what's

218
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,440
what's like the outcome and Improvement

219
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:06,399
that that our customers can

220
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,760
expect it's a more effective process

221
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,880
right we're talking about taking what

222
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,680
the organization is doing right now

223
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,000
within usually within the context of a

224
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,040
product when you're talking about devops

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,120
but it could be holistically across an

226
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,640
organization and figuring out how do we

227
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,640
eliminate waste how do

228
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,000
we ensure that we have automation that

229
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,320
we can automate

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,440
that that automation is effective right

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,240
because it's also you can have

232
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,040
ineffective automation like that massive

233
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:42,600
build system I was talking about um and

234
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,360
how do we simplify simplify simplify so

235
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,480
what I would expect the outcomes to be

236
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,720
would be reduced cost to deliver new

237
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,360
features reduced time to deliver new

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,040
features um

239
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,760
improved H um happiness of the people

240
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,279
that are building in the product because

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,839
they're spending less time struggling

242
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,440
with the complexity that we've created

243
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,880
over time and more time focusing on

244
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,839
solving the business

245
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,519
problem so the these are are

246
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,920
multipliers for your capability to

247
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,399
deliver a great example of those

248
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,720
multipliers is actually the Azure devops

249
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,160
team at Microsoft right so they create a

250
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,839
product called Azure devops used to be

251
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,600
team Foundation server when it was local

252
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:39,720
and back in 2010 before they started uh

253
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,920
doing much more frequent deliveries and

254
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,720
all the Automation and focusing on these

255
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,920
things before they brought devops into

256
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,000
their story um they were delivering

257
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,720
about 25 features to production each

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
year and that was with 600 people

259
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,920
working on it and they were delivering

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,959
about 25 new features lots of bug fixies

261
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,079
lots of little tweaks but 25 new

262
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,440
features to production each year

263
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,480
um fast forward to five years

264
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,160
later they'd spend a huge amount of time

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,880
investing in

266
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,760
um reducing the amount of time it takes

267
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,600
them to build their product from I think

268
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,240
wow I think it was like three or 4 days

269
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,120
7 72 hours plus to build their product

270
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,760
down to 3 and a half

271
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,560
minutes right those types of

272
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,680
capabilities enabl to go from 25

273
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,560
features to production each year to

274
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,680
nearly 300 features to production each

275
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
year with the same number of people and

276
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,240
the same people it's not different

277
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,480
people it's the same people right so so

278
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,120
what we're talking about is holistically

279
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,920
scaling up all of the people that we

280
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,079
have within our context so that

281
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,320
everybody understands devops everybody

282
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,560
understand refactoring and clean code

283
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,720
and what the impact is on all all of

284
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,480
these things so that we can make them

285
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:08,120
more effective over time um and yeah you

286
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,360
you will be you'll be faster you'll be

287
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,920
Slicker and it will be cheaper right

288
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,399
that's that's what we're talking about

289
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,279
when we talk about bringing devops and

290
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,040
the devops philosophy into an

291
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:22,360
organization but it takes skill we can't

292
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,360
install devops in your

293
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,839
organization you still have to do the

294
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,440
work if you can find a consultancy that

295
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,720
say is that they will do all the work

296
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,720
for you your people are not going to

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,560
learn anything they're not going to have

298
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,120
gone through the pain of actually fixing

299
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,560
their problems it's like getting a

300
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,040
cleaner in to clean your teenager's room

301
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,320
right is your te has your teenager

302
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,480
learned to clean up their room no no

303
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,120
they haven't they're just going to do

304
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
the same thing over and over and over

305
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,760
again when you do those big rewrites of

306
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,440
your product and you take the same

307
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,120
people and get them to rewrite your

308
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,000
product what do you think is going to be

309
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,959
the

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,920
outcome except a Rewritten product

311
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,600
that's in exactly the same state over

312
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,279
time as your existing product because

313
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,320
they've not gone through that Crucible

314
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,519
of learning the pain of actually

315
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:21,560
cleaning up the pain of pulling that

316
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,040
moldy plate out from under the bed and I

317
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,120
have to deal with this moldy plate and

318
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,120
maybe next time I won't leave the plate

319
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
because I don't want to deal with that

320
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,240
moldy plate right that that's what we're

321
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,040
talking about with engineering practices

322
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,720
we're talking about upskilling dealing

323
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,120
with our own

324
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,560
crap right dealing with it ourselves so

325
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,240
that we make less of that stuff in the

326
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,760
future that we do things in a in a

327
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,519
better way that enables us to be Slicker

328
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,519
and more effective
