# What specific outcomes and improvements can clients expect when they engage with your DevOps service

ðŸŽ¥ Video Summary: Tackling Technical Debt and Complex Product Architectures in DevOps Consulting

Introduction: Why Customers Seek DevOps Consulting

- Customer's Dilemma: Companies usually approach DevOps consultants because theyâ€™ve identified a problem they can't solve on their own. It's rarely a random decision.
- Real-World Example: One significant engagement involved a major oil and gas organization with a $50,000 per license desktop product. They knew they had a problem, but the real issue was more complex than they initially thought.

ðŸš§ The Challenge: A Global Development Puzzle

- Massive Scale: The product had been developed over 25 years, involving 90 teams across 13 locations in 9 different countries.
- Acquisitions Complicate Matters: The company had acquired various competitors, integrating their technologies into one complex product architecture.

  ðŸ”„ The Core Problem: The root issue wasnâ€™t just the scale or complexityâ€”it was the accumulation of technical debt.

---

ðŸ’¡ Unveiling the Core Issue: Technical Debt

- Neglected Integration: Instead of fully integrating acquired companies' systems into their own, the company left them as-is, leading to fragmented and inefficient processes.
- Technical Debt Explained: By not addressing the accumulated technical debtâ€”like continuing to use subversion systems instead of migrating to Gitâ€”the company created a convoluted architecture that was difficult and time-consuming to manage.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

- Technical Debt: Ignoring or postponing the integration of systems and technologies can lead to long-term inefficiencies and complex challenges.
- Proactive Integration: When merging different entities, it's crucial to integrate their systems fully to avoid future bottlenecks and technical debt.
- Consulting Insight: A fresh perspective from a DevOps consulting service can help uncover deeper, systemic issues that might not be apparent at first glance.
