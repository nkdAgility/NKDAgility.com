It mentions specific practices such as engaging users regularly, prioritizing feedback using MoSCoW, and integrating feedback into sprints. The discussion offers clarity on the structured steps teams can take, which directly supports the category definition. However, while it is rich in detail regarding procedures, some sections lean towards motivational aspects rather than purely methodical instructions, preventing a higher score.",

Furthermore, there is significant focus on practices and activities rather than the cultivation and embedding of capabilities within the organizational culture and processes. Although the application of Agile principles aligns with some characteristics of capability, the main focus remains on actionable work stemming from user feedback, rather than cultivating organizational competencies.",
