2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:09,040
concrete work items for teams on

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,440
timelines shorter than one

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,080
month we need to engage with our users

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,960
we need to take the feedback that they

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,000
give us and turn it into something that

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,359
we can actually

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,119
