My name is Dave Fresh. I'm a developer with Health Grades. I was vehemently opposed to the course initially because I didn't understand the value in spending at least a couple of days away from development in order to understand the process that we set myself. We were already using what is focusing on the foundations of Scrum, understanding how to use Scrum in a professional manner, and really focusing on refinements. Is that something that we have been missing previously? So the course changed your mind very quickly.

This is going to help Health Grades because we are going to be delivering valuable, deliverable software or products every sprint, as opposed to throwing things against a wall, which was our sprint previously. Too often, people, especially individuals from the business, will come over and say, "Hey, I need this now," without understanding that there's an order of systems in a process that needs to happen in order for what they believe to be an emergency to be implemented.

Absolutely, I think it's important for everybody to understand the process that needs to be applied here, whether or not they are a full-time member of the squad. They need to be aware of how to operate.
