1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,790
my name is Dave fresh I'm a developer

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,790
with health grades

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,309
I I was vehemently opposed to the course

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,460
initially because I didn't understand

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:21,520
the value and spending at least couple

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,919
of days away from development in order

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,330
to understand the process that we set

8
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:27,330
myself we were already using

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,670
what is focusing on the foundations of

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,550
scrum understanding how to use from the

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,080
professional manner and really focusing

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,230
on refinements is that something that we

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:46,000
have been missing previously so the cost

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,000
changed your mind very quickly

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,589
this is going to help health grapes

16
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:55,329
because we are going to be delivering

17
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:58,019
valuable deliverable software or

18
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:01,210
products every sprint as opposed to

19
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:04,420
throwing things against a wall which was

20
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:07,090
our sprint previously too often people

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,369
especially individuals from the business

22
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,530
will come over and say hey I need this

23
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:14,439
now without understanding that there's a

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,539
there's an order of systems in a process

25
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:18,460
that needs to happen in order for their

26
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:21,479
what they believe to be an emergency to

27
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,479
be implemented

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,189
absolutely I think it's important for

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,840
everybody to understand the process that

30
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:32,020
needs to be applied here whether or not

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,640
they they are a full-time member of the

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,329
squad they need to be aware of how to

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,329
operate
