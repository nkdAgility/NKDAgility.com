1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,019
so the question was why why would I

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,420
encourage people to follow a

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,400
certification path in their career

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,540
Journey

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,580
um

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,560
and I I would say for the same reason

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,060
that people go to university for the

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,840
same people that the reason people do

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,439
any course it gets your foot in the door

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,180
um certifications themselves

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,980
have no value

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,559
how many of you have ever had to pull

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,540
out your University degree right 10

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
years after you've graduated from

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,520
University you don't maybe your first

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,320
couple of jobs you had to I I had to

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,260
pull out my University degree when I

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,059
applied for my H-1B to go work in the US

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,340
uh

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,440
um and they actually didn't like it they

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,960
didn't like it I had to I had to

22
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,600
contribute to two years of my

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,379
professional experience to make up the

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,320
year that the US degrees have more than

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,020
my degree that I took but it all worked

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,680
out but that that's why you have those

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,299
things right is somebody wants somebody

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,159
wants to

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,460
um validate your knowledge it doesn't

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,060
mean you have skills right skills and

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,240
application of learning is different

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,100
from just amassing knowledge but kind of

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,680
at a minimum for certain roles you

34
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,119
should have knowledge right

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,580
um at the very least if you're going to

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,979
be working on a scrum team you should

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,079
probably have read the scrum guide

38
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,400
if I was an employer how do I validate

39
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,560
that you've read the scrum guide well I

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
could I could sit and interview the

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,439
thousand people that apply and ask them

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,520
have you read the scrum guide or I could

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,259
just put in the in the in the job spec

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,720
uh psm1

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,399
right and if you can pass the psm1

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,780
you've read the scrum guide it would be

47
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,040
very difficult to pass the psm1 if

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,899
you've not read the scrum guide so

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
there's a minimum bar there's a litmus

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
test there's a quick check that an

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,380
employer can do to whittle down the

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,940
Thousand candidates to the 200

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,380
candidates that I've actually read the

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,500
scrum guide because we want somebody who

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,760
can work on a scrum team and so taking

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,620
that

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,959
assessment

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,540
um it that that that's why it's valuable

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,459
from a professional career perspective

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,959
um external professional career

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,780
perspective like somebody looking at you

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,580
but internal professional career

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,780
perspective it's about validated

64
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,800
learning

65
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,400
right

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,340
um how if I take if I take a course

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,459
um and there's no assessment at the end

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,379
um how do I know I understood what was

69
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,580
the intent for me to understand from the

70
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,400
course

71
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,860
well I don't right I just have to well I

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,760
didn't pay attention for half of it and

73
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,720
I forgot the other 60 and now

74
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,180
um

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,860
I'm I'm I've done the course so I should

76
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,080
be able to go do the job but that's not

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,580
really how it works right our memories

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,580
don't work that way our understanding

79
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,440
doesn't work that way so taking and

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,080
that's why I really like the way that

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,060
scrum.org do the validated learning that

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,800
you get you effectively get two attempts

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,319
to take the assessment right

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,360
so when you at the end of the class

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,420
um everybody gets a token to take the

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,500
assessment and if they take it within 14

87
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,080
days you get a free second one if you

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,459
fail if you pass well you passed right

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,680
but in both cases you get your results

90
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,140
broken down by category with a

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,000
percentage and you're able to look at

92
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,760
that and say well

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,500
um I didn't know I had a low score I

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,239
passed but I had a low score in this

95
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,659
area so perhaps I should study this

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,480
material and the thing you get with the

97
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,519
scores on it actually has a link to a

98
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,159
bunch of material to study in that topic

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,019
that scrum.org have created and there's

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,220
a scrum Master learning path there's a

101
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,459
product owner learning path there's

102
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,799
various learning learning paths and that

103
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,959
additional learning even if

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,700
I got a high score in it I want to dive

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,379
deeply into that topic because I liked

106
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,900
it how do you know where to start or

107
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,180
where to look here's a place to start so

108
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,220
that validated learning for you and your

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,160
career path because the thing

110
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,019
once you get Beyond getting in the door

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,540
right the foot in the door that that

112
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,740
gets you to the actual interview is you

113
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,820
still have to demonstrate in the

114
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,479
interview that you actually understand

115
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:34,220
stuff and there are so many posts on

116
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,979
LinkedIn talking about how

117
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,780
how to validate the the person at the

118
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,400
interview actually understands the thing

119
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,040
that you're talking about and all these

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,360
trick questions and you you just need to

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,400
know your stuff

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,259
and in order to know your stuff you have

123
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,840
to have done the studying absorb the

124
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,780
information and and and understood it

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,940
and you don't get that from not

126
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,660
looking at anything not reading the

127
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,639
books not watching the videos not uh

128
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,800
reading the blog posts right of

129
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,320
investing some time and effort in

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,000
figuring out what this thing is

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,400
um and and

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,600
training courses are a great great way

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,660
to level set and then what's next I mean

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,120
the output of of a scrum.org classes I

135
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,680
think all of them have at least 10 books

136
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,180
here you go here's a bunch of books to

137
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,720
read here's a bunch of additional

138
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,419
content to read each trainer adds more

139
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,759
content into that story as you go and if

140
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:34,979
you take the time to to go

141
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,639
check it out learn how to do different

142
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,039
things you can you can improve your

career trajectory

um so that you you you get further

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,620
quicker right that's that's really what

146
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,620
careers are about
