# Why do you encourage people to follow a certification path in their career journey?

The world of #agile is inherently complex. If building complex solutions or solving complex problems was a straightforward process of observing a formula, traditional #projectmanagement would do the trick and there would be no need for #agile or #scrum.

So, when you enter the working world as a #scrummaster or #productowner, you need guardrails that can help you progress on your journey through an apprenticeship and onto mastery. You need to invest a great deal of time and effort in learning, practicing, and receiving coaching if you are going to be great at what you do.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of certification in your journey to mastery, and how following Scrum.Org certification paths can help ensure that you are studying the right materials, listening to industry respected thought leaders, and receiving validation of your knowledge and capabilities through an official certification body.
