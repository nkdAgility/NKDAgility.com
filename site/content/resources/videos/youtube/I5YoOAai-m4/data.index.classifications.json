    "reasoning": "The content is focused on distinguishing Agile coaches from professional coaches, emphasizing the value and technical expertise that Agile coaches bring (such as deep knowledge of lean and Scrum). However, there are no direct or indirect mentions of Service Level Expectation (SLE) or any of its key components (definition, calculation, probability, or cycle time ranges). The thematic alignment is tangential at best, since although Agile and Scrum are discussed, the main ideas and depth of discussion remain firmly on the coaching distinction. The audience partially overlaps (Agile/Scrum practitioners), but the absence of SLE focus keeps the signal low for this category. No penalties apply, as there is no outdated or contradictory content, but no relevant SLE material appears either. Thus, the final confidence reflects an extremely low fit to the SLE category.",
