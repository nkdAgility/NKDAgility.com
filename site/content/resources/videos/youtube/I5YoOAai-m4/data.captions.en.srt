1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,759
so the reason that I believe that an

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,240
agile coach is greater than a

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,059
professional coach is that an agile

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,680
coach will have deep

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,340
technical knowledge in understanding

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,939
um agile and its practices lean and its

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:27,000
practices uh flaw

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,180
um all the theory behind these these

the story that they didn't already have

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,719
um whereas a professional coach is

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,300
helping the people in the situation

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,800
understand and deal with things that

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,539
they already know right they already

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,460
know how to solve the problem and

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,260
they're helping them work through it and
