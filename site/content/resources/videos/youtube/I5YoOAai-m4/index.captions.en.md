So the reason that I believe that an agile coach is greater than a professional coach is that an agile coach will have deep technical knowledge in understanding agile and its practices, lean and its practices, um, all the theory behind these very technical practices that they can leverage in helping teams and organisations be more effective by bringing something to the story that they didn't already have. Um, whereas a professional coach is helping the people in the situation understand and deal with things that they already know, right? They already know how to solve the problem, and they're helping them work through it. An agile coach brings more.
