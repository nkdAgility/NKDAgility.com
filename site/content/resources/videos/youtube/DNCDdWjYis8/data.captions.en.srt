1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
worst trait in unskilled scrum Masters

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,480
is probably

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,280
their thinking that they're the boss of

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,139
everybody thinking that they should be

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,240
telling people what to do thinking that

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,160
they should be micromanaging thinking

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,660
that they should be setting up the jira

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,960
environment thinking that they should be

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,880
allocating the work and all of that is

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,980
just crap that's nothing to do with

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,800
being a scrum Master being a scrum

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,040
Master is about helping teams be more

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
effective and all of those things I

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,480
can't think of an easier way to make a

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,300
team ineffective

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,379
focus on what helps the team stand on

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,899
their own be better at what they do

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:49,340
being visibly present

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,340
and yeah
