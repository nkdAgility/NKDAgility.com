Worst trait in unskilled scrum masters is probably their thinking that they're the boss of everybody, thinking that they should be telling people what to do, thinking that they should be micromanaging, thinking that they should be setting up the Jira environment, thinking that they should be allocating the work, and all of that is just crap. That's nothing to do with being a scrum master. Being a scrum master is about helping teams be more effective, and all of those things I can't think of an easier way to make a team ineffective. Focus on what helps the team stand on their own, be better at what they do, being visibly present.
