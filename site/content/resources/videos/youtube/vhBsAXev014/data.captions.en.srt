1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,280
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,200
pocalypse is

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,439
chaos and Chaos seems to be the watch

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,240
word of almost every

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:21,240
organizations um digital transformation

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,279
agile

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,320
transformation whatever watchword

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,359
transformation they're they're using at

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,599
the moment um and it it comes out as as

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,079
as kind of two things that res in chaos

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,200
one is about the work and then one is

12
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,960
about how we do the work so the one

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,440
about the work is really about poor

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,280
product ownership results in

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,520
chaos right um and it results in chaos

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,399
because if we've got no well

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,760
communicated

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,559
goals then everybody's able to go in

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,559
whatever Direction they like if you

20
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,799
think of uh you've got you've got trust

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:11,200
and you've got uh uh no trust trust

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,200
autonomy and alignment and where where

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
do you fit in that story in your

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,799
organization so most organizations

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
create high levels of alignment by

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,360
having lots of rigorous project

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,479
management things going on they have

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,400
milestones and they have dates that you

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,600
have to hit and most of those dates are

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,840
just somebody's decided what that date

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,640
is right there's not a reason for that

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,759
date just they've decided it but it

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,280
creates this bounded environment within

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,680
which everybody moves forward but when

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,960
you

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,560
remove the the the the the milestones

37
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,560
and the Gant charts and the

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,280
deadlines what would you expect to

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,079
happen if you don't fill that void with

40
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,640
anything but chaos right that nobody

41
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,479
knows what direction they're supposed to

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,200
go what needs to be done when how do we

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
create that bounded environment in the

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,920
agile space is very different from how

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,400
we created it in the traditional

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,640
management and traditional project

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,560
management uh structure so the way we do

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,280
that is and we talk about in the product

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,959
owner class is Vision value and

50
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,440
validation you need to create this core

51
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,920
strategic Direction so that everybody

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,959
understands what direction they're going

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,200
in uh talked about it recently in the

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,599
evidence-based management class as well

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,040
you've got your your strategic objective

56
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:40,040
that's your um uh your your reach for

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,760
your North Star is your strategic

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,159
objective and then because that's like a

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,959
reach and it's a bit far out it's

60
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,800
difficult for people to see how the work

61
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,720
that they're doing every day connects to

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,800
that story so you need some kind of

63
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,760
intermediate strategic goal that brings

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,640
that

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,680
into it's not a stretch anymore this is

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,120
something we think we can work towards

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,920
right it's it's progress towards our our

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,680
reach our North Star but that gets us

69
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,239
there and then we can start thinking

70
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,560
about what are we tactically going to do

71
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,599
what are our tactical goals what are we

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,200
going to do what's our next step we're

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,440
going to take towards that

74
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,319
next destination in our journey towards

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,840
our North Star our outcome and then we

76
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:35,040
can start to see how the work we're

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,519
doing every day people doing the work

78
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,439
can see how the work they're doing every

79
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,200
day connects to the Tactical goal

80
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,360
connects to the intermediate strategic

81
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,319
goal and helps work towards fulfilling

82
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,799
the overall strategic goal in North Star

83
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,920
and with that connection you enable all

84
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
of those people at every level in your

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,319
organization depending on what level

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,840
they're looking at what level goals they

87
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,159
care about right at every level in your

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,439
organization to make decisions the El

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,640
that best fulfills the vision and

90
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,720
purpose of the organization because they

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,159
all understand and are going in the same

92
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,680
direction but if you don't have that if

93
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
you don't provide that and you take away

94
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,959
the milestones and Gant charts and

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,680
reports suddenly there's chaos right so

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,919
that's one way that that chaos

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,040
occurs the other way I mentioned was in

98
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:32,600
implementation chaos this is the The

99
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:36,560
Meta information around how you do a

100
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,440
digital agile devops whatever thing you

101
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
want to put in front of it

102
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,520
transformation some kind of change in

103
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
your organization and this is really

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,960
around poor

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,560
communication right you you you don't

106
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,120
involve the people doing the

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,880
work in the story that you're trying to

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,560
tell and you don't communicate that

109
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,600
story that you're trying to tell back to

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,000
them in in a way that helps them

111
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,960
understand that reinforces continuously

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,919
reinforces the story that we're trying

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,680
to get to and what I see most

114
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,000
organizations do is somebody really

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
senior in the organization sends out an

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
email saying we're going to move in this

117
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,880
new direction we're going to do this new

118
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,319
thing and that's it they just magically

119
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,800
expect things to happen and what really

120
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,639
happens is every single person in your

121
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,440
organization interprets

122
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,600
that email differently every single

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,080
person then takes that interpretation

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,199
and over time as they add more

125
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,360
information to that interpretation they

126
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,520
all start going in slightly different

127
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,360
directions so even if from that one

128
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,720
email everybody ended up going in the

129
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,160
same direction they start to fragment

130
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,680
and you end up with chaos cuz you've got

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,400
loads of different people pulling the

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,800
organization in different

133
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:04,120
directions so in order to create that

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,240
we're moving in this direction just like

135
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,919
the the the the the goals for uh what

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,400
direction are we taking the product what

137
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,520
are we actually building we also need

138
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,199
goals on what do we want what do we want

139
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,560
our our organizational culture to look

140
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,319
like how are we measuring people in

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,720
order to get them to go in that

142
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:27,919
direction uh a great great um joke in

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,360
that space is if you if you give

144
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:35,000
developers a bonus for the number of

145
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,759
bugs that they find in fix in their code

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,039
all of your developers will end up

147
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,680
writing themselves a very large bonus

148
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,039
right because they can just go add uh

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
the problem that they can then fix and

150
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,160
get the qos for fixing it if if you

151
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,520
reward firefighters you breed arsonists

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,400
right if it's within that same uh the

153
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,240
same package so what what what you need

154
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,879
to do instead is you need to look at how

155
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,520
are we measuring and incen izing people

156
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,520
right because the measures and

157
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,280
incentives that you create in your

158
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,080
organization are the things that drive

159
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,720
behaviors we think it's the goals that

160
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,960
we created over here right but if your

161
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,599
measures and incentives are at odds to

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,199
the goals it's going to start pulling

163
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,400
people in a different direction pulling

164
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,879
them in a way that does something

165
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
different pulling them perhaps in the

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,080
opposite direction because you've not

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,639
actually change the system the measures

168
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,199
and incentives are part of the system

169
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,440
within which everybody's operating so

170
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:39,560
you need to focus on how do

171
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,080
we understand how those measures are

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,039
impacting on people's behaviors and

173
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,199
continuously tweak those measures in

174
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,000
order to maintain the direction and

175
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,360
people working together towards that

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,759
goal and communicate everything

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,639
effectively you can't just say to

178
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,240
everybody we're going to do something

179
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,840
new no you have to change the measures

180
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
so they can see that we're doing

181
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,639
something new and then you have to

182
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,840
continuously

183
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,639
reinforce what it is we're doing what

184
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,919
direction we're going why we're going

185
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,639
there how they can help how they're

186
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,479
contributing to the story and you

187
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,319
continually build that picture towards

188
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,960
