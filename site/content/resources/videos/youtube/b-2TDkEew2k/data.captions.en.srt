00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,279
I have this picture in my head of Ken

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,400
saying it to me many years ago um just

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,519
enough and no more and I believe in fact

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,400
he actually I think he said that um no

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,680
matter what quantity

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,560
question I ask

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,359
him the answer is going to be just

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,279
enough and no more doesn't matter what

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,199
the quantity question is right so how

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,679
much backlog should we have just enough

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,719
and no more how many developers should

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,040
we have have just enough and no more how

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,320
much time should we spend on refinement

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,160
just enough and no more same for

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,079
planning upfront that

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:49,239
Mantra of being focused on what it is

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:52,359
we're doing and minimizing our effort

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,760
one of the the um principles in the

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:01:00,120
agile Manifesto is maximizing the amount

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
of work not done
