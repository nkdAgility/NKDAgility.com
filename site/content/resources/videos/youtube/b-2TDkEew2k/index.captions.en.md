I have this picture in my head of Ken saying it to me many years ago: "Just enough and no more." I believe, in fact, he actuallyâ€”I think he said that no matter what quantity question I ask him, the answer is going to be "just enough and no more." It doesn't matter what the quantity question is, right? 

So how much backlog should we have? Just enough and no more. How many developers should we have? Just enough and no more. How much time should we spend on refinement? Just enough and no more. Same for planning upfront. 

That mantra of being focused on what it is we're doing and minimising our effort. One of the principles in the Agile Manifesto is maximising the amount of work not done.
