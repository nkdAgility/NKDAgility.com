# The intention of Agile and Scrum

üîÑ Agile: The Not-So-New Approach to Navigating Complexity üåç

In this compelling video, Martin Hinshelwood shares a historical perspective on Agile, tracing its roots back to pre-industrial times when craftsmanship was personal and customer-centered. He highlights the evolution of work environments through the Industrial Revolution, the impact of Taylorism, and how Agile resurfaced to reconnect us with social and human aspects of work. 

Martin explains how early Agile practices, like XP and Scrum, aimed to help businesses thrive in complexity, and why today‚Äôs challenges, particularly a lack of competence and the commercial dilution of Agile, are causing a reset in the industry. Gain insights into how businesses can reignite Agile‚Äôs original intentions to achieve true value delivery and long-term success. üí°
