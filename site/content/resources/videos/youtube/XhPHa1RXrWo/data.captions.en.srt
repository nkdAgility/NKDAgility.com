1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:07,600
agile is not a a a a new thing by any

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:13,000
means what one could absolutely argue

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,279
that is a very old thing um that prior

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,920
to the Industrial Revolution although

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,480
it's not

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,480
totally to do with that but prior to the

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:30,840
Industrial Revolution um things were

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,160
done in uh small uh H Mom and Pop uh uh

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,719
uh shops all over all over the world

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,640
right your your local cobbler made your

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,960
shoes and your local cobbler understood

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,320
fundamentally your needs as an

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,399
individual because they knew who you

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,120
were they knew who you were they knew

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:52,120
your life story and they created Goods

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,719
just for you um and as we kind of kind

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,879
of scaled up we lost that human

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,480
connection between things and and a lot

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,040
of people blame uh uh Frederick Winslow

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,119
Taylor right talk about taylorism I do

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,920
as well um he he's not strictly at fa it

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,000
wasn't his

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,000
intent uh uh uh to dehumanize the work

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,840
environment it was just the outcome of

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,479
of the practices that he pushed and how

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:24,799
they were they were interpreted right um

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:29,680
so agile's a thing that has always been

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,240
true for most of human existence that

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
the way you get stuff done is you figure

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,600
it out you don't know how to do

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
something you go try some stuff and

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,119
figure out what works best and what

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,560
doesn't and ultimately it's an

34
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,799
evolutionary story because the people in

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,399
the world that were able to do things

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,880
better perhaps survived and those that

37
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,880
were not able to do it did not those

38
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,240
that adapted to farming and new farm

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,399
equipment and were able to to increase

40
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,439
the yield of the crop um they prospered

41
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,159
those that

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,799
weren't able to do that or couldn't

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,599
figure it out did not right that that's

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:13,040
that's fundamentally how evolutionary

45
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,840
theory and how um humans interacting um

46
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,319
with the world around us if we're

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,640
successful we're if if we do well at

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,519
something we're successful if we don't

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,560
do well we're not so agile's not a new

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:32,000
thing but um even as far back as the

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:35,879
kind of kind of 1900s late 1900s um they

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,440
were talking about harnessing the

53
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:43,920
aspects of of of people the so social

54
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,440
aspects of work in order to maximize the

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,800
ability for us to deliver value um and

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,680
if you want to go look up some of the

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,480
the the theory and stories around that

58
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:58,120
it's Maryanne fet you want to be looking

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,360
up um she was a a contemporary and

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,400
perhaps a little bit in opposition of

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,519
Frederick winow Taylor at the time um

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,319
and her stuff was largely lost by the by

63
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,000
the

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,560
1930s but there was really a Resurgence

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,280
of this idea right this fundament that's

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,400
the thing with good

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,720
ideas is they'll keep coming back even

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,000
if we forget

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,000
them um and in the '90s

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,159
XP came along in the software world

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,120
because it was it was very obvious that

72
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,400
um it it wasn't working right we

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,640
actually weren't able to to successfully

74
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,519
and repeatedly build high quality

75
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,400
valuable products without copious

76
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,120
amounts of waste um we had lots of uh

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,080
unhappy people I think Ken wber talks

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,840
about it as hateful work right the work

79
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,760
was hateful we we hated the companies we

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,319
worked for um we hated the work that we

81
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,959
were doing the managers hated the work

82
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,200
that they were doing it everybody just

83
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,319
hat cuz we were dealing with complexity

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,400
and everything would always go wrong

85
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:11,840
right because we're trying to control it

86
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,120
and when you try and control chaos much

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,799
like a lion tamer uh you might you might

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,919
get eaten and in fact the likelihood is

89
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,280
that you're going to get eaten at some

90
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,360
point if you keep trying to do it that

91
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,400
way and that happened in in Project

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,680
after project after project um when I

93
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,199
started out in the software industry

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,400
right when I graduated University and

95
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,520
started out in the software industry um

96
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,080
there was talk of this idea of a project

97
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,800
called a Death March and a death march

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,680
project is a project that every single

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:49,199
person on it already understands before

100
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,840
we hard we've hardly started uh the

101
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
project and everybody already

102
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,039
understands that is Dead on Arrival

103
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,759
right it's not going anywhere it's not

104
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,400
going to be successful we're not going

105
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,919
to be able to do this it's not going to

106
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
cost what they think it's going to cost

107
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,520
it's not going to be done in that time

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,360
it's not going to have the features that

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,960
they think it's going to have Death

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,960
March um but we have to do it anyway cuz

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,919
that's what we're paid to do and

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,400
somebody bean counter higher up in the

113
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,520
organization has made the decision so

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,080
the the the this Resurgence um that kind

115
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,400
of culminated in the 90s with XP right

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
that was really the the start of the

117
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,720
bigger Resurgence although it had been

118
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,160
been mulling around before that and then

119
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,759
scrum um eventually culminated in the AO

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Manifesto in 2001

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,080
and the the manifesto

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,039
really codified a little bit that's

123
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,039
probably too strong a word but

124
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,400
def how' to describe it I would I would

125
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,960
say it defined the principles right but

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,600
that's probably too strong codified the

127
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,840
principles suggested some principles for

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:58,280
a new way of working one that focused on

129
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,800
dealing with complexity and the unknown

130
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,120
with empathy and with connection to

131
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,960
people right bringing that social aspect

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:14,599
that that maryan fet wrote about nearly

133
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:16,599
100 years 100 years before so um that's

134
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,240
really what the

135
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:24,039
intention of agile

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,680
was however it was kind of predicated

137
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,280
right on

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,160
competence the the the the the there was

139
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,080
an assumption

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,599
of the inherent craftsmanship and

141
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,960
competence of the

142
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,840
participants that we're we were going to

143
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,880
build on um however the demand

144
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:48,919
especially like I graduated University

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,479
in 2000 first job 2001 is um and the

146
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,960
demand for engineers for product

147
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,000
managers for

148
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,919
leaders um that had the both the

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,120
competence and understood some of this

150
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,680
new way new way of working that we were

151
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,840
trying to maximize the value of of what

152
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,120
we're getting far far outstripped the

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,639
supply in in the market and really it

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,479
still does and part of the reason it

155
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,199
still does is we didn't focus on

156
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,000
competence of who we needed to do the to

157
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,520
do to do to do these things to make

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,919
these changes to fundamentally support

159
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,680
them from a from a leadership

160
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,039
perspective from an engineering

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,759
perspective from a from a from our goals

162
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,520
and Discovery and what direction we're

163
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,280
going perspective right that's Engineers

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,199
product managers and and and

165
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,560
leaders and because we didn't focus on

166
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,800
that level of competence it's largely

167
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,680
starting to fall

168
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,720
apart right um that that that

169
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,720
realization it's like the the the it's

170
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
not quite like the dot bubble bursting

171
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,120
that was a money thing this is a

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,199
competence thing this is this

173
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,680
is of

174
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,599
the hundreds of thousands of people that

175
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,440
are currently in roles where they're

176
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,400
expected to either uh participate

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,599
in

178
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,599
craft or um o over overview oversee

179
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,800
probably oversee is the wrong word right

180
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,800
but but um lead

181
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,039
right the the level the level of of

182
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,519
competence is a tiny percentage of

183
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,360
people in in that in that space right it

184
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,360
it's it's starting to show in

185
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,959
organizations where organizations are

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,519
looking

187
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,440
for they're looking

188
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,560
for what are we getting for our money

189
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,519
because we're paying perhaps a lot of

190
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,200
high price salaries for for for for

191
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,320
engineers for product managers for for

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,640
leadership um we're not getting we're

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,560
not getting the return on investment

194
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,760
that we're expecting and we kind of need

195
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,519
to get the return on investment

196
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,360
otherwise it's not worth spending that

197
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:07,440
money that's how business functions

198
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,279
right in in in uh in our world so if we

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,040
can't justify the cost we're going to

200
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,920
have to get rid of the the the the thing

201
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,800
that's costing us and that that at the

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,000
moment is people and it's what it's

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,959
looking like is kind of not the

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,079
engineers and not the the product

205
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,240
managers um but it's the it's the

206
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:30,399
leaders it's the the the scrum Masters

207
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,160
the coaches the uh

208
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:38,279
those those folks that just don't

209
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,600
necessarily have the level of competence

210
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,920
that's demanded to fulfill the role and

211
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,240
be successful I think that's the way I

212
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,120
would describe it to fulfill the role

213
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,000
and be

214
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,000
successful um they maybe had enough to

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,880
convince the people that were hiring

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,480
them that didn't necessarily understand

217
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,680
what they needed that that's that that's

218
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,720
that they they could do it but as it

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,680
turns out they they they couldn't do it

220
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,519
um yeah it's it's

221
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,839
it's systemic at the moment and that's

222
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,800
what we're seeing in the industry

223
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,200
there's a there's a wide wide ranging

224
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,880
General

225
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,920
reset of our understanding of what these

226
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,000
things are um what are the competencies

227
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,760
that are

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,399
required and most people are coming up

229
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,360
lacking

230
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:33,920
um so that's kind of

231
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,160
what we intended to do when we were

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,160
originally talking about agile back in

233
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,480
2001 I I just started so I'm uh uh

234
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,680
commenting on what what they were

235
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,079
thinking at the time um but the outcome

236
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,200
has not been that it's been a

237
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:57,560
commercialized uh watered down lip

238
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,880
service um based based result and that's

239
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,880
where we're at right now
