1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,679
in order to be successful organizations

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,320
need trust and Trust comes from the

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,719
virtue of

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,880
patience your organization needs

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,680
patience and tolerance with the people

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,519
in the organization who are doing the

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,800
best they can within the context that

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,240
they have and hopefully trying to create

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,599
the best possible product if they're

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,279
trying to create the best possible

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,239
product um and something goes wrong

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,480
there's a failure um things don't go

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,360
like we expect or we create something

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,079
that doesn't look like we

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,440
expect sometimes that's just a fact of

16
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,360
life right not everything's going to go

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,920
the way you want it not all of the

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,840
outcomes are going to be what you want

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,640
everything that we create when we're

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,280
building products is something that may

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,039
or may not work out may or may not be

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,399
successful um and we're we're taking a

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
BET right we're saying we think this

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,720
feature this capability is going to be

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,960
successful or we think these practices

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,960
are going to work for us as we're trying

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,840
to do things in the organization we

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,880
think this new tool is going to work and

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,840
we don't know any of those things are

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,840
true until we actually get to the end of

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,200
that process or at least someway through

32
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,520
that process and we have something

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
usable that we can validate um with our

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,119
with our customers with our us ERS with

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,640
our with in our world um to be able to

36
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:42,280
um create good outcomes so businesses

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,119
need to be patient with teams leaders

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,360
need to be patient with people um

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,840
product owners need to be patient with

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,960
the product right with the people that

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,520
are building stuff in the product are we

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,399
getting to where we need to go if we get

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,159
um uh

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,920
frustrated and create a blame cult

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,520
within our organization we are not going

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,960
to be successful cuz we're going to

47
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,920
erode the trust that is the foundation

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,640
to empiricism and one of the key things

49
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,519
we need to build trust is patience if
