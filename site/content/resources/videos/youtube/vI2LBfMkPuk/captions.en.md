My favourite agile course to deliver is the applying professional scrum class and it's my favourite class to deliver because I think it generates some of the greatest epiphanies for students.

So in that class we actually practice scrum and that's different from all the other classes as well. 

We do four sprints. I've been adopting Minecraft in these sprints. 

We break everybody up into teams. We do a sprint straight off the bat. 

The reason we do the first thing we do is a sprint is that people use the techniques they're used to in organising when they do the first sprint. 

So there's this huge realisation at the end of the first sprint about how chaotic it was and how difficult the process was. There are people in the classroom that have never used or played a game before, let alone Minecraft. 

That simulates that real-world experience of when you get onto a brand new product or a brand new project and you've got no idea what's next. 

You get no idea what you need to do. You've got no idea who you need to speak to. You've got no idea who the customer is. I'm trying to figure that out. 

That first sprint demonstrates the chaotic is not the right word. It just generates, I don't know, the cluster of that first moment when you start working on a product or project. 

In the real world, that can last for an incredibly long time. 

Right, because there's who comes in and tells everybody how they're supposed to do stuff. At some point, maybe a project manager gets hired or a project manager is there and they manage to get around everybody, but it's generally chaos. 

So then we go into teaching them scrum. 

We have a kind of, I guess it's two half days. We're going to teach them scrum, but the first part of the first half day is the sprint and the second part of the second half day is another sprint. 

So we teach some scrum in between and then they go into that second sprint with that knowledge of here's how we're going to organise all the stuff we do in order to try and control the chaos and figure out what it is we're going to do going forward. 

They do planning, they have a conversation, they agree what they're going to do. 

That doesn't always happen, but they have that agreement. They have those check-ins. They have that reflection at the end and they themselves, that's the second epiphany moment for the students, is they realise what it is that they're there for. 

They realise what scrum is trying to achieve. They realise the benefit they could get from it in the real world.
