1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,400
my favorite agile course to deliver is

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,660
the applying

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,039
professional scrum class and it's my

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,680
favorite class to deliver because I

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,980
think it generates some of the greatest

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,900
epiphanies for for for students

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,060
so in that class we actually practice

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,800
scrum and that that's different from all

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,460
the other classes as well

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,700
so we do four sprints

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,620
um I've been adopting Minecraft

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,140
in in these sprints

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,280
uh so the the we break everybody up into

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,600
teams uh we do a Sprint straight off the

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
bat

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,800
and the reason we do the first thing we

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,160
do is a Sprint is that people use the

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,020
techniques they're used to in organizing

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,539
when they do the first print

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,880
so there's this huge realization at the

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,700
end of the first Sprint about how

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,040
chaotic it was and how difficult the

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,520
process was there are people in the

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,460
classroom that have never used

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,420
played a game before let alone Minecraft

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,460
and that simulates that Real World

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,380
experience of when you get onto a brand

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,119
new product or a brand new project and

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,740
you've you've got no idea what's next

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,420
you get no idea what you need to do

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,100
you've got no idea who you need to speak

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,820
to you've got no idea who the customer

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,380
is I'm trying to figure that out and

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,479
that that for Sprint demonstrates

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,939
the chaotic is not the right word it

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,299
just it generates I don't know the

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,280
cluster [Â __Â ] of uh at that first moment

38
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,259
when you start working on a product or

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,780
project and

40
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,100
in the real world that can last for an

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,680
incredibly long time

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,780
right because there's there's who comes

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,399
in and tells everybody how they're

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,200
supposed to do stuff at some point maybe

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
a project manager gets hired or a

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,799
project manager is there and they manage

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,380
to get around everybody but it's

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,300
generally chaos so then we go into

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,080
teaching them scrum

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,660
and we have a a kind of I guess it's two

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,340
two half days we're gonna teach them

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,959
scrum but the first part of the first

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,819
half day is the Sprint and the second

54
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,400
part of the second half day is another

55
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,440
Sprint so we teach some scrum in between

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,060
and then they go into that second Sprint

57
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,340
with that knowledge of here's how are we

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,959
we're going to organize all the stuff we

59
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,120
do in order to try and Control the Chaos

60
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,519
and figure out what it is we're going to

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,500
do do going forward and and they do

62
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,900
planning they have a conversation they

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,540
agree what they're going to do then you

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,980
know that doesn't always happen but they

65
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,319
have that agreement they have those

66
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,260
check-ins they have that reflection at

67
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,879
the end and they themselves what that's

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,879
the second Epiphany moment for the

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:05,459
students is they realize

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,620
what it is that that they're there for

71
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,019
right they realize what scrum is trying

72
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,640
to achieve they realize the benefit they

73
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,640
could get from it in the real world
