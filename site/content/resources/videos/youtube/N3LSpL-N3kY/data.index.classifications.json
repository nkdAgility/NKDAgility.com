There are no direct or indirect mentions of Objective Key Results (OKRs) as a goal-setting framework, nor does the content address OKR theory, practice, strategic intent, or implementation. Discussions focus on course experience, Agile learning processes, and assessment, rather than on measurable objectives or results in the OKR sense. Some reference to 'objectives' exists insofar as learning goals, but not in the context or definition required for classification as OKR-related material.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on comparing the formats of Product Owner courses (2-day vs. 8-week) in terms of learning pace and style, without direct mention of Agentic Engineering or its concepts. The text lacks discussion of developer/AI agency, systemic observability, DevOps ethos, or ethical autonomy. There is minimal conceptual overlap and no depth on engineering philosophy or practices related to agency. While targeting Agile practitioners (somewhat aligned audience), the content is centered on course selection rather than engineering decisions, feedback loops, or autonomy principles. Final confidence reflects low but not zero thematic overlap due to the mention of feedback in practical learning.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on comparing Product Owner course lengths and learning outcomes but does not discuss Agentic Engineering, developer/AI agency, or related practices. Its main purpose is course selection in Agile, resulting in very low confidence for category alignment.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on comparing delivery formats for Product Owner training (2-day vs 8-week), emphasizing learning pace, feedback, practical application, and skills integration. While it references feedback loops and integration of learning into real scenarios, it does so only in a general context of education and skill development—not in a software delivery, agentic, or AI-augmented context. There is no mention of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, agentic principles, nor delivery frameworks involving agents or AI. The audience is primarily aspiring or current Product Owners rather than those focused on AI-driven agentic delivery. No obsolete practices or negative tone noted, so no penalties were applied.",
