So the core value of the product owner class is that the core value of the learning. Right, you're going to learn a bunch of stuff about the product owner, how it works, what it isn't, what it is. You're going to get an assessment where you're able to hopefully pass that assessment and get a credential. 

Um, that's really the core value proposition: understanding the product owner, perhaps getting the credential, and looking forward into where do I learn things next. 

Um, the added value of the eight-week class is actually being able to connect the things that we're talking about in the class back to your real-world organization, try and practice some of those things, and then get feedback on it on a regular basis. So instead of two full days, it's eight weekly four-hour sessions.
