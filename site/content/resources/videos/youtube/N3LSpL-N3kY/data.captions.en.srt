1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,160
so the co the core value of the product

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,560
owner class is that the the the the the

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,240

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,080
stuff about the product owner how it

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,240
works what it isn't what it is you're

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,160
going to get an assessment where you're

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
able to hopefully pass that assessment

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,820
and get a credential

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,220
um that's really the core value

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,779
proposition is understanding the product

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,880
owner

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,619
perhaps getting the credential and

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
looking forward into where do I learn

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,520
things next

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,680
um the added value of the eight week

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,020
class is actually being able to connect

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,160
the things that we're talking about in

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,280
the class back to your real world

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,860
organization try and practice some of

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
those things and then get feedback on it

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,680
on a regular basis so instead of two

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
full days it's eight weekly four-hour

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
sessions
