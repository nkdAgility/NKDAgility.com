    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly covers hiring Agile coaches, focusing on their traits, track record, and cultural fit for Agile transformations. There are no direct mentions or substantive discussion of AI agents, autonomy, agentic integration, or contextual intelligence. The focus is on human expertise and traditional coaching, not agentic or AI-driven delivery. The intended audience (Agile leaders/practitioners) aligns to some extent, as those interested in Agentic Software Delivery may also hire coaches, but the intent, substance, and language remain exclusively non-agentic. There is a high signal-to-noise ratio, but almost zero conceptual or technical overlap with Agentic Software Delivery as defined. Scores are accordingly extremely low, resulting in minimal overall confidence.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content focuses exclusively on selecting Agile coaches for transformation, with no discussion of AI agents or agentic software delivery. There is almost no overlap with the category; fit is minimal and limited to audience similarity.",
