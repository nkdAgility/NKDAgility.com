1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,360
one of the signs of the agile apocalypse

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,960
is

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,760
silence quite often this

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,680
manifests uh in your Sprint reviews when

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,039
you're trying to get engagement from

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,039
stakeholders perhaps you can't even get

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,760
your stakeholders to turn up when they

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,679
do turn up you ask them for any feedback

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,840
in a tumble weed floats past and that's

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,280
all the feedback you get perhaps when

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,600
you ask for feedback you already know

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,280
before you ask that question that which

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,559
person uh the the usually the the

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,039
loudest um and most outgoing person you

15
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,239
know they're the one that's going to

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,520
answer that question and nobody else's

17
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:56,840
feedback is going to be offered because

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,399
they don't want to because they would

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,519
be I don't know sometimes there's

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,039
there's there's a a little there's fear

21
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,799
if you're in a room with a lot of other

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,759
people that your feedback is going to be

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,119
invalid um there's fear that somebody

24
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,040
else in the room might have a different

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,960
idea than your idea and they might be

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,680
more senior and you don't want to step

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,840
on their toes by offering feedback that

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,880
perhaps goes in the wrong direction so

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,880
it's very difficult to get that feedback

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,720
break the silence and get people to

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
actually talk about your products talk

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,240
about the direction of your products

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,799
talk about more than just the features

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,640
that you've built even what are the

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,560
things that the stakeholders that you

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,320
have in the room understand about the

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
the the the business and the business

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,159
choices that have happened since your

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,520
last Sprint review what does the

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,399
stakeholders understand that we maybe

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
don't understand about the market

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,680
opportunities that are presenting

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,399
themselves that since the last time we

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
had a Sprint review or that have been

45
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,039
manifesting over a period of time and

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,399
and suddenly they're they become

47
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:10,640
important this is all part of that North

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,840
Star that direction as well as trying to

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,920
break that cone of silence so we have

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,040
good communication quite often another

51
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,280
way that silence manifests is all of the

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,519
stakeholders that do turn up

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
know they know that they can go have a

54
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,120
private chat with the product owner

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,319
later and get their agenda heard and

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,480
they can beat that product owner into

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,879
doing things differently than they know

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,959
other people in the room want to do

59
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,800
things or other people in the room know

60
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,280
that some other direction is more

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,400
important to the business so they want

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,640
to go browbeat that product owner

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
privately so that they can get their

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
agenda rather than the whole

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,519
organizational agenda cuz that makes

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,280
them look good not the other people in

67
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,440
the organization we don't care about

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,360
them right so how how do you do how do

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,720
you create break that silence and get

70
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,920
that engagement from people you need to

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,720
stop uh uh building the wrong thing

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,000
right if you're building the wrong thing

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
stakeholders ain't going to turn up I

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,879
was working with a team in Norway and

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,440
the product owner didn't even turn up

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
for the Sprint reviews how do you think

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,480
the team felt about the work that they

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,920
were doing and the value that it

79
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,200
provided to the business so what did

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,799
they pick at their Sprint planning

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,239
whatever they felt like and they thought

82
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,920
was cool to work on because nobody

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,400
cares so we may as well come up and care

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,560
about the cool things we're working on

85
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,280
right rather than working on the right

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,680
things working on the things that they

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
thought was cool that's not who should

88
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,080
be making those decisions those

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
decisions should be informed decisions

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,799
they're still making the decision about

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,000
what it is they work on but H what

92
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,280
bounds what context are they making that

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,760
decision making it based on what's cool

94
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,280
for them to work on or what's right for

95
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,200
the business and supporting the

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,680
customers and the overall strategic

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,120
direction of the product so that Silence

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,200
has created that

99
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,360
that lack of Engagement lack of care in

100
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,840
the product and if you do get people

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,519
stakeholders to turn up build something

102
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,799
they care about that's how you get them

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,880
in there ask them to come to offer

104
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,320
advice stop having those side

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,479
conversations right product you're going

106
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,600
to have side conversations but you

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,680
product owners know the conversations

108
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,160
that I'm talking about those site

109
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,759
conversations where you know you're

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,560
going to get brow beaten where

111
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,840
somebody's just going to be spouting

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,360
their agenda not the organizational

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,400
agenda instead of having those meetings

114
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,759
in private bring those discussions bring

115
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,080
those topics into the Sprint review

116
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,600
where you've got more voices to be heard

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,680
that the gastal can look critically on

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,080
that idea of let's serve this one part

119
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,280
of the business at detriment of the rest

120
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,360
and they can say no that's not a good

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,800
idea because it's going to have this

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,680
impact and have that

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,720
work for you rather than against you so

124
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,840
build up those ideas have those

125
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,360
conversations during the Sprint review

126
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,199
break big groups down into small groups

127
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,960
I was recently at a Sprint review and 60

128
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,280
people turned up right there's 60 people

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,919
at the Sprint review uh Lots it was

130
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,400
quite a big team right Lots of teams

131
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
working on the same product so a lot of

132
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,880
them were team members but when they

133
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,680
asked for feedback there was maybe two

134
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,360
people that spoke the 60 people in the

135
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,400
room why would you bother having 60

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
people in the room if you didn't want to

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,919
hear from 60 people in the room that you

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,680
didn't want a collaborative experience

139
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,199
with 60 people in the room so do

140
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,919
breakout rooms use liberating structures

141
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,919
send people out to do small parts of

142
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,039
that story perhaps take some stuff off

143
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,560
the product backlog that you think might

144
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,720
not be right and give little assignments

145
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
out to smaller groups to go figure out

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,240
what we could do better and what we

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,319
could do next and then bring it back

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,759
and bring make it into a more cohesive

149
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,960
story it's all sorts of things you can

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,080
do to break that cone of silence around

151
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,199
value around Direction around what we're

152
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,800
actually doing um discuss budgets and

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,919
release schedules every every body on

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,560
the team everybody working on the

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,479
product everybody working with the

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,080
product should understand those things

157
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,639
because they will impact on the

158
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,680
decisions that we make we want people to

159
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,039
make the best decisions possible not be

160
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,800
making decisions within that cone of

161
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,039
silence we're not going to talk about

162
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,440
anything so make sure that you don't

163
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,479
have silence on your teams that you

164
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,120
engage with people product owners this

165
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,039
