title: Overcoming the Ghost of Agile Certifications
short_title: Overcoming the Ghost of Agile Certifications
description: Explores the limits of Agile certifications, emphasising real-world experience, continuous learning, and team validation over credentials for true professional growth.
tldr: Agile certifications are often overvalued and can distract from real learning and practical experience; passing an exam does not make someone an expert or guarantee they can deliver value. True capability comes from hands-on work, team recognition, and continuous learning, not just credentials. Development managers should prioritize real-world skills and team impact over certifications when hiring or developing Agile professionals.

In the world of Agile, certifications have long been a point of contention. Lately, there's been a growing trend of dismissiveness toward certifications, with many expressing skepticism about their value. As someone who has spent years in the Agile and [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) space, I understand the frustration that certifications often evoke. While I agree with some of the criticism, I also see their value, but only when approached correctly.

## **The Impact of Certifications on Learning**

Certifications have had a significant impact on the Agile industry. However, they often get in the way of learning. Here's the challenge: people tend to chase certifications instead of pursuing the deep knowledge that those certifications are meant to assess. It‚Äôs common to see individuals land jobs solely because of the letters on their resume, not because they have the real-world experience needed to excel.

But this raises the question: What‚Äôs the true value of certifications, and how should we approach them?

### **The Trap of Chasing Credentials**

- **Certifications don‚Äôt equal capability** ‚Äì Too often, people equate passing a certification exam with being proficient in Agile or Scrum. This is a dangerous assumption.

- **Jobs over skills** ‚Äì Many people secure positions based on their certifications rather than their ability to deliver real value.

- **Learning gets left behind** ‚Äì When the focus shifts to acquiring a certificate, the pursuit of deep knowledge often takes a back seat.

As Agile professionals, we must recognize this and steer the industry toward valuing experience and learning over mere certification.

## **Certifications as a Starting Point**

Let me be clear: there is no two-day course you can attend, pass a certification exam, and walk away as an expert. At best, a certification can be likened to passing your driving test. Think back to the time when you passed your driving test‚Äîwere you the best driver on the road at that moment? Absolutely not. You had the _minimum_ knowledge required to avoid being a danger to those around you. And, if we‚Äôre honest, even that minimum wasn‚Äôt enough for some of us!

Here‚Äôs the key takeaway: **Certifications are just the beginning, not the end.** They represent a starting point in your journey, not the pinnacle of your expertise.

### **Think of It Like Driving**

- **Driving test ‚â† expert driver** ‚Äì Just because you passed your driving test doesn‚Äôt mean you can handle every vehicle or every road condition.

- **Different licenses, different skills** ‚Äì Passing a driving test doesn‚Äôt mean you can ride a motorbike or drive a 10-ton truck. The same applies to Agile certifications‚Äîone size does not fit all.

If you‚Äôve recently earned a certification, think of it as your learner‚Äôs permit in the Agile world. It‚Äôs the start of a long journey toward true mastery.

## **The Misuse of Certifications in the Professional World**

Now, here's where certifications become problematic. In the professional world, we often see certifications misused as badges of expertise. But here‚Äôs the hard truth: passing a certification doesn‚Äôt make you an expert. It doesn‚Äôt automatically qualify you as a [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) or an Agile Coach, and if you‚Äôre putting those titles on your LinkedIn profile after passing an exam, it‚Äôs time for a reality check.

### **Real-World Examples**

I‚Äôve met some of the best Scrum Masters, and guess what? They didn‚Äôt become Scrum Masters after a certification course. They became Scrum Masters because their teams saw the value they brought and selected them for the role. These individuals demonstrated their effectiveness in the team context, long before they attended a Scrum course.

So, if you‚Äôre new to the Scrum Master role, don‚Äôt be in a rush to slap that title on your profile. Instead, focus on building your real-world skills and experiences.

## **Becoming a Scrum Master: The Right Way**

If you‚Äôre aspiring to become a Scrum Master, certifications are just one piece of the puzzle. The real key is proving your value within a team. You need to demonstrate that you‚Äôre capable of enhancing the team‚Äôs effectiveness and adding tangible value to their work.

### **How to Earn Your Place as a Scrum Master:**

- **Join a team** ‚Äì Start by being part of a team that can benefit from the skills you already have.

- **Demonstrate value** ‚Äì Show your team that you‚Äôre not just there for a title. Help them improve, work more effectively, and achieve their goals.

- **Let the team select you** ‚Äì The best Scrum Masters are selected by their teams, not appointed after a course.

In the end, becoming a Scrum Master is about _earning_ the role through action, not just passing a test.

## **Overcoming the Agile Certification Ghost**

If certifications are haunting your Agile journey, it‚Äôs time to address them. These "ghosts" can undermine the effectiveness of your work and stifle your growth as a professional. While certifications aren‚Äôt inherently bad, they become problematic when used as the sole measure of [competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}).

### **How to Exorcise the Certification Ghosts:**

- **Focus on learning** ‚Äì Shift your focus away from just earning certifications and toward deep learning and experience.

- **Get hands-on** ‚Äì Engage with teams, solve real-world problems, and practice the principles you‚Äôve learned.

- **Seek mentorship** ‚Äì Find experienced Scrum Masters or Agile Coaches who can guide you and provide valuable insights beyond the textbook.

Don‚Äôt let these certification phantoms haunt your career! Certifications should support your learning, not replace it.
