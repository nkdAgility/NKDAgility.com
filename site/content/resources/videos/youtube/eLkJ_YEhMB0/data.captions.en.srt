1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,360
one of the ghosts it's actually two of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,360
the ghosts of agile past are the three

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,360
questions you might have heard of the

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,199
three questions in relation to the Daily

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,840
scrum what did I do yesterday what am I

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,320
doing today and What's blocking me or

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,119
you might be thinking of the

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,759
retrospective what went well what didn't

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,279
go well what do we need to to to change

10
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:35,239
right or um there's various Renditions

11
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,680
of the three questions CU three must be

12
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:43,320
a good number U but the reality is that

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,640
if you've got a scrum team and you do

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,640
the three questions once maybe a couple

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,239
of times either at your your daily or at

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,920
your Sprint review then that's probably

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,559
okay right there's nothing fundamentally

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,199
wrong with the three questions but what

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,879
is

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,360
dysfunctional what is that ghost of

21
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:11,920
agile past is when the three questions

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,600
become the purpose of the daily or the

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,439
purpose of the retrospective and you'll

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,680
see that on teams they'll come into the

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,920
daily scrum and they will um go into

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,720
autopilot it becomes a rote procedure

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,400
for them to follow that they each need

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,119
to answer the three questions and you'll

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,159
perhaps see the project manager sorry

30
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,880
scrum Master writing down the answers to

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,200
those three questions so they can go

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,040
update their project plan that is not

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
the purpose of the daily certainly not

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,960
the purpose uh of the Retro with the

35
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,880
other three questions you need to be

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,680
focused on the value that we're

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,079
delivering and is that value moving

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,840
towards the outcome that we're trying to

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,920
achieve we're trying to be successful at

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,920
delivering on the Sprint goal and

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,880
potentially other stuff in the Sprint um

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
and are we making progress towards that

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,440
are we are we blocked with that as a

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,080
group so what I tend to see as a more

45
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,360
eff way to move forward is for teams to

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,200
focus on the value in the Sprint we we

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
don't need to hear from everybody right

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,319
if Bob is working on the same task for

49
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,000
three days in a row it's boring to hear

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,800
from Bob and really adds no value there

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
might be a good reason why Bob is stuck

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,640
on that task for three Sprints in a row

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,280
right but that or three days in a row

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,959
but that doesn't mean that's how we want

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,040
to um uh surface that during the the the

56
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
the Sprint the daily scrum because most

57
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,400
people in the room don't really care

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,200
right it's not part of their uh uh uh uh

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,239
thought process but what you could do is

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,400
focus on the value that's being

61
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,680
delivered what is the next most

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,120
important piece of value that we need to

63
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,519
deliver how are we doing with it well uh

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,200
Bob and Brenda and Billy are all working

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,120
together on this item and Brenda

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,040
provides uh an update for the for the

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,280
team on how how we're doing on that

68
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,640
right as as a group how are we doing

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,920
that might be a better way to proceed

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,599
you've just one person spoken one piece

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,519
of value and three people are uh have

72
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,319
been working together on that particular

73
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:34,360
item or perhaps um focusing on the value

74
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,159
you might be thinking about which of

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,760
these items on the board have not

76
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,000
moved in a long time right what are we

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,840
forgetting in our daily that's something

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,040
to look at how old are these eyes

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,560
something getting too old on this board

80
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,959
uh you've maybe seen if you Google uh

81
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,760
banana peel uh uh uh daily um work item

82
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,319
aging with with banana peels you'll see

83
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,319
a board with stickies on it and bananas

84
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,040
actual real banana peels stuck to it um

85
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,560
and the more Brown the banana peel gets

86
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,959
the more fruit flies there are flying

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,599
around uh than the older that item has

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,040
been and let's deal with it before the

89
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,359
fruit flies come out now that's just an

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,840
arbitrary silly visual indication but

91
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,360
the reality is the longer things are

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
stuck in your

93
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,560
system the longer things are stuck there

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,639
the longer they're going to take right I

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,000
I mean I'm the the exponentially longer

96
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,199
they're going to take the longer they're

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,759
in there um and that's based on the data

98
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,919
right you can go collect that data look

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,440
at that data monitor the flow through

100
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,800
your system and you'll see that um very

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,120
much happening things that get stuck

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:51,280
tend to get stuck um and if you don't

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,600
have clear rules on uh as a team right

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,720
our team's way of working if you don't

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,199
have a clear consensus on what do we do

106
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,800
about those things uh quite often they

107
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,360
just get left and because they get left

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,039
you end up getting to the end of the

109
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,320
Sprint and there's things you haven't

110
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,280
done and things that haven't moved and

111
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,320
things that get left behind because

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,199
we're not focusing on maximizing the

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,039
value that we're delivering as a team

114
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:22,120
and that is a ghost of agile past the

115
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,560
three questions creating dysfunctional

116
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,240
Behavior where we're not focusing on

117
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,039
value

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,800
delivery if you are being haunted by

119
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,440
these go posts of agil past we can help

120
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,479
exercise them or help you find a

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,039
consultant coach or trainer that can

122
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,160
don't let these Phantoms undermine the

123
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,240
effectiveness of your value delivery and

124
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,280
the longer they linger the more they

125
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,199
will haunt your team's progress send me
