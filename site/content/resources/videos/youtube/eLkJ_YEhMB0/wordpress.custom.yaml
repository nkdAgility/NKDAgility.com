  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In the world of Agile, certifications have long been a point of contention. Lately, there's been a growing trend of dismissiveness toward certifications, with many expressing skepticism about their value. As someone who has spent years in the Agile and Scrum space, I understand the frustration that certifications often evoke. While I agree with some of the criticism, I also see their value, but only when approached correctly.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-impact-of-certifications-on-learning\"><strong>The Impact of Certifications on Learning</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Certifications have had a significant impact on the Agile industry. However, they often get in the way of learning. Here's the challenge: people tend to chase certifications instead of pursuing the deep knowledge that those certifications are meant to assess. It’s common to see individuals land jobs solely because of the letters on their resume, not because they have the real-world experience needed to excel.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But this raises the question: What’s the true value of certifications, and how should we approach them?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-trap-of-chasing-credentials\"><strong>The Trap of Chasing Credentials</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Certifications don’t equal capability</strong> – Too often, people equate passing a certification exam with being proficient in Agile or Scrum. This is a dangerous assumption.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Jobs over skills</strong> – Many people secure positions based on their certifications rather than their ability to deliver real value.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Learning gets left behind</strong> – When the focus shifts to acquiring a certificate, the pursuit of deep knowledge often takes a back seat.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As Agile professionals, we must recognize this and steer the industry toward valuing experience and learning over mere certification.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-certifications-as-a-starting-point\"><strong>Certifications as a Starting Point</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let me be clear: there is no two-day course you can attend, pass a certification exam, and walk away as an expert. At best, a certification can be likened to passing your driving test. Think back to the time when you passed your driving test—were you the best driver on the road at that moment? Absolutely not. You had the <em>minimum</em> knowledge required to avoid being a danger to those around you. And, if we’re honest, even that minimum wasn’t enough for some of us!</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Here’s the key takeaway: <strong>Certifications are just the beginning, not the end.</strong> They represent a starting point in your journey, not the pinnacle of your expertise.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-think-of-it-like-driving\"><strong>Think of It Like Driving</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Driving test ≠ expert driver</strong> – Just because you passed your driving test doesn’t mean you can handle every vehicle or every road condition.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Different licenses, different skills</strong> – Passing a driving test doesn’t mean you can ride a motorbike or drive a 10-ton truck. The same applies to Agile certifications—one size does not fit all.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you’ve recently earned a certification, think of it as your learner’s permit in the Agile world. It’s the start of a long journey toward true mastery.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-misuse-of-certifications-in-the-professional-world\"><strong>The Misuse of Certifications in the Professional World</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now, here's where certifications become problematic. In the professional world, we often see certifications misused as badges of expertise. But here’s the hard truth: passing a certification doesn’t make you an expert. It doesn’t automatically qualify you as a Scrum Master or an Agile Coach, and if you’re putting those titles on your LinkedIn profile after passing an exam, it’s time for a reality check.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-real-world-examples\"><strong>Real-World Examples</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I’ve met some of the best Scrum Masters, and guess what? They didn’t become Scrum Masters after a certification course. They became Scrum Masters because their teams saw the value they brought and selected them for the role. These individuals demonstrated their effectiveness in the team context, long before they attended a Scrum course.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, if you’re new to the Scrum Master role, don’t be in a rush to slap that title on your profile. Instead, focus on building your real-world skills and experiences.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-becoming-a-scrum-master-the-right-way\"><strong>Becoming a Scrum Master: The Right Way</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you’re aspiring to become a Scrum Master, certifications are just one piece of the puzzle.

      Agile certifications are a starting point, not expertise. Focus on
      hands-on learning, team value, and real-world experience over chasing
