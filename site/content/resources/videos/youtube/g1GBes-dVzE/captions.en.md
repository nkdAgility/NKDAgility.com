I think one thing an agile coach must have to be successful is a deep, deep understanding of the processes, practices and tools of the teams that they work with. Those are the technologies that those teams have to use. 

Understanding, being a lean agile practitioner, understanding all of the different flavours. Right now, you don't have to understand them all deeply, but all of the different flavours. What is it that your team is working on? What tools and technologies are they using, and how are they using it? Are they using it well? Do they need help in using it? Do they need to be moved in a different direction? 

Right, agile coaching is about a lot more than just babysitting the team.
