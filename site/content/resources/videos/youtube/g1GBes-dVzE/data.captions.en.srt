00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,880
I think one thing an agile coach must

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:11,700
have to be successful is uh a deep deep

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,420
understanding of the

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,460
um processes practices and tools

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,920
um of the the teams that they work with

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,260
that are the technologies that those

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,820
those those teams that we have to use

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,699
right

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,920
um understanding being a lean agile

10
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,599
practitioner understanding all of the

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,160
different flavors right now you don't

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,200
have to understand them all deeply but

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,820
all of the different flavors what what

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,440
is it that your team is working on what

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,719
tools and Technologies are they using

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,540
and how are they using are they using it

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,239
well do they need help in using it do

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,660
they need moved in a different direction

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:53,539
right agile coaching is about a lot more

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,539
uh than just babysitting the team
