## Why a Deep Understanding is Non-Negotiable

When I talk about the one thing that an Agile Coach must possess to truly excel, I always come back to one point: you must have a deep understanding of the processes, practices, and tools of the teams you work with. Â ðŸ› 

Now, let's expand on that. It's not just about knowing Agile theories and frameworks inside and out; you must delve deeply into the trenches of the actual technologies that your team employs.

Why?

Because you need to understand the technologies the team you're working with must use.Â  ðŸŽ¯

## All the 'Flavours' of Tools and Technologies

Being a lean Agile Practitioner, as I like to call it, means that you should understand and appreciate all the different 'flavours' of tools, practices, and technologies.

Do you have to be an expert in them all? No. But you do need to have a bird's eye view of the different flavours of what your team is working on.

You must ask questions like, What tools and technologies are they using, and how are they using it? Are they using it well, or do they need help using it? Or do they need to be moved in a different direction?

## Agile Coaching is Not Babysitting â€” It's Elevating Teams

Let's set the record straight - Agile Coaching is not, and should never be considered, mere babysitting of the team. Â ðŸŒŸ

It's about guiding, it's about challenging, and yes, it's about pushing the team to break new boundaries. In other words, your role is to make them "advance and improve."
