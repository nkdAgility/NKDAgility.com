Technical debt is a term that often gets thrown around in the tech community, but what does it really mean? As someone who has navigated the complexities of software development for years, I can tell you that technical debt is a significant challenge for organisations. In simple terms, technical debt refers to the future costs incurred when you or your team opt for quick, short-term solutions instead of more robust, long-term approaches. 

### Understanding Technical Debt

- **Knowingly Introduced Debt**: This occurs when you make a conscious choice to prioritise speed over quality. For instance, if you need a feature delivered quickly and decide to implement a workaround that isn’t ideal, you’re knowingly adding to your technical debt.
  
- **Unknowingly Introduced Debt**: Sometimes, decisions made in the past may have seemed sound at the time but become problematic as the system evolves. A classic example is the Azure DevOps team’s initial architectural choices regarding work item tracking. They designed their system with the assumption that no one would need more than 1024 custom fields. Fast forward, and they found themselves needing to refactor their entire system to accommodate the reality of their users’ needs.

### The Real Cost of Technical Debt

Technical debt can manifest in various ways, and it’s crucial to differentiate between actual technical debt and other issues that might be mislabelled as such. For example, writing poor code and shipping it without due diligence isn’t technical debt; it’s simply incompetence. 

In a competent team, we can categorise technical debt into two types:

1. **Known Technical Debt**: This is the debt you’re aware of and have chosen to accept for the sake of expediency.
  
2. **Unknown Technical Debt**: This is the debt that creeps up on you, often as a result of past decisions that seemed reasonable at the time but have since become liabilities.

### The Importance of Paying Back Technical Debt

One of the most significant challenges with technical debt is that it’s not like a traditional debt secured against an asset. If you stop paying your mortgage, the bank can repossess your house. But who is ensuring the quality of your product against technical debt? There’s no safety net; it’s an uninsured risk that you must manage proactively.

I often reflect on the Azure DevOps team’s journey. They transitioned from a waterfall model, shipping updates every two years, to a more agile, continuous delivery model with three-week sprints. This shift revealed the extent of their technical debt, as they faced numerous issues stemming from decisions made during their previous development cycle. 

Over eight years, from 2010 to 2018, they learned the hard way that they needed to pay back their technical debt. By focusing on this, they increased their production from 25 features a year to an impressive 360 features by 2018. 

### Strategies for Managing Technical Debt

Here are some strategies that I’ve found effective in managing and paying back technical debt:

- **Prioritise Refactoring**: Make it a part of your regular development cycle. Allocate time specifically for addressing technical debt.
  
- **Close Feedback Loops**: Shortening feedback loops allows teams to identify and rectify issues more quickly, leading to better decision-making and less accumulated debt.

- **Focus on Quality**: Encourage a culture where quality is paramount. This means not just delivering features but ensuring they are built on a solid foundation.

- **Measure Progress**: Track the number of features delivered and the quality of those features over time. This will help you see the tangible benefits of paying back technical debt.

### Conclusion

In my experience, the value of paying back technical debt cannot be overstated. It’s not just about reducing the burden of past decisions; it’s about enabling your team to deliver more value with the same resources. The Azure DevOps team’s journey is a testament to this. They didn’t set out to deliver more features; they aimed to clean up their processes and systems. Yet, in doing so, they found themselves delivering more than they ever thought possible.

So, let’s stop managing technical debt and start paying it back. The long-term benefits will far outweigh the short-term gains of cutting corners. Embrace the challenge, and you’ll find that a well-maintained system is the key to sustainable success.
