The content's main audience (software practitioners and managers) somewhat overlaps with the likely SLE audience, but the targeting is generic. Discussion depth around SLE is non-existent; the entire work is about technical debt, so intent, alignment, and S/N ratio are all very low for this category. The very modest non-zero scores are only due to a slight overlap in target audience and general discussion of productivity, but there is no justification for assigning any real confidence in a fit to the SLE category.",
