Is the full ecosystem of your project agile? If you've got agile programming teams followed by linear bureaucratic deployment, then that is absolutely a failure. You're probably not very agile. We need more automation to be able to ensure that we can go all the way from your team members creating content to them delivering it to the customers without having bureaucracy and blockages and time in between. We need to shorten those feedback loops and maximize the value that we get for your stakeholders.
