However, it does not mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), either directly or indirectly (e.g., in terms of forecasting timeframes with probabilities or referencing authoritative sources on SLE), nor does it discuss calculating or applying SLE in any sense. Discussion of metrics like cycle time is limited to general Kanban improvements and not tied to the SLE concept as defined in Kanban, Scrum, or Agile theory. Its alignment to the 'Service Level Expectation' category is therefore minimal, but the audience and signal do overlap somewhat since Kanban practitioners are likely to also care about SLE. No penalties are warranted since the content is not critical, satirical, or outdated.

There's substantial discussion dedicated to making work visible and open to improvement, referencing key Kanban practices like visualization, metrics, and continuous improvement. While the main focus is Kanban's transparency and improvement value (rather than a textbook definition of 'Definition of Workflow'), the article consistently elaborates on workflow definition elements: policies, WIP, and explicit agreements about work movement. The intent and advice are highly relevant to Agile practitioners, and signal-to-noise is high, with minimal tangential content. No deductions for tone or obsolescence are necessary. Minor deductions in 'mentions' because although 'Definition of Workflow' is specifically called out, it is only one section among several core Kanban tenets. The audience, intent, and conceptual alignment are strong but not perfect, as the article is practical rather than academic.",
