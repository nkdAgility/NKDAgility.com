It mainly targets teams wanting to optimise workflow using Kanban, situating its advice within the context of Agile but not explicitly within comprehensive application lifecycle management. There is only minimal, tangential alignment: Kanban could be one practice within ALM but is not presented in that context here. Direct mentions are absent; depth in ALM terms is lacking.

There's substantial discussion dedicated to making work visible and open to improvement, referencing key Kanban practices like visualization, metrics, and continuous improvement. While the main focus is Kanban's transparency and improvement value (rather than a textbook definition of 'Definition of Workflow'), the article consistently elaborates on workflow definition elements: policies, WIP, and explicit agreements about work movement. The intent and advice are highly relevant to Agile practitioners, and signal-to-noise is high, with minimal tangential content. No deductions for tone or obsolescence are necessary. Minor deductions in 'mentions' because although 'Definition of Workflow' is specifically called out, it is only one section among several core Kanban tenets. The audience, intent, and conceptual alignment are strong but not perfect, as the article is practical rather than academic.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is highly aligned with 'Definition of Workflow' in Kanban contexts, explicitly addressing workflow visualization, explicit policies, WIP limits, and entry/exit criteria. Its focus on making work visible and supporting continuous improvement makes it an excellent fit for the category.",
