Caman is not a process itself. Caman is a tool that allows you to observe whatever process it is that you're doing. So it provides the metrics, the visualisation, the definition, creating the definition of workflow for whatever process it is you're using. Its primary goal is in creating that additional transparency. It allows you to see better what's going on, ask more interesting questions, and update and improve your system.
