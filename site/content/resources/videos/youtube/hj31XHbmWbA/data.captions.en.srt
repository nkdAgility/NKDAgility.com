Steve Jobs said you can't connect the

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,279
dots looking forward you can only

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:10,000
connect them looking backwards and and

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
he's he's he's absolutely correct any

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,759
dots that you connect looking forward

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,520
into the future are are based on

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,359
assumptions are based on probabilities

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,680
maybe it will happen maybe it won't but

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,359
what we can do to help get a greater

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,119
inform of the future to help inform us

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
more about the future is to look at the

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,399
past look at the things that have

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,079
happened in the products that we have in

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,039
the teams that we've got and that will

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,079
help inform our choices moving forward

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:47,719
but we still need to validate and check

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,719
that they're not bad ideas
