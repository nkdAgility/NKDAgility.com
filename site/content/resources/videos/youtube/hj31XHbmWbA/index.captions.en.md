Steve Jobs said you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. And he's absolutely correct. Any dots that you connect looking forward into the future are based on assumptions, are based on probabilities. Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't. But what we can do to help get a greater inform of the future, to help inform us more about the future, is to look at the past. Look at the things that have happened in the products that we have, in the teams that we've got, and that will help inform our choices moving forward. But we still need to validate and check that they're not bad ideas.
