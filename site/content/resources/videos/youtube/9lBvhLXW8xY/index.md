Updating video content on a website can seem daunting, but I’m here to share my personal experience and guide you through the process step-by-step. Having navigated this terrain multiple times, I’ve honed a method that not only streamlines the workflow but also ensures that the content remains fresh and engaging. Let’s dive into how I update a video on GitHub, and I’ll share some tips along the way.

### Preparing the Issue

First things first, I always start by preparing an issue on GitHub. Here’s how I do it:

- **Create a New Issue**: Click on "New Issue" and fill in the title and description using markdown. You can easily paste content from Word, but remember to format it correctly in markdown.
- **Gather Necessary Information**: I make sure to have the video ID, the new title, the old link, and the current page ready. This helps in keeping everything organised.

### Setting Up the Workspace

Once the issue is prepared, I create a new branch for the update:

- **Create a New Branch**: I click on the "New Branch" button, give it a meaningful name, and open it in Codespace. This is essentially a virtual machine in the cloud that allows me to work on the code seamlessly.
- **Accessing the Code**: I navigate to the relevant folders in the repository. For video content, I typically go to `site/content/resources/video/YouTube`, where all the video files are stored.

### Editing the Content

Now comes the fun part—editing the content:

- **Locate the Video File**: I find the video file using the YouTube ID. For instance, if I’m looking for ID 1886, I scroll through the list until I find it.
- **Update the Title and Content**: I edit the file to replace the old content with the new markdown. This is where I ensure that the title reflects the latest changes and that the content is engaging and relevant.

### Important Changes to Make

While updating, there are a few critical changes I always remember to implement:

- **Update the Title**: I ensure the new title is reflected in the file.
- **Remove the Slug**: I delete the old slug to prevent any conflicts. The system will automatically generate a new URL based on the updated title.
- **Adjust the Priority**: I change the priority from four to six, signalling to search engines that this content has been updated.

### Committing and Pushing Changes

After making the necessary edits, it’s time to commit and push the changes:

- **Stage Changes**: I stage all my changes and commit them with a clear message about what was updated.
- **Push to Server**: I click on "Sync Changes" to push everything to the server. This is crucial for ensuring that the updates are reflected in the repository.

### Creating a Pull Request

With the changes pushed, I create a pull request:

- **Draft the Pull Request**: This allows me to review the changes before they go live. I can also invite others to review it, ensuring that everything looks good.
- **Preview Changes**: I take a moment to preview the changes to see how they will appear on the site. This step is vital for catching any last-minute issues.

### Final Steps

Once I’m satisfied with the preview, I proceed to merge the pull request:

- **Merge the Changes**: I confirm the merge, which integrates the updates into the main branch.
- **Check the Live Site**: Finally, I check the live site to ensure that everything is functioning as expected.

### Conclusion

Updating video content on GitHub doesn’t have to be a chore. By following these steps, I’ve found that I can efficiently manage updates while ensuring that the content remains relevant and engaging. Remember, the key is to stay organised and methodical in your approach. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the steps, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
