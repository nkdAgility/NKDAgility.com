1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,399
okay so we're going to update a

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,360
video um I have

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,639
pre-prepared um an issue on GitHub uh

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,160
what you do is you just click new issue

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,439
when you get here um put the title in

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,560
add the copy as markdown um you can just

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,160
paste from word and then you'll have to

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,720
to make it look like markdown uh here's

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,840
one I prepared earlier I've got

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,719
the video I D cuz that's where we're

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,760
going to find it I've got the new title

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,399
I've got the Old Link the current page I

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,480
just past pasted that in and then I

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,520
added the copy in here as uh

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,559
markdown so let me edit that there's the

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,000
copy you can add links and stuff in

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,079
there you can do all of those things and

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,879
they'll copy copy across um what's more

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,559
interesting if you're internal linking

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
to other posts that are the same um we

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,040
need to have conversation about that cuz

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,680
there's ways to do that to make it work

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:12,640
nicely uh but what I did what I didly

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:17,280
did was I created a

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,960
new um workspace I created a new Branch

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,079
so over here there was a button that

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,479
said New Branch I clicked it I just

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:30,200
created it locally um and it said do you

29
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:34,040
want to open in fact let's uh

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,040
let's delete that Branch just

31
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,360
now

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,000
delit it's gone

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,159
okay

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,200
so here's my content um I'm going to

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
create a new Branch it's going to create

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,479
a default name for that branch and I'm

37
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,399
going to say open in code space so I'm

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,240
going to create the branch

39
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,119
and I think I'll need to copy that

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,759
because I think it'll open in this

41
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,800
window and I still want a copy of this

42
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,840
so I can go back to

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000
it so now it's opening um a code space

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,160
what it's doing is basically it's a

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,040
virtual machine in the cloud it's

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,760
getting your code um the code for the

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,040
site getting it locally and building um

48
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,239
building that environment you just wait

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
for it to

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,720
open you can see on the bottom left it

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,560
says opening remote and there it is um

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,760
it's ready so it's built it's going to

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
do some Jiggy pokery behind the scenes

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,280
while we're while we're doing some other

55
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
things but it should be should be all

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,400
working so what I need to do is I need

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,720
to find um where this video is and if

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,280
you remember I used this code um for the

59
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,519
for the pages

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,440
so uh all of the code for the site is

61
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,799
under site

62
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,920
all of the content for the site is under

63
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:10,080
content so there's

64
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,360
capabilities company outcomes

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,879
resources okay so that's all the the

66
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,280
content for the site don't worry about

67
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,200
these ones these are for um yeah don't

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,319
worry about those ones uh so I'm going

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,959
to open up resources and then I'm going

70
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,920
to open up video and then we have a

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,519
folder called YouTube which is where

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,000
these are automatically added and you

73
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,280
can see it's got all the YouTube IDs so

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,040
I need to find one

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,000
1886 so if I just go down

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,120
1806 there it is and I can see it's got

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
the data file which is the stuff that

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,920
got exported out of YouTube and then

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,879
it's got the built uh content file okay

80
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,879
uh so this is it here what we're going

81
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,159
to do is we are going to uh do a couple

82
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,599
of things but let me walk you through

83
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,239
this file so this is the original title

84
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,760
and you'll notice uh you put a dot in

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,480
the title on YouTube so it pulled it in

86
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
here and it means that we've got this

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,920
extra little Dash on the end there to

88
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,519
represent that dot uh so that that

89
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,759
should all work um I've already added

90
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,440
this to the aliases in preparation for

91
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,120
us uh um setting this up so there's a

92
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,440
few changes we need to make here and we

93
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,320
need to update the copy so let's get the

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:32,479
copy first I'm going to edit this here

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:35,720
is our content going to copy that uh

96
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,560
markdown go over here um if you if

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,320
you've got markdown in

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,400
um chat GDP will output mark down and

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,039
you can just stick it in here or ask

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,080
whatever tool you're using to create it

101
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:50,160
as marked down so we're going to replace

102
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,160
uh this content here so I'm just going

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,360
to do that select it all boom there we

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,520
go I've

105
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,880
updated um the file with the new content

106
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,080
I keep this this is the video link

107
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,840
that's what renders the video at the top

108
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,280
uh you could put

109
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,880
it there that could look uh look good um

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,320
the default is the is at the top right

111
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,960
so I'm just going to leave it there and

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,520
then there's a couple of things we need

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,479
to do in this content if we leave it the

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,479
way it is um we've not updated the title

115
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:29,720
we've not updated the URL and this will

116
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:33,120
get overwritten um when we reprocess at

117
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,800
midnight okay so what you need to do in

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,919
order to prevent

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,160
that is we're going to take the

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,800
title and we're going to add it to the

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,639
title here okay so that will be the

122
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,639
new

123
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:57,080
title then we're going to remove the

124
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,520
slug so this manually set the

125
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,759
title The like the URL the bit at the

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,960
end end um to what this was if you

127
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,639
want you can make a new slug that's the

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,199
same as this and put it in here I think

129
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,720
it's unnecessary so I'm just going to

130
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,639
delete it and what it will do is it will

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,280
take this whatever's in here so if you

132
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,639
change it later um you need to remember

133
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,080
to do some stuff it will take whatever's

134
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,919
there and it will uh turn it into the

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,800
URL of the page so any special

136
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,199
characters anything like that will get

137
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,120
converted to dashes and it will do that

138
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:38,000
okay uh I already added this which is

139
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,639
the old URL so the redirect is already

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
there um so you don't need to worry

141
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:45,800
about that but we do need to remove the

142
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,440
canonical URL that's what I search for

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,960
when we're updating the content if

144
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,080
there's no canonical URL it's not going

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,680
to try and update this file and the last

146
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,879
thing we need to do is change the

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,919
priority from four one below half to six

148
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,599
one above half um so that Google and

149
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,120
everything knows that we have uh updated

150
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,280
this content so there's a do not don't

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,879
change the date um there's a hidden

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,800
value which is when we save this it will

153
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,840
automatically take that the last uh uh

154
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:25,160
time we edited it as the um the date in

155
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,080
there so that's fine and that's us if I

156
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,240
save that file and close it we've now

157
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,960
changed the file but we need to publish

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,960
it so I need to go over here you'll see

159
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,720
see it says one file pending changes

160
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,560
this is our source control so if we go

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,240
into Source control um we've got our our

162
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,319
index um and I'm just going to

163
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,479
grab this

164
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,440
title in fact including the little hashy

165
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,159
bit the whole

166
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:02,159
thing and I'm going to say uh updated

167
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,199
new new copy

168
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:09,360
for

169
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,840

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,560
everything up and make sure it's all

171
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,080
connected properly you don't have to put

172
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,199
it uh but you have to put some text in

173
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,599
here and then I'm going to commit

174
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,199

commit like you could make packages if

181
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,880
you're doing lots of changes but don't

182
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,360
worry about it now we've saved it

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,560
locally we've published it locally but

184
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,360
we need to push it to the server so I

185
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,360
click this sync

186
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:58,040
changes

187
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:02,680
okay so now it's pushed that um to the

188
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,680
server so if we we go over

189
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,959
here go to pull requests you'll see

190
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,720
here's

191
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,800
our copy we've it's now published into

192
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,000
Source control in a branch we need to

193
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,120
get it onto we need to start the process

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,560
to get it published for reals so we

195
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,519
create a pool request and it will

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,240
basically take exactly I'm actually just

197
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,079
GNA fix that there it always does that

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,079
because it's just long

199
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:40,399
um going to do that draft

200
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:46,519
it there we go so now that's going to

201
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:50,800
publish a canary version of our of our

202
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,079
product okay um so this is where we can

203
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,600
see like what are the changes that we've

204
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,920
done what do they look like how are they

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,600
how are they how are they used so if I

206
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
go along here you can see it's got the

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,760
ation so if we have to have a chat about

208
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,200
it we can do that in here um we've got

209
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,040
the commits so what are the the the

210
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,600
number of changes we've made only made

211
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,480
one and we got the files that we've

212
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,680
changed which is only one so if I click

213
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,920
on preview

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,560
changes it will actually show it's kind

215
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,399
of a weird view cuz it's in line it will

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,399
show all the changes that we've made so

217
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,480
minuses are rows that are deleted plus

218
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,279
these are rows that are added so we kind

219
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,120
of deleted the title and added a new

220
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,600
title um we deleted the four and added

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,160
the six and then you'll see it's kind of

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,399
doing it line by line um but we replaced

223
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:44,519
with the new copy that's much

224
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:47,800
longer okay so that's all looks pretty

225
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,440
good um what you would do I and we can

226
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,680
probably set it up as a as an automatic

227
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,040
um but you can

228
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,880
ask I can't ask myself for a review but

229
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,000
you'll have me in there so you'll be

230
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,279
able to just click on me uh and ask it

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,240
for ask me for a review um what we're

232
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,320
waiting for is for it to all

233
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,480
publish right so you can see there that

234
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:18,560
it's done some stages already it's uh

235
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,120
done run data yeah it's building the

236
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,279
site right now and building the apis and

237
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,279
then it will publish the site once it's

238
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,279
finished publishing the site we'll get a

239
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,279
little um

240
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,480
message in here to tell us it's been

241
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,800
published

242
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,320
okay so this it's finished publishing

243
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,079
the site you can see all the checks have

244
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,279
passed so everything looks good now we

245
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:55,279
can go check out the new page so I'm

246
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,800
using control again to open this and

247
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,880
this is a special copy of the whole site

248
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,560
46

249
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,320
146 just for

250
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,440
you so we're going to go in here you can

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,079
see it will say Canary at the top and

252
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,240
there's our pool request number and

253
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,240
we're going to go

254
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,240
into

255
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,040
videos and then uh we could

256
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,800
probably we could probably just find it

257
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:32,160
but what I'm going to

258
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,920
do is I'm going to Nick the URL we're in

259
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,920
videos I'm going to put that on the end

260
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,199
there we go so now this page is the

261
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,120
hidden cost of pro quality code and how

262
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:46,480
to turn it into a super power is the new

263
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,560
title

264
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,440
um so there you go there's the new site

265
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,760
published so we can come back here um

266
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,839
somebody will approve it and then we

267
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,639
need to it's ready for review and then

268
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,639
you submit for review

269
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:06,959
it's all good we've checked it like you

270
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:10,199
can check this and then make a change

271
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,839
okay um so let's say we weren't happy

272
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,160
with what it looked like and we wanted

273
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:20,000
to make a change I would go back to my

274
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:24,839
code space over here and I would go

275
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,560
edit this uh this file again so let's

276
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,760
say um I don't know let's say I did want

277
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,160
this to be

278
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,240
here so I would make that

279
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:42,160
change I would go over here put a cop it

280
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:47,240
commit it locally push it to the server

281
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,120
this would start again a new post will

282
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,639
get made because this will be refreshed

283
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,839
with the new version and everything will

284
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,000
be good but we're not going to do that

285
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,639
I'm going to merge that pull request cuz

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,759
we are in fact happy with it so I'm

287
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,320
going to merge it it'll ask me how do

288
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,959
you want to merge it I just want to do

289
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,959
this

290
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:15,959
confirm there we go so that is

291
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,560
all merged in that branch that we were

292
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,600
working on has been deleted therefore

293
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,399
the code

294
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,560
space uh it's still there but I'm pretty

295
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,720
sure that will vaporize in a little

296
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,160
bit um and we go back

297
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:37,199
here and we're done that is heading to

298
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,320
preview site so if you want to know when

299
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,920
it is done you'll see this one here on

300
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,079
Main is uh heading there and doing all

301
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,279
the stuff so this will publish it to

302
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,040
preview and then we need

303
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,240
to manually publish it to live um but

304
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,959
this is a good way to see that so

305
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
that'll end up on preview there you go
