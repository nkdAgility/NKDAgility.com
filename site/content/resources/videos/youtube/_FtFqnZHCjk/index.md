This insightful video explores how the core tools and techniques remain the same, but the approach and context shift significantly in the Agile world. Discover how faster release cycles, feedback loops, and a focus on continuous delivery impact the way product managers operate.

Time-Stamped Summary:

(00:00:00 - 00:01:55): The fundamental goal of product management remains the same: maximizing business value. However, Agile introduces a shift in how this is achieved.

(00:07:44 - 00:09:32): The impact of Agile on traditional practices:
Change requests become less relevant due to the ability to adapt quickly.
User acceptance testing (UAT) shifts towards ensuring high-quality engineering practices.
(09:32 - 10:55): The importance of building quality into the product from the start and the role of a clear "definition of done" in Agile.
