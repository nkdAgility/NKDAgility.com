Discussions on feedback loops, incorporating customer input into planning, and the shift towards measuring value via responsiveness and satisfaction suggest strong alignment. However, the depth is moderate: while customer focus underpins many examples and takeaways, the article frequently pivots toward broader Agile/product management benefits (e.g., ROI, team responsiveness) rather than sustained, deep dives into how customer metrics drive day-to-day decisions. The intent is highly relevantâ€”educating Agile practitioners about how modern product management has evolved to be more customer-centric. The audience is product and delivery professionals, consistent with the category. The discussion is focused, with minimal tangents, and virtually all sections tie back to value delivery and responsiveness. No content is outdated or contradicts the theme, so no penalties apply.",
