1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,480
definition of dun in scrum is one of the

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:13,440
most important pieces of the puzzle uh

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,920
definition of done uh really represents

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,920
the level of quality um that your

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,480
product

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,800
has but

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,439
it's that it's almost that line you have

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,160
to cross if if you look at the the the

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,920
US Department of Defense uh guide

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,760
detecting adile [Â __Â ] one of my

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,559
favorite articles uh you'll see it talks

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,079
about um working product in front of

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,120
real users every iteration including the

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,120
first the agile

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:53,399
Manifesto talks about um working usable

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:58,079
product um at least every few weeks at

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,920
least every few months right and scrum

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,760
is

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,920
probably

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,439
the strictest of them that says you need

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,240
to have usable working product at the

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,159
end of every Sprint every Sprint you

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,479
must have usable working product that

24
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,560
doesn't mean you're going to ship it

25
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,720
although why would you build a bunch of

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,040
value and then not advertise it right is

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,320
that right but the minimum for

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
scrum the minimum to be doing scrum is

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,479
that you need a usable working product

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,439
at end of the Sprint that usable working

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,439
product is the

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,200
foundation of risk mitigation in scrum

33
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,119
It ultimately usable working product is

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,079
the foundation of risk mitigation in all

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,600
of agile practices right um but it's

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,159
also that that moment of

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,799
transparency right if you think about

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,640
the other transparencies in scrum you've

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,520
got transparency of the future with the

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,960
the the product backlog you've got

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,000
transparency of the present with the

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,079
Sprint backlog and then transparency of

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,079
the past is the increment right and the

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,479
way we enable transparency of the past

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,200
is through committing to the definition

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,000
of done without that commitment to the

47
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,120
definition of done having a definition

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
of done that represents usable working

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,400
product and meeting it at the end of

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,080
every Sprint then the other two

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,760
transparencies are

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,560
irrelevant right unless we can see what

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
we've done how can we know where we're

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,680
going if you don't know where you are

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,959
and where you've

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,840
been how do you know how to get to where

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
you want to be you you have to

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,440
understand what's in your product

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,239
currently whether it works or it doesn't

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,879
I is it finished or is there more work

61
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,840
to do to make it get to that

62
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,720
point before you can figure out how do

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,599
we if this is the future State and this

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,640
is the current state and our backlog

65
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:55,000
represents a diff between those two

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,920
states if this is a false State i. it's

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,879
not transparent where we currently are

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,360
maybe we're here maybe we're there maybe

69
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,840
we're over here if we don't know then we

70
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,080
don't know the journey we have to take

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,560
between those two points right so

72
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:15,000
definition of done is the commitment to

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:18,319
Quality that enables us to have that

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,519
point and then the next little

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,080
journey is your your Sprint back clog

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,239
but we still have to know where we are

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,120
to know where at the end of the Sprint

78
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,319
we need to

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,640
be right so that's that critical

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,879
importance and we we use that as our

81
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,200
risk M risk mitigation in scrum in

82
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,200
traditional models you're going to look

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,239
at across the entire life of the product

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,159
the project right you're going to look

85
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,400
at all of the risks that might possibly

86
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,680
happen and then you're going to create a

87
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,120
bunch of mitigating actions should those

88
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,200
risks arise and that's part of your your

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,439
plan for for the whole thing but in

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,720
agile we're we're not planning that far

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,599
ahead head we're planning more often but

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,680
in smaller chunks to see if we get there

93
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,040
so the way that we mitigate risk in that

94
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,120
story and we don't go off in the wrong

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,079
direction we don't build a bunch of

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,919
stuff that doesn't actually work and

97
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,919
then we find out later right that's

98
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,919
adding risk we need that working usable

99
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:28,240
product so the definition of done is the

100
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,680
most important and foundational Concept

101
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,400
in scrum and I would suggest all of

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,960
agile knowing what it means to be done

103
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,479
is that important yeah so that

104
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,280
definition of done being so important is

105
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,759
absolutely critical to the success of

106
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,680
any product and here's a good test that

107
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,199
you can use with your team um if you

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,000
have a team if you work with a team if

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,160
you're a leader and there are teams

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,240
right go ask somebody on the team

111
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
perhaps bring it up at the review right

112
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,840
ask ask what the definition of d is if

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,280
they haven't articulated it to you and

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,560
if the answer is anything other than our

115
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,280
definition of done is this if it's

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,039
anything other than that they don't have

117
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,240
one if the answer is it's on the wiki

118
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,800
it's on the wiki right they don't have

119
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,800
one because if it's on the wiki and each

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,520
individual member of the team can't

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,240
articulate it what are the chances that

122
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,440
they're meeting it therefore it does not

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,199
exist

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,720
so have a definition of done get one if

125
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,120
you don't have

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,319
one definition of done the most

127
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,039
important thing in agile and scrum
