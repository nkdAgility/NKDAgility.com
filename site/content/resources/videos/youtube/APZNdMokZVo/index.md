short_title: Definition of Done in Agile for Quality Delivery
description: Explains why a clear Definition of Done is vital in Agile and Scrum for quality delivery, transparency, and risk mitigation, with tips for team alignment and improvement.
tldr: A clear and shared Definition of Done is essential for delivering quality products in Agile and Scrum, as it sets the standard for what is considered complete and ensures transparency across the team. Without it, teams risk miscommunication, unfinished work, and features that do not meet user needs. Development managers should regularly review and reinforce the Definition of Done with their teams to improve quality and reduce risk.

In my journey through the world of Agile and [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}), one concept has consistently stood out as a cornerstone of success: the [Definition of Done]({{< ref "/tags/definition-of-done" >}}) (DoD). It’s not just a checklist; it’s a commitment to quality that shapes the very essence of our work. Today, I want to share my insights on why the Definition of Done is crucial and how it can transform your team's approach to delivering value.

### What is the Definition of Done?

The Definition of Done represents the level of quality that your product must achieve before it can be considered complete. It’s that critical line we must cross to ensure we’re delivering a usable product at the end of every Sprint. According to the Agile Manifesto, we should aim for a working, usable product at least every few weeks. Scrum takes this a step further, insisting that we must have a usable working product at the end of every Sprint. 

- **Key Takeaway**: The DoD is not merely a formality; it’s the foundation of risk mitigation in Scrum and all Agile practices. Without it, we risk building features that may not work or meet user needs.

### The Importance of [Transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}})

Transparency is a fundamental principle in Scrum, and the Definition of Done plays a pivotal role in this. We have three types of transparency in Scrum:

1. **Transparency of the Future**: This is represented by the [product backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}), where we outline what we aim to achieve.
2. **Transparency of the Present**: The Sprint backlog shows us what we are currently working on.
3. **Transparency of the Past**: The [increment]({{< ref "/tags/increment" >}}), enabled by our commitment to the Definition of Done, allows us to reflect on what we’ve accomplished.

Without a clear DoD, the other two transparencies become irrelevant. If we cannot see what we’ve done, how can we understand where we are going? It’s essential to know the current state of our product—whether it’s finished or if more work is needed—before we can plan our next steps.

### Risk Mitigation in Agile

In traditional [project management]({{< ref "/tags/project-management" >}}), risk is often assessed across the entire lifecycle of a project, with extensive plans created to mitigate potential issues. However, Agile encourages us to plan more frequently and in smaller increments. This approach allows us to adapt quickly and avoid building features that don’t meet user needs.

- **How to Mitigate Risk**:
  - Ensure you have a clear Definition of Done.
  - Regularly review and adapt your DoD with your team.
  - Foster open communication about what it means to be "done."

### A Test for Your Team

Here’s a practical exercise you can do with your team to assess your Definition of Done. During your next review, ask team members to articulate what the DoD is. If the response is vague or if someone says, “It’s on the wiki,” then it’s clear that your team lacks a solid understanding of it. A well-defined DoD should be something every team member can confidently explain.

### Conclusion

The Definition of Done is not just a box to tick; it’s a vital component of Agile and Scrum that ensures we deliver quality products. If you don’t have a DoD, I urge you to create one. It’s the most important thing you can do to enhance your team’s effectiveness and the quality of your product.

If you found this discussion valuable, I encourage you to engage with me. I always welcome comments and questions, and if you’d like to chat further about Agile, Scrum, or [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), feel free to book a coffee with me through Naked Agility. Let’s continue the conversation and elevate our understanding of what it means to be truly “done.”
