There are zero direct mentions of Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, or applications. The themes, examples, and structure relate only to DoD; SLE is not even indirectly referenced. Thus, the Direct Mentions score is near zero. Alignment and Depth are both very low, scoring only for the faint conceptual overlap with predictability/transparency principles—general Agile values that are not exclusive to SLE. The Intent/Purpose Fit is low because the main goal is to teach and advocate for strong DoDs, not SLEs. Audience Alignment and Signal-to-Noise are scored moderately since the audience could overlap (Agile practitioners), but the content does not diverge into off-topic tangents. No penalties are applied since the content is neither obsolete nor critical of SLE—it is simply off-topic. The extremely low overall confidence reflects the lack of any substantive or even passing reference to SLE, in complete accordance with the strict definition and exclusions for this category.",
