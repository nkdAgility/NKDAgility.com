1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,480
having scrum

2
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:09,679
Masters that have a a a a lack of

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,200
competence within the context of the

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,359
team's work the product owners work and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,960
the organizational

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,119
structure means that you're going you're

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,720
going to

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,880
be getting less return on your

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,840
investment I mean that's fundamentally

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,640
what it is uh the team is probably going

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,719
to be delivering less stuff it's

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,800
probably going to be making fewer bets

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,280
on new stuff so you're probably going to

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:47,520
spend less time on that new stuff and

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,160
they're probably going to have higher um

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,440
higher defect rates right because they

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,160
don't have the modern engineering

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,039
excellence and devops practices that are

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,000
needed to build awesome products in

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
today's world there absolutely teams out

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,199
there that are doing this without scrum

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,880
Masters right I I I I'm not disagreeing

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,479
with that um I'm saying that if you have

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,479
a scrum Master with the capability to

25
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,280
help a team maximize those

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,920
capabilities

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,759
then you're going to be able to to

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,600
vastly increase your Roi for your team

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,439
but you need scrum masters with those

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,960
competencies otherwise all you're going

31
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,439
to get is teams that are happier with

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,640
each other not teams that are able to

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,000
actually deliver more stuff both of

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,720
those things are important but

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,880
delivering more stuff is where your Roi

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,600
comes in um so we

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,680
you what I would want you to do is I

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,640
would want you to collect some metrics

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,680
and you use those metrics to measure the

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,920
fundamental benefit that the scrum

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,719
Masters are bringing you okay bang for

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,360
their Buck Right and so here's some

43
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,479
examples I'm going to use an example

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
over here because I have some data

45
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,319
around it um I would want to measure

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,400
Innovation rate which is the percentage

47
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,959
of time that your team spends working on

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,840
net new

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,480
functionality versus maintenance and

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,879
support and augmenting existing

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,840
functionality right so if you're Netflix

52
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,560
that's a new series versus a second

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,440
season of his existing series right or

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
remastering some older Series right so

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,560
that's this

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,480
measure um I want to measure my on

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,480
product index I want to be measuring the

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,159
percentage of time that my team members

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,640
have to work on my product versus having

60
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,760
to work on other things right so what

61
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,879
percentage of time are they actually

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,599
working on my on my

63
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,920
product I want to be monitoring my usage

64
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:06,400
index for my product so I'm looking at

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,959
at uh um the percent like uh data around

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,159
Um how my users interact with my product

67
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,840
right that's a great metric and then

68
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,519
perhaps uh if you have a let's say you

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,920
have a a an app that is installed I

70
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,640
maintain and support one um you have the

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,239
installed version index what percentage

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,200
of people running your tool are on the

73
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,920
latest version of the tool and what

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,920
percentage are on older versions of the

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,280
tool because that goes to to engineering

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,840
excellence and various things let's say

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,439
you had those

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,000
metrics I'm going to tell you the

79
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,200
industry standard for each of those

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,879
metrics um and we're going to base it on

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,959
a on a for every dollar and yeah I'm

82
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,319
using US dollar pound Euro whatever you

83
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,760
want um for each dollar you spend on

84
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,959
your product um what you

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,519
lose by by each of these metrics so The

86
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,920
Innovation rate is about

87
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,840
29% that's the average Innovation rate

88
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,000
that's from the Dora metrics so for

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
every

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
dollar that you spend on your product

91
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,560
you're getting about 29 cents of net new

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,400
value right for opening up new markets

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,400
for adding new capabilities to your

94
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,880
products 29 cents so you're 29 cents in

95
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,360
the dollar right um right off the

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,080
bat most teams spend about 80% of their

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,360
time working on the product and 20% of

98
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,639
their time doing other stuff for the

99
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,400
organization so that could be meetings

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,639
all hands

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,160
training stuff right it's about I think

102
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,120
that's about a day a week isn't it

103
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,400
something like that anyway um so now

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,360
you're down to 23 cents in the dollar

105
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,560
because you've lost 20%

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:02,039
right what about usage index what do you

107
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:06,360
think uh uh uh uh the the the metric

108
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,919
show the data that I've seen um some of

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,840
it's from real

110
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,199
customers um The Happy metrics are from

111
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,000
uh uh the chaos report uh from the

112
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,919
Standish group in Boston um and they

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,680
found that only about 35% of the

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,000
features that are built are actually

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,759
used by your customers only about

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,280
35% right that's because we're not

117
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,600
changing fast enough we're not adapting

118
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,600
fast enough 35% so now we're down to8

119
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,120
cents on the

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,240
dollar 8 cents on the dollar eight out

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,759
of 100

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,400
right 8 cents return on investment for a

123
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,639
$1

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,080
input what the

125
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,520
heck that is

126
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,400
terrible 8 cents on the

127
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,240
dollar and that metric is really

128
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,080
optimistic I did some work with a bank

129
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,240
in the US who said that uh 35% usage

130
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,440
index that's that's crap we know our

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
customers way better than that we

132
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,440
understand uh uh they're using all of

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
our our features or as much as you know

134
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,960
they're oh we're 80% right so we said

135
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,160
why why don't we add some Telemetry onto

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,319
your product and let's see they are

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,639
cloud-based products it was easy is so

138
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,520
we added Telemetry to the product we

139
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,280
gave it 3 months and we looked at the

140
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,400
data and it was about

141
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,199
8% of of the features in the product

142
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,720
were actually used by their customers

143
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,919
and that was over a year end luckily we

144
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,000
were just in the right time for that so

145
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,560
it was over a year end so that was a

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,360
really good picture 8% not 35% 8% of the

147
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,680
features so that wouldn't be8 cents in

148
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,160
the dollar that would be a lot less um

149
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,280
and then let's say installed version

150
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,280
index let's say it's 70% 70% of your

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,120
users are on the latest version of your

152
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,919
product now we're down to 6 cents on the

153
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,599
dollar do you you know do you even know

154
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,240
what your numbers look like just those

155
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:10,160
metrics Innovation rate on product index

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,879
usage index and still version

157
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,360
index it's only four

158
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,120
metrics go collect

159
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,479
them and then

160
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,080
measure your progress over time and if

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,599
you hire scrum Masters they should be

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
able to change those

163
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
numbers your scrum

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,560
Masters should be

165
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,240
accountable for the effectiveness of the

166
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,720
team and you can measure the

167
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
effectiveness of the team within the

168
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,599
context of a

169
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,120
product by some of these metrics these

170
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,159
are not the only metrics I just picked

171
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
four right because I have some data

172
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:50,039
around

173
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,039
them pick some metrics that are product

174
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,080
based metrics value based metrics for

175
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,159
you as a

176
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,720
business and expect those numbers to

177
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,960
improve

178
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,080
when you hire scrum Masters if they

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,080
don't you've got the wrong scrum Masters
