When organizations invest in Scrum Masters, they expect results. Yet, too often, they find that the promised returns aren't realized. Why is that? It boils down to a lack of competence within the Scrum Master's role‚Äîparticularly in understanding the context of the team, the product owner, and the organizational structure. Without this, the return on investment (ROI) diminishes. Let's dive into why having a skilled Scrum Master is crucial and how to measure their impact effectively.

## **Why Competent Scrum Masters Matter**

A competent Scrum Master can significantly impact a team's success. Here's how:

- **Increased Team Delivery**: With a skilled Scrum Master, teams deliver more value. They are better equipped to take calculated risks, leading to more innovation and new opportunities.

- **Enhanced Focus on New Work**: Without competent leadership, teams often spend excessive time on maintenance rather than focusing on new developments. A good Scrum Master helps balance this focus.

- **Lower Defect Rates**: Competence in modern engineering practices and DevOps means fewer bugs and higher-quality products, which is essential in today's fast-paced tech landscape.

### **What Happens Without a Competent Scrum Master?**

When a Scrum Master lacks the necessary skills, here's what you can expect:

- **Less Delivery**: Teams may struggle to push out new features or improvements, directly impacting ROI.

- **Higher Defect Rates**: Without strong practices, teams may experience increased defects, leading to more time spent on bug fixes rather than innovation.

- **Limited Team Growth**: Teams might become comfortable with their pace, leading to stagnation rather than growth.

üëâ _Remember: Happy teams are essential, but the true ROI comes from delivering valuable products to your customers._

## **Measuring the Value of a Scrum Master**

To truly assess the impact of a Scrum Master, you need to gather data. Below are some key metrics that can help you determine their effectiveness.

### **1\. Innovation Rate: Is Your Team Innovating Enough?**

- **Definition**: The innovation rate measures the percentage of time your team spends on new functionality versus maintaining or improving existing features.

- **Why It Matters**: Higher innovation rates mean your team is adding more value to your product, attracting new customers, and opening new markets.

- **Industry Standard**: According to DORA metrics, the average innovation rate is around 29%. This means for every dollar spent, only 29 cents go toward creating new value.

üîç _Example_: A major streaming platform like Netflix might compare the development of a new series (innovation) against remastering an existing one (maintenance).

### **2\. On-Product Index: Where Is Your Team's Time Going?**

- **Definition**: This measures the percentage of time team members dedicate to your product versus other tasks, such as meetings or organizational activities.

- **Why It Matters**: If your team spends too much time outside of product development, you're not getting the most out of your investment.

- **Industry Insight**: Most teams allocate 80% of their time to the product and 20% to other activities, roughly equivalent to one day a week lost to non-productive tasks.

üìÖ _Recommendation_: Track this to ensure your team remains focused on value-adding activities.

### **3\. Usage Index: Are Your Customers Using What You Build?**

- **Definition**: This measures the percentage of product features actively used by your customers.

- **Why It Matters**: A low usage index indicates that your team is building features that customers don't find valuable.

- **Reality Check**: According to the Standish Group's CHAOS report, only about 35% of features are actually used. However, real-world data can often be much lower.

üí° _Example_: A bank I worked with believed they had an 80% usage rate for their features. But after adding telemetry to track actual usage, it turned out only 8% of features were used.

### **4\. Installed Version Index: Are Your Users Up-to-Date?**

- **Definition**: This tracks the percentage of your user base using the latest version of your product.

- **Why It Matters**: A higher percentage means better adoption of new features and less time spent supporting outdated versions.

- **Industry Insight**: A 70% installed version index is common, but it means that 30% of users may not be benefiting from your latest improvements.

üì≤ _Tip_: Aim for a higher installed version index to reduce support time and costs.

## **Calculating the Real ROI: The Harsh Truth**

Let‚Äôs look at the combined impact of these metrics on your ROI. For every dollar you spend on product development:

- **Innovation Rate**: 29 cents of net new value.

- **On-Product Index**: Lose 20%, bringing it down to 23 cents.

- **Usage Index**: Drops it further, as only 35% of features are used, reducing it to around 8 cents.

- **Installed Version Index**: Lowers this to around 6 cents.

üö® _Warning_: That‚Äôs 6 cents of return for every dollar invested! And this is with optimistic numbers.

### **Real-World Data: The Importance of Measuring Success**

A bank I consulted with discovered the gap between perception and reality when they thought their feature usage was at 80%, but actual data showed just 8%. This was a wake-up call and led to changes in their product strategy.

üìà _Lesson_: Don‚Äôt rely on assumptions‚Äîuse real data to drive your decisions.

## **How a Competent Scrum Master Can Change the Game**

A skilled Scrum Master can directly influence these metrics by:

- **Boosting Innovation Rates**: By facilitating better team collaboration, encouraging experimentation, and focusing on value.

- **Increasing the On-Product Index**: Reducing distractions and helping the team maintain focus on delivering value.

- **Improving the Usage Index**: Guiding product owners to focus on features that matter most to users.

- **Elevating the Installed Version Index**: Encouraging best practices in release management and user adoption.

* * *

## **Measuring Scrum Master Impact: Hold Them Accountable**

Your Scrum Masters should be able to demonstrate their impact through improved metrics. If you don‚Äôt see improvements over time, it might be time to reconsider your investment.

**Key Takeaways: How to Measure and Improve ROI**

- **Choose the Right Metrics**: Focus on innovation rate, on-product index, usage index, and installed version index.

- **Track Progress**: Measure these regularly and adjust your strategy as needed.

- **Hold Scrum Masters Accountable**: Expect tangible improvements in these metrics when you hire skilled Scrum Masters.

üöÄ _Pro Tip_: If your metrics aren‚Äôt improving, you‚Äôve likely got the wrong Scrum Master for the job.

## **Conclusion: Competence Is Key to Unlocking ROI**

In today‚Äôs competitive landscape, a competent Scrum Master can be the difference between a team that merely gets by and one that thrives. It‚Äôs not just about having happier teams; it's about delivering more value to your customers. Measure, adjust, and ensure your investment in Scrum Masters pays off. üëâ **Final Thought**: Don't settle for mediocrity. Invest in Scrum Masters who can drive real change and watch your ROI soar.
