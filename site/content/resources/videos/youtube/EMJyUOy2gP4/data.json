    "description": "The True ROI of Hiring Competent Scrum Masters\n\nIn this video, we’re discussing the *return on investment (ROI)* you should expect from hiring competent Scrum Masters. A Scrum Master who lacks competence in the context of the team’s work, product ownership, and organizational structure results in teams that deliver less value, produce more defects, and struggle to innovate. You’re simply not going to see the ROI you expect without the right skill set in place.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn from Watching This Video\n  \nIn this video, I explain why hiring skilled Scrum Masters is essential for maximizing your team’s performance and delivering meaningful product outcomes. You’ll learn:  \n\n- How competent Scrum Masters directly impact a team’s ability to deliver value, innovate, and maintain engineering excellence.  \n- Why you need to measure **product-based metrics** to track the real impact Scrum Masters have on your team’s effectiveness and ROI.  \n- Specific metrics such as **innovation rate**, **usage index**, and **installed version index**, which help quantify how well your team is performing and delivering value to customers.  \n- How to calculate your **return on the dollar** for every investment in product development, and how these metrics reveal where your Scrum Master’s influence should show improvement.  \n\nKey Chapters \n- [00:00:00] – The Problem with Incompetent Scrum Masters: Why lacking skills in team context results in poor ROI.  \n- [00:01:37] – Delivering More Stuff: Why ROI is about delivering value and not just improving team happiness.  \n- [00:02:02] – Key Metrics to Measure: Innovation rate, usage index, and other product-based metrics to track Scrum Master effectiveness.  \n- [00:06:44] – Real-World Data: How companies can misjudge their effectiveness and the importance of actual data in assessing product success.  \n- **[00:07:44]** – Measuring Scrum Master Impact: Expect real change in your metrics when you hire competent Scrum Masters, or you’ve hired the wrong ones.\n\nIf you’re ready to measure the real impact of your Scrum Masters and improve your team’s ability to deliver valuable outcomes, visit https://www.nkdagility.com.
