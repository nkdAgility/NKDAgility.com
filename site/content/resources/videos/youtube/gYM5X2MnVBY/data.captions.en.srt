1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,160
agile is hard and it's designed for

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,400
complex environments so as you would

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,320
expect there are many behaviors that

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,559
I've found in organizations that are

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,000
suboptimal to say the least here are my

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
seven deadly sins of

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,599
agile hi I'm Martin hinwood owner and

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,240
principal consultant at naked agility

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,079
scrum.org a professional cand trainer

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,120
with Pro caman and I've been a Microsoft

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
MVP in GitHub and Azure devops for 15

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:53,079
years one of the seven deadly sins of

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:57,320
agile is lust is is loads of

15
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,480
organizations are um talking

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,840
about agile transformation

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,040
digital

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,280
transformation whatever

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,720
transformation they they want something

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,799
different because they've

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,360
realized that the markets have changed

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,799
right it's taken them a long time to

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
realize the markets have changed they

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,320
changed years ago right in fact 1930s

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,680
was when the market started to change

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,600
1970s they were totally changed and it's

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
taken until now for a lot of companies

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,159
to actually realize oh [Â __Â ] stuff's

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
changed what's going on right why why

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,280
isn't our old processes and systems uh

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,840
uh working so now they're looking around

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,600
for something new they've got that I was

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,159
going to say seveny year itch right but

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,360
it's the 70-year itch um and they're

35
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,680
looking around for new processes and

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,439
practices that they can use and they see

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,640
this agile thing doing really well and

38
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,880
they want it right they want they want

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,799
it desperately and they don't really

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,640
want to do the work for

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,320
it they just W to buy it I think there

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,759
must be a usism for that but I think

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,200
I'll stay away from it um they just want

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080
to they just want to buy this thing they

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,520
don't want to actually spend the effort

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,040
and the time and the energy to figure

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,200
out what it means for them and their

48
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,080
business they just want somebody else to

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,040
come in and install it they just want to

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,959
pay somebody to come in and do it for

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,720
them right that's what they want to do

52
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,239
and that's why you see a lot of

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,879
organizations bringing in and you know

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,560
the big four Consulting companies you

55
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,160
see McKenzie and Accenture and Boston

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,239
Consulting Group coming in um giving

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,640
giving giving advice but the problem is

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,360
they're giving advice based on all of

59
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,760
these other big organizational

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,959
Transformations there is no precedent

61
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,319
within your organization for agile you

62
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,120
can't just look at what somebody else is

63
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,920
doing and lust after it and bring it

64
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,440
into your organization you need to build

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:09,040
your own unique way of doing things over

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,200
time and actually do the work to get

67
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,959
there and that's uh why you can't just

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,360
lust after this agile thing you need to

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,360
do the work to bring it into your

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,959
organization one of the seven uh deadly

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,360
sins of agile is gluttony and I see this

72
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,360
a lot um in teams where

73
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,120
their their their backlogs and their

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,959
products become

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:43,159
bloed um bloed and full of basically

76
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,879
just full of crap that needs to go right

77
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,400
so one one uh common um entry is is is

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,360
the product backlog if you if you go

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
into a a team you're working with a team

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
and you go to look at their product

81
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,760
backlog and there's let's say there's

82
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,319
six or seven people working on this team

83
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,159
and they have 5,000 things in their

84
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,640
product backlog they're doing it wrong

85
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,000
right there that's that's greedy they'

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,200
they've eaten all those backlog items

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,079
they're sitting in their belly and they

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,360
can't walk around they can't move

89
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,840
they're not going to be nimble right

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
they're not going to be agile because

91
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,799
it's it's almost impossible to

92
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,240
understand like what is our value what

93
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,000
value is in our product backlog diving

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,240
into that thing is just just not a good

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
idea right you you've get too much stuff

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,600
in your product backlog

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,759
another another way gluttony manifests

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,080
is during Sprint planning right shoving

99
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,360
more stuff into the Sprint backlog uh

100
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,320
than the team can possibly deliver in a

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,000
single Sprint and that continually

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,919
results in the team having to vomit uh

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,800
uh backlog items into the next Sprint

104
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,720
right if you think of it that way

105
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,919
perhaps teams will stop doing it um

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,240
taking on too much and then it spews

107
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,240
into the next Sprint and if it's if it's

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,639
one or two things that move into the

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,600
next Sprint and maybe not every Sprint

110
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,000
is probably okay right you're not going

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,600
to be successful in everything you do

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,960
but if you're constantly

113
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,560
got tons of things from a Sprint flowing

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,080
into the next Sprint flowing into the

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,479
next Sprint perhaps there's need to

116
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,800
consider um are we taking on too much

117
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
work um are we doing too much are we

118
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,240
taking on too much work work um so

119
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,639
that's that's the second second form of

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,960
of gney uh that I see in teams and the

121
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,880
third form is uh leaving stuff that

122
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,039
nobody uses in your

123
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,960
product right uh the Standish group uh

124
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
in Boston used to create the chaos

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,680
report every year and they analyzed

126
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,319
about 70,000 projects worldwide and they

127
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,000
found that only only 35% of the features

128
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,240
uh that we build are used by our

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,039
customers 65% I think the phrase was Ed

130
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:11,919
little if ever 65% use little if ever so

131
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,680
so hopefully we can stop building them

132
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,039
in the first place right that would be

133
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,639
great let's stop building them in the

134
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,960
first place but if we have built

135
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:23,759
them why are you keeping them in your

136
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,680
product why are you continuing to spend

137
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,800
maintenance hours support right how long

138
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,919
does your build take um how long your

139
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,080
build take if you remov 65% of the code

140
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,840
that's in your product right because

141
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,599
you've got rid of those features your

142
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,440
build would be faster your teams will be

143
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,800
able to work faster there's a less

144
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,919
complicated uh body of content you'll

145
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,759
just get better and faster at doing

146
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:52,280
doing doing things so the way to to to

147
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,720
ah man loads of teams just need a

148
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,039
gastric bypass for that right um how how

149
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,000
do you how do you restrict the the the

150
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,759
amount of um stuff that's in a in a

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,720
product that's really hard because it's

152
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,879
it's that's that's much harder than

153
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,639
backlog or Sprint backlog right um is to

154
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,800
figure out what percentage of the

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,720
features of your product are actually

156
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,240
used and the the worst is continuing to

157
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,720
invest in features that are of no use

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
right features that aren't used by your

159
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,440
customer cuz I guarantee you loads of

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,120
teams do that uh years years ago um I

161
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,960
worked with a a a a bank in

162
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,919
Boston and um they were absolutely

163
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,039
adamant that this 65% was crap and they

164
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,720
knew their customers way way better than

165
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,360
anybody else um and there's no way they

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
were they were wasting 65% it was a lot

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,000
less that's what they said so we we we

168
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,720
we said to them what's what's your

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,120
Flagship product that you build what's

170
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,120
the product that you think you know your

171
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,720
customers best and are building all the

172
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,800
awesome features like this one this

173
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,639
one's the best so we got in amongst the

174
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,199
code we added application insights app

175
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,240
insights is a an Azure uh uh feature

176
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,479
that can be plugged into any application

177
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,879
anywhere which basically collects data

178
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,199
so it supports all the programming

179
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,560
languages all the setups and you can out

180
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,720
of the box it does a bunch of stuff but

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,479
then if you add this is a feature right

182
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,680
and you can say if some how many times

183
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,640
do users click that button of our body

184
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,680
of users how many of them have clicked

185
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,880
that button you can get all of that data

186
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,919
and we analyzed their their their their

187
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,479
product uh end to end so we collected

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,159
data for 3 months um and then we went

189
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,200
back to them and said here's the 7 and a

190
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,120
half% of features that your customers

191
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,880
use all the rest was waste right um over

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,040
90% of the money they invested in their

193
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,079
product was waste and what was really

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,959
interesting was that more than 80% of

195
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:03,279
the items in their back clog at the

196
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,000
moment we're going towards additional

197
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,760
capabilities for features that weren't

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,600
used by their

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,440
customers right so

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,279
no don't don't don't eat the whole thing

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,680
right you've got to figure out how do I

202
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,200
pick and choose what I'm going to eat

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,200
don't eat the whole feature at once

204
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,279
right you don't know if you like haggus

205
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,120
yet so don't order a whole plate full um

206
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,160
get like a like a starter that's got a

207
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,920
little bit of haggus and try that first

208
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,440
and then obviously when you realize you

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,920
do like it um and your customers like it

210
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,079
then you can make more right but don't

211
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,360
don't over uh uh OV eat um on your

212
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,920
product backlog don't overeat in your

213
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,839
Sprint backlog and don't overeat in the

214
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,360
features in your

215
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,800
product so one of the civil and deadly

216
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,800
sins of agile is greed and this usually

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:07,000
manifest t s in um in

218
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,600
organizations by an overwhelming focus

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,360
on resource

220
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,680
utilization let's let's get rid of the

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,440
fact that we're calling everybody

222
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,760
resources as if they're cogs in a

223
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:22,320
machine rather than actual people right

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,240
but that focus on resource utilization

225
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
was a fantastic idea when we were

226
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,240
running

227
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,240
machines and machines could churn out

228
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,399
things on a regular Cadence and we were

229
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,040
able to the more your machine is running

230
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,120
the more value you're getting in return

231
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,160
for the the cost of the machine and the

232
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,800
cost to run it right um that's how you

233
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,680
would what where that re resource

234
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,920
utilization idea comes from but when you

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,800
start looking at people and how people

236
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:02,399
do work people need a a thinking time

237
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,360
people need uh um do things different

238
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,399
ways right if if we can automate stuff

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,800
that we do the same all the time but if

240
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,760
we're going to do something different

241
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,720
all the time which in my world

242
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,440
background as a software engineer

243
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,360
everything we coded was something new

244
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,000
otherwise we would have used an existing

245
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,040
framework right um so anytime you're

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,560
writing code you're doing something new

247
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,800
anytime you're building a product that

248
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,440
doesn't exist yet you're doing something

249
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,120
new that's never been done before right

250
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,560
so when you're doing those even if it's

251
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,920
been done before by somebody else it's

252
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,800
not been done before by you um and when

253
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,360
you're doing that uh you need to um give

254
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,160
people the space to be able to do things

255
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,800
well to be able to think about things to

256
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,120
be able to learn things to be able to

257
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,600
try things and that means that people

258
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,079
aren't always 100% focused on the work

259
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,639
that they're doing they they're they're

260
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,440
doing other things while thinking about

261
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,800
that work uh some examples Maybe um have

262
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,959
you ever uh been working on something

263
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,560
and got

264
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,480
stuck and the only way for you to get un

265
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,440
no matter how much time you spent on

266
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,959
this thing you were stuck right you're

267
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,639
100% utilized cuz you're working on this

268
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,000
thing

269
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,760
but you're not making any progress

270
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,560
you're not delivering any value but if

271
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,560
you just go uh go out for a walk right

272
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,199
or you sit with your wife and you

273
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,959
explain the problem to your I do this

274
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,560
all the time I explain some problem to

275
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,959
my wife and she doesn't necessarily

276
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,880
understand the problem that I've got

277
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,000
right I'm talking about code and

278
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,760
architectures and things and halfway

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
through explaining it I figured out what

280
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,240
my problem was right cuz I knew I just

281
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,440
didn't have a

282
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,240
moment to look to the side I don't know

283
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,560
if that makes sense like like an out of

284
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,519
body out of idea experience out body

285
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
experience and look at that thing from

286
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,079
the

287
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,240
outside um so that that resource

288
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,360
utilization is a fallacy uh when you're

289
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,720
talking about people um there's no such

290
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,120
thing as resource utilization you want

291
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,480
to be looking at flow efficiency and

292
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,160
value delivery how much value Are you

293
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,160
delivering to your customer and I

294
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,680
actually I don't care if my team members

295
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,959
are sitting around on their butts for

296
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,600
90% of the time as long as we're

297
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:28,639
delivering the value to the customer

298
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,760
right the value to the customer is the

299
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,199
important thing is the customer happy

300
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,560
are we getting an adequate return on

301
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:37,600
investment for our product those are the

302
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,519
ideas uh that make sense um I worked

303
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
with somebody years ago who ran a little

304
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,000
experiment with some teams um that he

305
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:50,199
worked with in a in a company in the US

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,160
and he uh decided to or got convinced

307
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:57,199
leadership that per Sprint he would

308
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,040
remove an

309
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,639
hour from each Sprint

310
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,639
so you can imagine you've got a 40 hour

311
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,800
week per week per Sprint you've got a 40

312
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,360
hour week the next Sprint he's going to

313
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,519
do a 39h hour week with the team and the

314
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,160
Sprint after that he's going to do a 38

315
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,120
hour week with the team and the Sprint

316
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,839
after that he going to do a 37-hour week

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,199
with the team and I've got a question

318
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,040
for you at what point do you believe

319
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,759
that value delivery

320
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,240
suffered if the focus is on value

321
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,120
delivery delivering features now that

322
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,920
doesn't mean that for the other two

323
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,000
hours people aren't the the the the

324
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,800
hours that you remove people aren't

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,079
actually working right if you think

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,720
about it scrum team somebody who's

327
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:51,160
focused on solving problems um works

328
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,600
100% of the time right when I'm when I'm

329
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,959
having a shower in the morning or when

330
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm I actually do a lot of my best ideas

331
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,959
at the gym I go to the gym I'm working

332
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,120
out the gym and I go oh that's a great

333
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,639
idea and I go on my phone and I message

334
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,000
it to myself right and then the next

335
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,839
idea Pops in how to solve problems and

336
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,079
figure these out is not something that

337
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,399
you get from 100% utilization it's you

338
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,720
need thinking time uh so can you guess

339
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,759
where he got to he got to 16 hours per

340
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,399
week before um uh a value delivery

341
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,440
started to suffer because all the rest

342
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,800
of the time is thinking time that the

343
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,240
team needed

344
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,720
thinking in the noodling time um

345
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,319
so very much Stop Being

346
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Greedy stop trying to get people to

347
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:47,759
maximize their utilization and instead

348
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,870
focus on maximizing the flow of value

349
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,240
delivery to your

350
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:57,040
[Applause]

351
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,720
customers one of the seven deadly sins

352
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,079
of agile it's sloth

353
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,279
and this manifests in a number of number

354
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,319
of different ways with with teams with

355
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,759
organizations uh with leadership all

356
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:15,920
over the place um one of the most common

357
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,480
um elements is just not bothering our

358
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,319
bothering our ARS actually doing the

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,360
things um that that that we say we're

360
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:25,639
going to do right we say we're doing

361
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,519
agile but we don't deliver working

362
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,720
product at the end of the Sprint we say

363
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,839
we're doing agile um but we have long

364
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,279
convoluted deployment processes which

365
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,079
are not in control of the developers we

366
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,440
say we're doing agile um but we don't

367
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,480
have an ordered backlog right all of

368
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,160
these things

369
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,600
are places where we say we're doing

370
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,600
something but really we're just kind of

371
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,360
lazy and line through our teeth in order

372
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,440
to not have to do the work perhaps it's

373
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,720
because somebody in leadership in the

374
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,279
organization ation has decided that thou

375
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,720
shalt do Agile and your product is not

376
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
particularly suited to that model

377
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,640
because it was built in a in a

378
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,000
traditional maybe it's got Mainframe and

379
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,199
all kinds of crazy stuff in there maybe

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,079
there are other reasons why it's not

381
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,280
viable within the the the confines the

382
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,880
structure of of of your organization the

383
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,880
system that you're in um but I would

384
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,679
much rather teams and people were honest

385
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,839
and

386
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,400
transparent with their companies and

387
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,000
their organizations

388
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,520
about what they they can and cannot do

389
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,240
what isn't is not agile um I really like

390
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,720
there's a great article

391
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,640
um called uh detecting agile BS uh from

392
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,320
the US Department of the pents and if

393
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:55,360
you search for it you will find

394
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,840
uh a great little workflow on it it's my

395
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,720
one of my favorite uh uh things that I

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,480
use in organiz organizations so here are

397
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,600
uh six sloths uh things that

398
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,600
organizations kind of say they do um or

399
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,480
pretend that they're agile but they

400
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,200
don't actually do these things uh and

401
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,919
this I think these are great uh so first

402
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,240
one is our teams delivering working

403
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,720
software to real users every iteration

404
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,039
including the first and Gathering

405
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,520
feedback that's like that's like the

406
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
first thing that's almost agile in a

407
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,360
nutshell are we coming up with ideas

408
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,480
getting those ideas in front of

409
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,480
customers and getting that feedback if

410
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,320
you're not doing that sloth right you're

411
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,600
you're you're you're not able to get

412
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,200
things done uh the second one and

413
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,200
because this is Department of Defense

414
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,360
right uh is there a product Charter

415
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,360
laying down the mission strategic goals

416
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,080
and do all members of the team

417
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,080
understand how they contribute right

418
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,039
that's absolutely key if how can we

419
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,760
expect people within the context of our

420
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:08,200
of our product of our teams of our

421
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:12,520
organization to make good decisions

422
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:15,039
about what it is uh that they need to do

423
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,679
if they they they they don't have all

424
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,400
the information they need right we're

425
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,880
we're hiring smart clever people and

426
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,240
then we're not empowering

427
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,159
them to do the things that they need to

428
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,400
do right we're not we're just not

429
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,039
empowering them um and that that's

430
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,400
that's part of we need to communicate

431
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,520
with them and if you don't communicate

432
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,360
with them sloth if you don't actually do

433
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:41,080
those things you're you're you're being

434
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:43,679
lazy right just do it uh third one is

435
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,280
feedback uh from users turned into

436
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,440
concrete work items um on Sprint

437
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,080
timeline shorter than one month right so

438
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,600
are you getting uh things in front of

439
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,039
your customers at least once per month

440
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,440
um and

441
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,919
those that that that shouldn't be that

442
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,720
hard right it shouldn't be that hard to

443
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,159
engage uh with your with your with your

444
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,520
customers get parts of your product in

445
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,200
front of your customers and then get

446
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,159
them to tell you what they think of it

447
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,520
right Gathering feedback from from from

448
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,720
those users that shouldn't be that hard

449
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,200
and if you're not doing it sloth cuz

450
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,000
it's not that hard you're just being

451
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,200
lazy uh one I I already mentioned a

452
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,360
little bit uh is the full ecosystem of

453
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,480
your project agile IE agile programming

454
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,280
teams followed by linear bureaucratic

455
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,400
deployments is a failure right why do

456
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,720
you have linear bureaucratic deployments

457
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,440
after your adual team have done the work

458
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,799
yeah we might be able to make working

459
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,200
product in two weeks but how long does

460
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,640
it take before that increment that two

461
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,799
weeks worth of work actually gets in

462
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,400
front of real users so that you can

463
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,320
close those feedback loops break down

464
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
those

465
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,919
assumptions validate what it is that

466
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,360
you're creating that it is actually

467
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,520
value um and if that's too

468
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,960
long that's it's not agile if you look

469
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:11,880
at the agile Manifesto you you it

470
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,320
says ideally a shorter time frame but

471
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,279
only a few months uh between having an

472
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,240
idea and getting it into into production

473
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:23,360
um that should be uh the case and then

474
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,440
the the the fifth one our teams

475
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,760
empowered to change their requirements

476
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,159
based on feedback the the people doing

477
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,640
the work should be able to change and

478
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,440
adapt the requirements that they're

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,279
creating in the system the things that

480
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
they're building we want to build more

481
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,400
of the right things and less of the

482
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,799
wrong things we want to maximize the

483
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,320
amount of work not done all of those

484
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,559
things require the people doing the work

485
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,720
to be able to delete add or change

486
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,360
things from the backlog as needed based

487
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,919
on those interactions that we've already

488
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,120
talked about with the customer and if

489
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,240
you're not doing that sloth right why

490
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,720
are you not doing that why is somebody

491
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,960
not addressing the problems of why you

492
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,799
can't do that if your organization is

493
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,120
saying we want to do Agile year and we

494
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,559
want to get all the benefits oh but you

495
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,279
you can't change your requirements you

496
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,440
have to do everything that here's the

497
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:18,360
300 things we need you to do that's

498
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,120
fundamentally not agile welcome changing

499
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,440
requirements even late in development

500
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,799
these are just fundamental uh uh

501
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,320
principles of agility and then the last

502
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,240
one on the Department of Defense you

503
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,400
know not well known for being an agile

504
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,840
organization but um the last one on

505
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,000
their list is are teams empowered to

506
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,279
change their process based on what they

507
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,440
learn so not only changing the work that

508
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,600
they're doing but changing the way that

509
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,679
they're doing the work and why aren't

510
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,919
your teams empowered to do that well

511
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,279
because people more senior can't be

512
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,200
bothered with that they just want to buy

513
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,919
agile from some vendor install it and

514
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,679
then everybody just does it that way

515
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,960
that's that's not fundamentally how

516
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
agile works

517
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,840
agile is about the emergent practices

518
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,480
The Continuous change emergence and

519
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,679
adaption of our processes practices and

520
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,840
tools in order to be able to maximize

521
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,279
the value delivered to the customer the

522
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,600
stakeholder which maybe the business

523
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,200
themselves right and without those

524
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,320
abilities we can't do that I I I feel

525
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,440
like these six things absolutely impit

526
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,440
omey that's not a

527
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:40,960
word are sloth right if you're not able

528
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,640
to do all of these things you're not

529
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,440
really that interested in moving towards

530
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,000
agility you're really not that

531
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,919
interested in doing those things it's

532
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,360
it's lazy it's inept get off your ass

533
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:53,360
and fix

534
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:02,559
it one of the seven deadly sins of agile

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,240
is wrath wrath occurs in many different

536
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,760
forms uh in teams working in

537
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:12,159
organizations um most often it's the

538
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,480
inability for us to do things wrong it's

539
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,640
the inability for um an organization to

540
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,600
accept that we're not going to do things

541
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,880
right every time Um this can kind of

542
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,360
manifest in um a example from Recently

543
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,320
um we need to work with an organization

544
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,200
we need to create uh some some some

545
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,039
procedures and practices around um doing

546
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
a deployment need to create procedures

547
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:43,440
and practices um and the team that I've

548
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,880
been working with wants to create here's

549
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,360
here's what we think is going to work

550
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,840
let's try that and then as we figure out

551
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,120
more we can iterate on this policy and

552
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,240
procedure and get it to be what we need

553
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,120
it to be in order to be able to to be

554
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,120
successfully in production and then we

555
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,760
can reuse that as we go for for future

556
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,799
applications right future things that

557
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,080
we're doing uh but the the the other

558
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,880
side uh didn't want to do that they

559
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,600
wanted to uh you you create your final

560
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,039
draft we'll take that we'll run it

561
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,240
around the 100 people that need to go

562
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:19,880
see it and we'll create a spreadsheet

563
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,360
with all of the things wrong with it and

564
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,120
here's the things wrong with it that you

565
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,240
have to go fix before we can approve it

566
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:32,919
right that approval process is is Wrath

567
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:36,279
right it's you can't be wrong therefore

568
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,360
the end result needs approved before you

569
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,000
can do it because if it's approved it's

570
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,799
now no longer your accountability so

571
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,600
we're not going to blame you right so

572
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,279
it's a blame culture uh uh uh uh

573
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,080
technique it's going to run up the chain

574
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,279
get approved and then whoever's approved

575
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,200
it at the top it'll be beneath them to

576
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,760
solve the problem anyway so if something

577
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,760
goes wrong oh it's not the people down

578
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,600
here's fault because it was approved

579
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,559
go up who approved it oh the CEO

580
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,640
approved it well okay then well it was

581
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,279
wrong whatever right so there's no

582
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,080
there's no accountability it's a lack of

583
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,080
accountability results in Wrath uh uh

584
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,399
going on in in the

585
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,279
organization and I think this this

586
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,520
manifests in lots of different ways I

587
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,720
think that's the core thing but it

588
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,240
manifests in lots of different ways uh

589
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,520
one of them uh that I've seen happen

590
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,200
with a team uh was um I had it was

591
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,320
during a a Sprint review uh the team was

592
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
demonstrating their product and features

593
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,520
to the

594
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,240
stakeholders and um one of the

595
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,240
stakeholders asked the team why did you

596
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,080
build it that way right in a kind of it

597
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,440
was in a kind of accusatory tone like

598
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,679
why did you build it that way right like

599
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,640
kind of kind of like that and what I

600
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,760
would expect to happen would be that the

601
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,200
product owner would take accountability

602
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,559
for the value value delivered

603
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,559
accountability for the value delivered

604
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,679
in the team and they would get out in

605
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,399
front of that and say well these are the

606
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,360
decisions that we made we can always go

607
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,120
back and change them um blah blah blah

608
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,000
blah blah that's taking accountability

609
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,000
but no that's not what they did um wrath

610
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,120
they passed the buck and the product

611
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,840
owner turned to the team and said no why

612
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,080
did you build it that way right and

613
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,720
that's that's not taking accountability

614
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,760
and I think wrath is a is a big reason I

615
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,399
don't want it to be my fault it needs to

616
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,200
be somebody else's fault otherwise

617
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,880
something will land on me I'll get

618
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,360
covered in the poop uh uh from the from

619
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,279
the mistake that happens um and I think

620
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,399
that lack of mistakes is a huge huge

621
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,480
part of that story so don't let your

622
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:51,399
organizational culture of

623
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,679
Wrath create this environment where

624
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,679
nobody will take

625
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,960
accountability one of the seven deadly

626
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,480
sin

627
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,399
of agile is

628
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:10,760
envy and for me I think

629
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:12,919
Envy in agile looks like um just copying

630
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,799
other people's stuff right that's one of

631
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:19,480
the the the ways it

632
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:22,159
manifests that um we we we believe we

633
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,640
maybe believe that if somebody else is

634
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,120
getting success with something then of

635
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,679
course we will get success with

636
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,279
something and the difficulty is that

637
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,039
that's not necessarily true at all um

638
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,000
and it I'm going to rephrase that it

639
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,519
might be it might be it might be

640
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,360
possible on the small scale right so

641
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,919
you're you're you're working with a with

642
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,480
a team um one of your colleagues and

643
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,960
another scrum master or another product

644
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,080
owner is using a practice that they're

645
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,039
like oh this is great we do this and

646
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,480
this and we have this value stream and

647
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,399
we're able to to to get good good stuff

648
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,600
from that and you're like okay I'd like

649
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,000
to try that

650
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,200
right that's that's not really what I

651
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,440
consider Envy that's just trying

652
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,799
stuff Envy would be um looking at a

653
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,559
great example of Envy Spotify

654
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:20,320
model Spotify model is a fantastic

655
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:23,000
example of Envy there is no such thing

656
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,720
as the Spotify model there is no such

657
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,760
thing uh so there was a

658
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,760
presentation uh and paper uh that a

659
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,080
couple of folks that were were leaders

660
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:38,600
in at Spotify did at a conference uh so

661
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,279
I think they did a couple of conferences

662
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,360
talking

663
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:46,919
about what Spotify was

664
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,960
doing what their Journey was and where

665
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:51,080
they currently were on their

666
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,240
Journey right that was they're they're

667
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,120
they're telling an example of how they

668
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,760
did things and everybody went ooh the

669
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
Spotify model

670
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,080
let's let's do that and they absorb that

671
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,120
into their you know I I want this uh uh

672
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,440
um this capability and they go try and

673
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,480
bring it into the organization but what

674
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,320
folks don't realize is 6 weeks later

675
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,120
Spotify were doing it differently they

676
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,799
weren't doing what was defined in the

677
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:26,080
Spotify Model A year later they got rid

678
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:29,039
of the idea of of tribes and uh uh

679
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,720
guilds and whatever else they were doing

680
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,840
because it it didn't it didn't work for

681
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,080
them right they tried something and it

682
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:39,039
didn't work for them and that that Envy

683
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,960
of oh they're doing this awesome thing

684
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,080
so we need to be doing that awesome

685
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,240
thing I think it results in a lot of it

686
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,519
results in a lot of fomo if you've heard

687
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,240
that expression fear of missing out I

688
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,600
think that's kind of part of of Envy

689
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,919
other people are getting stuff and you

690
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,240
want the same

691
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,639
stuff and that's where where at many

692
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:06,639
levels organizations fail so they fail

693
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:11,039
at the the the the process level right

694
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:13,720
because you you look at um a a a Spotify

695
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,320
model or you look at safe or you look at

696
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:20,039
any of those big uh uh uh uh models and

697
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,679
say I I want that I want to install that

698
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,159
in my organization and then you pay lots

699
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,639
of money to get it installed and then

700
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,159
wonder why you know you're not getting

701
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:29,720
the benefit uh there's the the

702
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:33,279
application level um I talked about this

703
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,000
recently on a on a podcast um that the

704
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,320
installing an application that enshrines

705
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,919
somebody else's business processes into

706
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,320
your organization is not necessarily

707
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,960
going to be successful for you right so

708
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,000
the example I used before was um sap

709
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,480
right sap is a a massive application

710
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,320
tool very common in our industry but if

711
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,279
you if you adopt a sap tool right sap

712
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,000
comes with a bunch of different

713
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,120
capabilities so let's say it's let's say

714
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,960
it's invoice processing let's say it's

715
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,080
invoice processing right sap has a

716
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,519
workflow for invoice processing that

717
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,960
comes out of the box it has certain ways

718
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:18,320
that it does things and you're giving up

719
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,120
the way your organization does things in

720
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,440
order to adopt the way sap does things

721
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,480
does that kind of make sense that like

722
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,919
there are some things that you can adapt

723
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,720
in sap but only Within the bounds of

724
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,480
what the developers that created it

725
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,519
allow which means that when you see some

726
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,960
of your

727
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,080
competitors um perhaps installing sap

728
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,039
and building their whole procurement

729
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,679
processes in sap you think oh we need to

730
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,519
do that if they're doing that we need to

731
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,399
do that or if our competitors are adding

732
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,639
these features to our product we need to

733
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,720
add those features to our product and

734
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:59,840
that that's that's that's following

735
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,080
that's Envy right that's following not

736
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,279
building your own path uh Simon syc does

737
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:10,240
a great video uh that is on this topic

738
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:13,120
and he talks about the the the the why

739
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,120
you know start with why and he talks

740
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,600
about going to two uh conferences one's

741
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,960
a Microsoft conference under Balmer uh

742
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,000
and one's a Apple conference and at the

743
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,919
Microsoft conference everybody wanted to

744
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,240
know what their competitors were doing

745
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,559
what are their competitors doing what

746
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,840
are their competitors saying uh uh what

747
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,000
are they what are they launching what

748
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,919
features do they have at the Apple

749
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
conference they didn't give a crap about

750
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,480
what the competitors were doing they're

751
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,200
like this is the way we're going we're

752
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,799
doing this cuz it fits within our belief

753
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,240
model generos generosity Comfort

754
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,000
confidence contentedness friendliness

755
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,480
goodwi

756
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:57,399
kindness benevolence friendship those

757
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,559
are the the Opposites of of of envy and

758
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:04,559
I think think that that if you can put

759
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,240
aside what everybody else is doing and

760
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,879
focus on what do you need to do and what

761
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,119
do your customers need um you'll have a

762
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,280
lot better time both in the process

763
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,119
space in the in the tool space and in

764
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,240
your organizational structure

765
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,280
space one of the seven deadly sins of

766
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,919
agile is

767
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,399
pride now you do want to take pride in

768
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:33,040
your work we all want to do good things

769
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,679
we want to believe that the things that

770
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,879
we create are

771
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:42,240
valued but I think the pride that's the

772
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:45,679
sin part is blind Pride you're taking

773
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,760
pride in something without actually

774
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,000
measuring its outcome right we talk

775
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,720
about this all the time for for for

776
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,560
product owners don't just build stuff

777
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,119
willy-nilly you need to collect the data

778
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,280
the Telemetry the analysis you have to

779
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,720
do hypothesis you have to create the

780
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,480
hypothesis I think this thing if I build

781
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,599
it is going to add

782
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,560
value you create it and you don't just

783
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,920
assume that it's going to make the value

784
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,440
that you think it is that's Pride

785
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,400
talking you need to analyze the data and

786
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,880
figure out if that actually did provide

787
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,480
the value You're Expecting and you need

788
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,400
to stop investing in something that

789
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,280
isn't providing the return that you're

790
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:35,680
EXP expecting it to do another good

791
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:39,240
example of that uh is is uh Satia

792
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,839
writing down the cost of Windows phone

793
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,400
right writing off Nokia for for 8

794
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:49,040
billion sometimes you have to swallow

795
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,000
your pride and not sink more money into

796
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,079
something that's not going to provide a

797
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,319
return and you just have to stop um I

798
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,599
used to work at a at a bank um in the UK

799
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,359
in uh near Edinburgh and they created

800
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,280
they had this massive piece of software

801
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,240
that basically all it did was create

802
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,920
forms for customers to fill out but it

803
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,240
was the most

804
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,280
convoluted unusable

805
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,319
unwieldly um I don't know I I'm trying

806
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,440
to think of more words to describe this

807
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,319
Ridiculousness of this this software um

808
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,040
it

809
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:28,359
was didn't provide the features that

810
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,200
they actually

811
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:36,119
needed but they'd spent 2 million on

812
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,440
building it so they must use it we must

813
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,680
continue to use it that's that sunk cost

814
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,160
fallacy right which I think is very

815
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,280
closely related to Pride while we've

816
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,119
invested this much money it must be

817
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,079
awesome so we must use it um and those

818
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,839
are assumptions yeah I think pride pride

819
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:58,079
is how come we we assume stuff we assume

820
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,560
lots of things

821
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,160
the product owner assuming that the

822
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,400
features the ideas that they have are

823
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:08,560
good ones right the market doesn't

824
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:11,520
always agree um developers building

825
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,520
things in a

826
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,520
way that entertains

827
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,720
them rather than that actually focuses

828
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,280
on the value delivered to the business

829
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,119
um I've been guilty of that many times

830
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,240
of working on features because they were

831
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,480
fun not because they provided any value

832
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:36,400
to the the customer um done that a ton

833
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,000
um so you need to be really uh uh

834
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,760
careful that you don't become too

835
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,720
prideful make assumptions about the

836
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,359
products and capabilities that you're

837
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,920
building the code that you're writing

838
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:53,400
the the the the stories that you tell in

839
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,319
such a way that it clouds your view of

840
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,240
what's really going on right because

841
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,599
then all you're looking at is Vanity

842
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,000
metrics you're you're missing out on

843
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:06,960
what's really going on so don't be so

844
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,400
prideful that you miss out on what's

845
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,400
really going

846
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,359
