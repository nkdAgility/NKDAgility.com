The intended audience (Agile practitioners/team leads) is somewhat adjacent to Agentic Engineering's, but the primary intent is practical performance measurement, not deliberate agency-centric engineering design. No explicit penalties were assessed, as the tone and material are current and supportive.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece critiques traditional Agile metrics and promotes more effective value-based measurements, which modestly align with focus areas of Agentic Engineering. However, it lacks direct reference or discussion of agency maximization, autonomy, or systemic engineering philosophy, keeping overall category fit low.",
    "level": "Ignored"
