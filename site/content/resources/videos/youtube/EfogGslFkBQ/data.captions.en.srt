1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,120
if you are working on an agile team and

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:10,200
you're focused on story points and

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,839
velocity then you're probably an agile

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,720
Bandit um story points and velocity has

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,240
a really negative impact on our ability

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,039
to deliver for many teams I know there

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,480
are going to be lots of people that and

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,880
you're welcome to comment um that story

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,240
points and velocity works great for you

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,640
uh I'm I'm sure that are teams out there

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,120
I have yet to meet a team that uses

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
story points or velocity uh that got a

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,000
positive benefit from it um and that's

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,120
from observing many many many teams um

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,559
it creates uh uh um lot lots of little

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,559
negative niggles like um getting Point

17
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,960
wanting to put things in the Sprint to

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,280
get the points right oh we're going to

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,359
have a we're going to put a bug in the

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,719
Sprint how many points is this worth so

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,600
that we can get our points at the end of

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,119
this Sprint and the point becomes the

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,200
points we don't want the point to be the

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,560
points we want the point to be the value

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,119
that we deliver for our customers the

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,159
points are irrelevant the points are

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,320
just a tool to help us as developers on

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
a team have a

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,439
conversation about what we know and what

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,880
we don't and our understanding and to

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,439
gain more understanding that's the point

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,960
of any estimation for complex cognitive

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,079
work where You' you're building a brand

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,159
new product that doesn't exist yet you

35
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,960
want to be focused on the flow of work

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,159
through your system and throughput and

37
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,520
cycle time those are the metrics you're

38
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:50,040
looking for story points and velocity

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,759
are terrible metrics for teams to look

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,880
at and I I do there are lots of teams uh

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,880
uh especially brand new teams who have

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,560
never done anything before that

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,399
definitely get encouraged to move down

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,479
the story Point route and I I just it's

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,280
a bad idea um ditch the story points

46
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:15,400
from the start focus on Flow metrics

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:20,680
cycle time throughput go there um I did

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,080
have a a customer recently um who

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,599
made the

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:31,560
biggest agile banditry mistake I have

51
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,319
ever seen and that was that story points

52
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,640
were in the contract with the

53
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,080
customer they were

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,000
mandated to do story Point estimation

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,680
UPF front to provide that story Point

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,080
estimation to the customer and the

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,640
customer would measure the team based on

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,480
the number of story points that they

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,239
delivered and if you were out with a 15%

60
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,239
standard deviation of the number of

61
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,440
story points you normally deliver then

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,200
you were in trouble and potentially in

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,760
breach of contract with penalties that

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,760
come along with it I can't think of a

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,840
better way for everybody to just make up

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,560
whatever they needed in order to

67
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,560
complete the contract right you're not

68
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,120
going to get transparency there you're

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,720
not going to be able to see what's going

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
on those story points are not going to

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,239
be the story points that you want them

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,799
to be um even if you could possibly get

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,720
there which I don't think you can ditch

74
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
story points don't have them in

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,560
contracts H don't ever talk about story

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,080
points outside of the team if you want

77
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,360
to do um planning poker uh and sit with

78
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,920
a with a team on a team and do planning

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,680
poker fantastic uh great tool to help us

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
as a team collaborate and figure out

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,640
what we don't know but at the end of

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,519
that event at the end of that meeting

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,920
delete all the data it is of no value

84
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,079
whatsoever beyond our understanding of

85
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,360
the need to bring break things down

86
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,760
that's what estimation is about it's not

87
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,360
about story points and it's not about

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,799
velocity and product owners should not

89
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,959
be using velocity to monit monitor teams

90
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:18,239
that way lies agile banditry so you

91
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,280
should avoid being agile Bandits and

92
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,160
instead of focusing on story points and

93
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,960
velocity subjective matrics focus more

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,240
on objective metrics like throughput and

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,080
cycle time

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,280
don't be agile Bandits if you're being

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,639
ambushed by agile bandits in your

98
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,400
organization then my team at naked

99
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,600
agility can help you or we can help you

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,120
find a consultant or expert who can you

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
can set up a no obligation consultation
