1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,059
so the question is what is my primary

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,059
role in a devops Consulting geek

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,859
and I think that's a difficult question

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,800
to answer without the context because I

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,359
find it depends very heavily on on where

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,640
the customer is what they're trying to

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,900
do what they hired you for and what

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,460
their problem is

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:34,440
but if maybe quantifying that that that

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,520
primary goal as to to provoke the

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,120
customer

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,000
into thinking about

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:45,600
how the

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,780
manage and deliver the work that they do

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,579
and how their this the system that they

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,860
have in place that delivers that work

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,360
and can be disrupted for their benefit

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,000
right

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,100
so devops is is about optimizing that

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,100
flow of value

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,220
from idea all the way through to to to

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,900
the to to the to the customers of that

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,220
product and then and then closing that

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,920
feedback loop right getting that

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,780
feedback back into the system

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,340
so what what is it that's getting in the

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,020
way of that find find the thing that's

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,600
taking the longest in that process and

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,979
go poke at it and pick at it and that

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,040
could be

31
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,920
um a technical Focus right a tool issue

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,259
the the all the builds are taking 24

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,720
hours to do all the testing well that's

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,079
too long right how do we go go fix that

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,659
or that could be a people problem uh

36
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,159
this this this uh approval needs to

37
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,860
happen but the person who does the

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,159
approval only does it once every uh two

39
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,740
weeks so if you if if you get the timing

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,420
wrong right you're just waiting for that

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,159
approval in order to be able to close

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,740
that feedback loop that's just waste

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,020
that's wasted time so how do you find

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,540
those things so I think that would be my

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,579
my focus
