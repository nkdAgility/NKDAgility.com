    "reasoning": "The content discusses the DevOps consultant's role in optimising value flow to the end customer, mentioning the importance of feedback loops and delivering value from idea to customer. However, it largely focuses on internal bottleneck resolution, process improvement, and efficiency, with only brief references to closing the feedback loop with customers. There's no deep exploration of measuring value specifically from the customer's perspective or using customer outcomes to guide all decisions, but customer value is mentioned as an end goal. The discussion is somewhat aligned conceptually yet falls short of directly engaging with actionable, evidence-based customer focus and prioritisation. The target audience aligns with practitioners interested in DevOps and improvement.",
