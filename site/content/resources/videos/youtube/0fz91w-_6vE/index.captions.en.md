So the question is, what is my primary role in a DevOps consulting gig? I think that's a difficult question to answer without the context because I find it depends very heavily on where the customer is, what they're trying to do, what they hired you for, and what their problem is. 

But if maybe quantifying that primary goal is to provoke the customer into thinking about how they manage and deliver the work that they do and how the system that they have in place delivers that work and can be disrupted for their benefit, right? 

So DevOps is about optimising that flow of value from idea all the way through to the customers of that product and then closing that feedback loop, right? Getting that feedback back into the system. 

So what is it that's getting in the way of that? Find the thing that's taking the longest in that process and go poke at it and pick at it. And that could be a technical focus, right? A tool issue. The builds are taking 24 hours to do all the testing. Well, that's too long, right? How do we go fix that? 

Or that could be a people problem. This approval needs to happen, but the person who does the approval only does it once every two weeks. So if you get the timing wrong, right, you're just waiting for that approval in order to be able to close that feedback loop. That's just waste. That's wasted time. 

So how do you find those things? So I think that would be my focus.
