1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,840
so the the question was how is waterfall

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,860
how is agile product development

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,880
different

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,880
from waterfall

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,240
yeah that's actually quite that

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,100
defining the difference between agile

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,460
project management and waterfall is

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,660
actually quite a difficult task because

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,960
most agile teams that I encounter are

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,820
really agile under a waterfall if we

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,820
take that idea of waterfall and say well

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,340
it's it waterfall is just a symptom what

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,500
is the actual thing you actually need to

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,320
go back to the the Industrial Revolution

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,600
and the tayloristic practices that

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,000
created that in the first place right a

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,460
whole bunch of ways of working of how

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,960
business should operate and how we

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,699
should manage people was developed

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,579
during the Industrial Revolution to

21
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,379
manage a largely uneducated Workforce so

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,320
all of those practices were designed

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,920
around that idea and then we move into

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,780
the the the modern world and most agile

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
teams still operate in an organization

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,720
which uses those practices

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,040
so while they can get benefit from the

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,900
iterative nature of agile right so we we

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,520
take this big thing that we know we're

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,560
going to develop and we break it down

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,720
into smaller things they are going to

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,119
get benefit from that right

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,400
um instead of everything happening at

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,780
the end and huge amounts of risk we're

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,700
getting a little piece at a time

36
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,380
mitigating the risk of the product

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,299
because we have usable working product

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,880
every every Sprint right so we're

39
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,280
getting that that iterative but we don't

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,439
get incremental because we're still

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,119
building towards the same

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,799
product that they asked for at the

43
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,420
beginning they asked for a thousand

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,100
things at the end of it we're going to

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,960
deliver a thousand things and we can

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,299
either deliver it once at the end or

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,820
lots of times in between

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,299
um but true agility

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,640
comes from that decentralization and

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,640
democratization of the way the business

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,180
operates so that they take advantage of

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,379
their Highly Educated Workforce that

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,959
they didn't have before when the old

54
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,640
practices were created so everybody in

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,319
your organization is working towards

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,840
delivering value for your business

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,599
helping your customers

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,700
engaging with the market and reacting to

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,980
the market rather than it just all

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,459
coming from the top with steering and

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,560
budgets and control right so so this I I

62
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,780
feel like there's two answers to your

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,980
question right two answers to the

64
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,280
question of what's the difference

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,080
between waterfall and agile is

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,519
in a traditional organizational

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,800
structure

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:56,280
agile increases agile reduces the risk

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,440
of non-delivery it reduces the risk that

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,819
we're going to deliver the wrong thing

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,739
but until the organization

72
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,739
adapts the decentralization practices

73
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,980
and does things like let's allow the

74
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,260
team to change whatever requirement is

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,840
required to change that didn't make any

76
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,819
sense but allow them to change the

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,420
requirements based on what they learn

78
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,819
allow them to change their processes

79
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,700
based on what they learn will never get

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:31,220
that leap into that true exponential

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,220
power of agility which is how

82
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,440
delivering not only high quality but

83
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,420
also delivering more of the right stuff

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,879
and less of the wrong stuff although

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,920
there's a great metric from um uh if

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,840
it's the Standish group in in Boston

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,420
they're kind of data analytics group

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,459
they analyze about 70 000 projects

89
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,200
worldwide and put out our chaos report

90
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,580
every year

91
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,860
um about how agile's doing and one of

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,500
the things that they found was that only

93
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,120
only 35 of the features that we build in

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,260
products are actually used by our

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,040
customers

96
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,840
right and and that is

97
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,340
intrinsically because when we say to the

98
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,939
customer

99
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,680
we we want some stuff

100
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,120
for us to do

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,940
we're going to build a product for you

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,739
let me start that part again when we say

103
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,680
to the customer we're going to build a

104
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,380
product for you right uh what do you

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,120
need the customer goes oh what you know

106
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't know what I need okay well

107
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
here's what I need now here's 300 things

108
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,660
I need now so they all end up on the

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,300
product backlog and and then they say

110
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,520
Well if you know we've got some business

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,800
decisions coming up and I actually think

112
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,780
about it like the the Multiverse of

113
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,419
Multiverse of Madness right you remember

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,340
Loki in Marvel you've got those all

115
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,440
those branching different decisions that

116
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,360
happen in a business and down every

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,340
branch in the decision making in our

118
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,600
business different features are required

119
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,100
sometimes it's the same features

120
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,900
sometimes it's a subtle difference that

121
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,240
we can handle but sometimes it's quite a

122
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,400
big difference so until the business

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,040
actually makes that decision in the

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,840
future they need the 50 to 50 features

125
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,220
from this route and they need the 50

126
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,320
features from that route until they

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,120
actually make that decision and how many

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,100
decisions is it good like that is the

129
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,840
business going to make over the next 12

130
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,820
months if we're doing a 12-month

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
delivery so they put all of those you

132
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,639
know there's another thousand features

133
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,900
that they find all across the business

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,979
for all these different branching

135
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,060
decisions and they put that on the

136
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,039
backlog

137
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,660
how many of those do we actually need

138
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,699
when we get to the end

139
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,160
how many of those are actually valuable

140
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,380
when we get to the end how many of the

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,840
200 feet or 300 I think I said 300

142
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,460
features they give us at the start are

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,419
going to be no longer relevant in a

144
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,060
year's time

145
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,740
how many of those branches did we take

146
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,660
this route and now there's a whole tree

147
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,539
of features down this route that are no

148
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:51,120
longer valuable that's by only 35 of the

149
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:53,039
features that we build are are you are

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,020
actually used by our customers and

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,840
that's an industry average your company

152
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,220
might be way worse right

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,960
um and I've worked with those companies

154
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,580
that think that they know their

155
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,860
customers better and think their

156
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,840
customers use all of that but until they

157
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,080
actually add Telemetry to their product

158
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,699
and understand what percentage of their

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,340
features in their product customers

160
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,900
actually use they don't realize how bad

161
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,860
the situation is and how much money

162
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,860
they're actually wasting
