There are no direct or indirect references to SLE's elapsed time range, probability-focused forecasts, or the use of historical cycle time data. The intent is broad education on agile vs. waterfall, not analysis or guidance around SLE. The depth and audience are somewhat relevant since an agile audience might encounter SLE, but there is no content focus, mention, or substantial alignment.
