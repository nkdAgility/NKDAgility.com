1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,680
one of the myths in uh scrum is that we

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,360
have have no

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,880
governance um this kind of leads on to

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,880
the bigger myth that just because it's

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,840
not in the scrum guide um doesn't mean

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,439
you're not supposed to do it um scrum

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,400
does absolutely have have governments it

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,480
has small amounts of governance baked in

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,640
right but in general you need governance

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,560
to build your product so it's kind of

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,519
correct to say scrum doesn't have a lot

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
of govern

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,079
right there's a very small amount of

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,399
governance built in but if you want to

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,559
be successful at Building Products if

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,600
you're for example Building Products

17
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,039
within the health care space then you're

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,199
you're going to have to worry about your

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,000
ability to support Hippa to support the

20
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,800
Regulatory Compliance that comes from

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,879
the outside don't that's governance

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,320
imposed on your organization from the

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,440
outside that you have no control of um

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,920
you're going to have um things that your

25
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,400
organization does internally perhaps uh

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,920
your organization has usability

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,840
guidelines perhaps they have um uh uh uh

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,880
like ux guidelines for here's how our

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,920
all our products ux is going to function

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,079
so that anybody interacting with our

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,200
software already knows how it's going to

32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,280
work because it follows the same rules

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,360
um then that's internal governance that

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,079
has been applied to your product you

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,960
maybe have a business um rules that are

36
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,040
another form of governance you might

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,159
have particular ways in which you

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,640
interact with the market as a business

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
that's your unique uh one of your unique

40
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,520
selling points your unique engagement

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,520
points with the market and they have

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,479
those those ways of working have to be

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,240
implemented in your systems in that way

44
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,240
that's internal

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,000
governance just

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,680
because scrum talks

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,920
about um minimizing that governance

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,679
doesn't mean it's not there right you

49
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,400
just you have just enough governance to

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,560
support the business need um it's when

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,800
you have way too much governance that

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,879
you start running into a problem that's

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,239
why in very large organizations for

54
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,319
example Banks right they really struggle

55
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:32,080
to move towards uh scrum and agile

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,680
practices because they're encumbered by

57
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,040
the baggage that they can't put down uh

58
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,760
Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK was the

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,440
I think it was the first bank in the

60
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,640
world it's currently the fifth biggest

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,159
bank in the world um and they've been

62
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,080
going for over 200 years can you imagine

63
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,000
the the the the procedural and

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,159
compliance baggage that that

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,519
organization has many of it around for

66
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,200
no other reason than nobody's Revisited

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,519
it in a long time nobody's challenged it

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,159
in a really long time how many policies

69
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,440
and procedures do you have in your

70
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,560
organization that nobody knows where

71
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,080
they came from or what they're for or

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,040
who owns that policy or procedure or why

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
right it's just the way we do things

74
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,319
here those are the things that we want

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,959
to challenge we want to challenge

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,879
anything that gets in the way of inh

77
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,239
inhibiting our ability to deliver value

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,959
those are the things we want to prevent

79
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,560
those are the uh policies practices and

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,879
procedures the governance that we want

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,040
to reduce to the absolute minimum thanks
