    "reasoning": "The content focuses on Scrum and governance, emphasizing Agile's compatibility with regulatory compliance and internal standards. There is no discussion of agentic software delivery concepts: no mention or exploration of AI agents, contextual intelligence, or human/AI collaboration. Governance is discussed only in the traditional sense—process, compliance, and maintaining standards within Scrum. The intended audience is Agile practitioners, which is closer to the Agentic Software Delivery audience, but without any conceptual overlap with agentic intelligence or delivery. No obsolete or contradictory references are present. The fit is very tenuous, hence the low confidence.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses Scrum and governance but lacks discussion of autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic delivery concepts. It does not fit the Agentic Software Delivery category beyond very broad process overlap.",
