However, while discussing these tenets, it does not provide in-depth, specific actionable rules that directly fall under the strict definition of 'tenets,' leading to a moderate confidence score.",

While it touches on the importance of governance in product development, it does not convey enduring competencies or strategies for developing capabilities within teams. The content's emphasis is more on the practical aspects of governance rather than cultivating systemic capabilities, leading to a lower alignment and depth of discussion regarding capability as defined in the category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is a myth-busting article addressing governance misconceptions in Scrum. At no point is Service Level Expectation (SLE) mentioned, referenced, or alluded to either explicitly or through discussion of related concepts (forecasting throughput, cycle time analysis, or predictability in work item completion). The central themes revolve around compliance, regulatory standards, organizational policies, and balancing these with Scrum's Agile principles. None of the key SLE topics or exclusions (such as SLA focus or generic cycle/lead time topics) are addressed; the discussion is consistently anchored in governance. The intent, depth, and audience are not misaligned with Agile practitioners, but strong divergence from the SLE scope leads to very low scores across all dimensions. Penalties were applied for lack of mention, depth, and significant off-topic content. The resulting confidence score properly reflects an essentially irrelevant classification for the SLE category.",
