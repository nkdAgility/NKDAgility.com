14
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,440
the the

15
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,039
um the icebreaker i think this is gonna

16
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,680
be a harder one today absolutely

17
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
so welcome to uh

18
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,319
an introduction

19
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
to kanban uh workshop let me just find

20
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,680
who's making all the noise i think

21
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
they've muted themselves

22
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
uh so i think

23
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
everybody

24
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
gordon will let me know everybody should

25
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,120
have permission to mute everybody else

26
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,560
please use that power responsibly

27
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,960
like if i'm saying something you don't

28
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,280
like it's not okay to go mute me

29
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,479
right um but

30
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,240
it does

31
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,680
i'm pretty sure i have that

32
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,880
enabled so if you do see somebody with

33
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
this get some background noise or

34
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
whatever then um it's okay to go music

35
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
so i only see the

36
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
martin when i click on somebody yeah

37
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,440
martin when i do click on somebody

38
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,400
uh yeah okay i'm i'm ah right okay so

39
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,039
let me

40
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
go find gordon

41
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,199
there's gordon

42
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,560
i'm gonna promote you to a presenter

43
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
there we go

44
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
that way that way you have the power

45
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
well and you can you can help me out

46
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,319
with that that muting stuff there we go

47
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
that solves that problem

48
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
uh so then we managed to get into the

49
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,840
mural i can see there are 12 people

50
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,280
on the mural but there are

51
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,080
27 people

52
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,639
in

53
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
the call so make sure that you check the

54
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,759
chat

55
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,599
and head into the mural if you find it

56
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,479
in the chat i've set up a new um

57
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,960
um crazy thing uh

58
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,800
a kind of community portal and the links

59
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,479
to the mural um are on there as well

60
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,880
um so if you you should be able to get

61
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,319
access to that i saw a few of you pop in

62
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
uh earlier

63
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,960
george was poking around trying to

64
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
see what what the heck is this crazy

65
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
thing that martin's doing now

66
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
um sometimes you have to run an

67
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,919
experiment and sometimes experiments

68
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,560
don't go well

69
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,720
uh so the the using teams

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,479
um was okay

71
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,680
from a functionality well i wasn't

72
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,360
really okay from a functionality

73
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
perspective it was okay from uh from a

74
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,400
things working perspective but some

75
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,360
people lost emails

76
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
uh

77
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
some people didn't get the invites and

78
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
ended up in trash folders that kind of

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,199
sucks there's no kind of web-based way

80
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,080
to get the invites and

81
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
um

82
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,280
the other way of registering on my

83
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,840
website just really

84
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,879
wasn't a good idea

85
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
um

86
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,160
it's okay for selling tickets for

87
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,240
classes uh but it's not okay for for

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,440
everybody else trying to just i just

89
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,440
want to join a workshop that's free

90
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
um so i have

91
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
um

92
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,919
set up something else and i'll use that

93
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,599
next time and i'm going to use it for

94
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,560
some of my classes going forward as well

95
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,920
so we'll see how that how that works out

96
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
all right so i'm going to

97
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
um

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,120
just unlock

99
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
uh let me summon everybody summon i've

100
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,800
summoned the 15 people

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,000
that have managed to get into the mural

102
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
so far

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,959
and i am unlocking

104
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,640
all of the little let's see i need to

105
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,519
get a little space that doesn't have a

106
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,959
little

107
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,640
padlock on it there we go uh so here

108
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,920
i've got a little uh

109
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
icebreaker

110
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,120
and everybody that's been before knows

111
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,880
the deal you grab a little ticker across

112
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,279
and whether you agree with the statement

113
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,800
but this this week it is a little bit

114
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,959
more complicated

115
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,040
gordon said this was all too easy so i

116
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
decided to make it a little bit more

117
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,000
complicated so you can blame gordon um

118
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,000
and there are two types of tiles here

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
there's 10 questions

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,240
five of them are purely kanban focused

121
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
and five of them are scrum

122
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
with kanban

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
focused

124
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,839
so i have hopefully

125
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,720
clearly marked them i understand

126
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,800
that

127
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
that doesn't always work out the way i

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
think i've marked them and the way

129
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
people see it

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
um but it's basically the the odd

131
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
numbered ones

132
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
are

133
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,440
um

134
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,079
kanban and the even numbered ones are

135
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
strong with kanban so read the statement

136
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,040
grab a tick or a cross

137
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
and whether you believe it to be a true

138
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,480
or false statement

139
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,480
um

140
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
and drop it

141
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
onto onto the

142
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
onto the thing some of them are i have

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,800
managed to make sure that some of them

144
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,480
are true and some of them are false so

145
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
there should definitely be some things

146
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,120
going on

147
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
don't

148
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,720
there's no blank one this time

149
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
yeah there's no black one this time i

150
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,959
actually managed to

151
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
to

152
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,519
to get i was checking it earlier do you

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,279
know what i was checking it an hour ago

154
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
and i had five blank ones because i'd

155
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,000
only done half of it

156
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,760
so i had to go and figure out how to how

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
to get all of all of those things on

158
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,120
there or just what i wanted to put on

159
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,160
there

160
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,800
so as as usual at the end of the

161
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,040
um ice breaker or as usual i've done it

162
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,800
once before um i am going to

163
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
close

164
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,800
the meeting so people can't join it

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,320
um this is we've had a not a lot of

166
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
disruption when we're trying to do

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,839
breakout rooms i just posted the mural

168
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,440
again

169
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,160
um

170
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
when we try to do breakout rooms um

171
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
teams can get very confused when people

172
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,240
are dropping in and dropping out and

173
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,200
um i think it's same with zoom just gets

174
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,240
confused so i'm gonna lock it and then

175
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
um so unfortunately that does mean if

176
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
you

177
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,000
do get disconnected

178
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,279
um you probably won't be able to just

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
rejoin

180
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,600
uh because the meeting will then be

181
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,480
closed i am really sorry if that's the

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
case

183
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
uh but you can watch the live stream um

184
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
it's just too disruptive to have people

185
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,079
dropping in and out all the time

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,040
especially when we're doing pairing and

187
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,519
various breakout room formats

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,519
cool it's interesting

189
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,040
that was definitely some contentious

190
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,040
ones

191
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,839
so i i always think back when i'm trying

192
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,560
to come up with some of these questions

193
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,160
i always think back not just to

194
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,000
what what what

195
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
people ask

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,320
me or ask

197
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
at

198
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,839
some of the events but also um what i

199
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,720
thought right because

200
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,839
i get things wrong as well and i

201
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,240
uh understand things differently and i

202
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,839
have been quite often berated by daniel

203
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,360
vicanti for uh getting some of the the

204
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,600
kanban parts

205
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,839
incorrect and

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,160
we we have a good argument about which

207
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,839
way it is and usually he wins because

208
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
you know it's daniel

209
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,120
usually wins

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,680
um

211
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,839
so i'm going to give it uh uh another

212
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,200
couple of minutes just to

213
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,320
get everybody

214
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,600
on here let's see we have 26

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
people in

216
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
uh

217
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,399
the

218
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
mural

219
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,200
and how many people do we have in the in

220
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
the meeting itself

221
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,120
29 that's pretty close that's pretty

222
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,279
close

223
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,839
so most people are able to to to

224
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,920
participate

225
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,000
um if you're if you're just want to sit

226
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,560
at the back and not say anything you can

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
always join the live stream it's uh this

228
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
is streaming on

229
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,079
youtube and linkedin

230
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,320
maybe facebook i can't remember whether

231
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,639
that'll work or not and but everybody's

232
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
getting to look at gordon at the moment

233
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,000
um

234
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,279
just the way it works sometimes it kind

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,600
of flicks between whoever's uh

236
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
it's complicated when you're using teams

237
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
to do some of this stuff and i think

238
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,320
it's actually quite good because then

239
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
everybody's not

240
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
visible because not everybody wants to

241
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,399
be on the live stream

242
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
okay

243
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,440
well this looks good some interesting um

244
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,600
interesting outcomes okay

245
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
so i think i'm going to start going

246
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
through

247
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,440
um

248
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,920
some of the the the

249
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,199
the items these are are definitely very

250
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,160
common um contentious things in fact all

251
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,480
of them are pretty common uh contentious

252
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,399
things that either people get wrong or

253
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,519
scrum people get wrong about kanban or

254
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
camp and people get wrong about scrum or

255
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,600
both

256
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,560
right

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,639
um so

258
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,800
we've got our number one

259
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,800
um is a kanban

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,600
statement work is done

261
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,959
uh within prescribed time boxes there is

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
only one

263
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,760
tick on there i'm gonna put a nice big

264
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,160
cross

265
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,440
in the corner um there's no time boxes

266
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,839
in kanban it's just a continuous flow of

267
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
delivery and a piece of work can take

268
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,800
any amount of time it could take six

269
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
years

270
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,079
right i would suggest that's not a good

271
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,880
idea okay it's something to worry about

272
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
but

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
uh um there's nothing in kanban that

274
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
says

275
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,959
what that what that limit is

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
uh number two this one's pretty

277
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,959
contentious don't you think gordon

278
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,680
every item in the sprint backlog

279
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,519
must help the developers achieve the

280
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,519
sprint goal

281
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,240
i don't know if that's quite i think

282
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,320
it's about 50 50 isn't it

283
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,959
looks about 50 50. what what did what

284
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
did you say for that garden

285
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,720
i said no

286
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
you said no

287
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,480
you are

288
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,000
yeah i mean my thinking is sometimes

289
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,399
there's just stuff that needs to be done

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,600
you are you are correct it would be

291
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,240
totally uh uh ridiculous to say

292
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,320
um you can only put stuff in the in the

293
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,759
sprint that's to do with the sprint goal

294
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
and then

295
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
what about that bug that we just found

296
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,040
in the product that's nothing to do with

297
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,639
what we're working on now does that mean

298
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
we have to ignore that

299
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,880
does that mean we should have a bug

300
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,920
fixing sprint at some point in the

301
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,800
future

302
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,600
right maybe a hardening sprint

303
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,880
right all of those things as results of

304
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
incorrect behavior okay um it's okay to

305
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
have a

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
limited

307
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,560
focus

308
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,399
on the on the sprint goal it's okay

309
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,920
right i would be worried if it was

310
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,600
really low but it's okay it's okay you

311
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,800
can have that you can bring in other

312
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
stuff

313
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
i think this will come out in number six

314
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,120
as well

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,480
uh number three kanban question every

316
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,519
column

317
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,079
must have a whip limit on the board

318
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,480
there is no requirement for every column

319
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
to have a whiplap

320
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
okay

321
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
um it's a common uh misconception it's

322
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,759
one that i got wrong

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,680
uh when i was uh doing my uh profession

324
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,230
professional kanban

325
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,800
certification

326
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,320
[Music]

327
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,120
is now joining somebody joined on the

328
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
phone

329
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,400
that is gonna be awkward because if

330
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,959
you're on the phone you are not going to

331
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,679
be able to see the mural but hopefully

332
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,959
uh um you've got a computer and you can

333
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,240
see it there

334
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,679
um

335
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679
yeah so every column doesn't have to

336
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,079
have a whip limit there just has to be a

337
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,919
whip between the start and finish time

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,439
that's where we calculate our whip you

339
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,120
could have many columns in the middle

340
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,839
that don't have whip limits but the

341
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,760
entire whip limit applies

342
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
um so maybe that's a little bit semantic

343
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,720
i guess

344
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,440
but it's definitely a big x number four

345
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,840
a scrum and cam man one the scrum values

346
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,039
are mandatory and scrum i love that that

347
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,120
is not ambiguous uh everybody put a

348
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,520
lovely green tick in there they are

349
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,400
mandatory you don't have to be awesome

350
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,799
at them that part's not mandatory uh but

351
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,080
you need to to um have a little bit of

352
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,320
focus on them

353
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,200
uh number five kanban

354
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,120
work must flow from left to right on

355
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,000
your kanban board

356
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,679
well

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,520
this was another one that i got wrong

358
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,120
and i argued with daniel for canty we

359
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,919
are all wrong

360
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,200
in that one it doesn't have to

361
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,440
so there's nothing in kanban that says

362
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,480
that your work has to flow from left to

363
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,400
right i would suggest it's a good idea

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
and i would suggest that if it's flowing

365
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,880
the other way you would want to look at

366
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
why it's flowing the other way

367
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,320
but there's nothing in the camera and

368
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
guide that says that it can't

369
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
okay

370
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
um

371
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
i i i agree with them

372
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,240
everybody

373
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
that is a good idea that it flows from

374
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,559
left to right that that i do agree with

375
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,760
but it's not mandatory

376
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,120
uh five six number six oh scrum and

377
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,000
camera one developers can reserve 80 of

378
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,400
their capacity for unplanned work what

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
did you put their garden

380
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,039
i said that was true i said that it was

381
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,320
true but again like for me it feels like

382
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
one of those things like depending on

383
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,280
what's happening that sprint

384
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,120
if you've potentially just gone live

385
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,480
with something you could be expecting a

386
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,320
lot of times you'd be expecting a lot of

387
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,919
unplanned stuff in the next

388
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,080
oh well hopefully you you have better

389
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,960
quality than that garden yeah

390
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,440
yeah hopefully but i mean it's okay to

391
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
reserve uh um 80

392
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
90

393
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
95

394
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
and only spend five percent of your time

395
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,679
on

396
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,520
uh uh

397
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,919
the the sprint goal that goes to that

398
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,919
same number two uh question it's the

399
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,720
other side of that we can reserve time

400
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,240
for other things right you already when

401
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
you walk into sprint planning you're

402
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
thinking about uh any business as usual

403
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
work that you have you're thinking about

404
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,760
any refactoring you might have to do

405
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,080
you're thinking about any production you

406
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,240
know your normal production issues uh

407
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,240
that you you know you reserve 10 year

408
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,160
time for production issues right so

409
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,360
we're already doing it

410
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,640
we just

411
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,120
need to formalize it and say it's okay

412
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,120
to reserve 80 of your capacity now as a

413
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,120
scrum master right i'm going to be

414
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,679
looking at that and going really we're

415
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,280
only able to spend 20 on adding value

416
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,360
for the product owner

417
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,919
maybe we should look at why that's so

418
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,799
low okay but there might be perfectly

419
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,679
reasonable reasons for it i didn't say

420
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,000
good ones i just said reasonable ones

421
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,120
ah that's number six number seven

422
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,320
uh kanban question a definition of done

423
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,360
is a policy on your definition of

424
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,799
workflow yes it is a policy it's just a

425
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,520
policy in kanban so um everything

426
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,440
is defined as a as you as a team

427
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,440
deciding a policy we're gonna we'll get

428
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,799
to that in a little bit um but that

429
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,760
should uh focus there uh number eight

430
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,240
uh scrum and kanban you can start a

431
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
five-day piece of work one day before

432
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,600
the end of the sprint

433
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
this is true i'm just going to grab

434
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,400
somebody's tech and make it bigger it's

435
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,200
easier for me

436
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,320
uh there we go it's true it's okay right

437
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,280
in the kanban world um we can have work

438
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,840
flow across the sprint boundary right um

439
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,520
and if we have awesome engineering

440
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,760
practices gordon knows all about this

441
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,840
he's a microsoft mvp as well if your

442
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,240
engineering practices are good enough

443
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,000
and that you can do continuous delivery

444
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,799
to production

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,520
okay and you can hide work

446
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,080
that is not finished and not show it to

447
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,400
the sprint review not to have it in your

448
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,159
already deployed product because it's

449
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,120
hidden behind a flag

450
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,120
then

451
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,200
there is no reason why

452
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,880
you can't start a five-day piece of work

453
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
one day before the end of the sprint and

454
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,039
you just don't show the sprint review it

455
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,400
doesn't appear in production but we've

456
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,919
we've written some code we've done some

457
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,360
work against it

458
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,080
okay that's perfectly okay in the in the

459
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,200
scrum world as long as our engineering

460
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,840
practices are good enough

461
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
that we can get a usable

462
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,159
increment of work at the end of the

463
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,919
sprint

464
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
right that's the key

465
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,480
i would say that many teams can't do

466
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
that so they're not ready yet to to

467
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,200
to focus on that

468
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,240
uh number nine people participating in a

469
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,799
kanban strategy are referred to oh a

470
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,039
spell mistake as the kanban system

471
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,520
members yup i don't know how many people

472
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
just knew that not many people answered

473
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
it so maybe it was a little bit

474
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,640
confusing wording and we call people

475
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
developers

476
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
in scrum or team members

477
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,840
right that's that's generally the

478
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,760
terminology we use the scrum guide says

479
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,720
developers and the scrum team

480
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
but

481
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,280
in kanban it's just kanban system

482
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
members people participating in the

483
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,400
kanban system

484
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,200
and that doesn't have to be scrum either

485
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,280
it can be waterfall teams

486
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,679
and then the last one number 10 you

487
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,320
don't need a sprint goal for every

488
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,679
sprint and everybody put a big x on it

489
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,440
that's awesome

490
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,440
i am quite happy

491
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,400
with uh that one you don't need to argue

492
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
that

493
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,240
and anything surprising for you there

494
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,240
gordon

495
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,799
yeah the the lifts are off

496
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,919
um like i felt like if any way that's

497
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,360
going to be mandatory it would be in

498
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,840
camera

499
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,039
i know i just me too i thought that as

500
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,679
well and

501
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,559
um i went i went round and round with

502
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,320
with daniel vicanti on it and and he

503
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,880
said as well it it is definitely

504
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,559
a thing you would expect

505
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,919
with positive behavior

506
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
i'm trying i'm trying to not be too

507
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,840
explicit here right yeah um you would

508
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,840
def i i would definitely like to see the

509
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,799
work moving from left to right

510
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,640
right it's going to break your data it's

511
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,799
going to break your ability to monitor

512
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,440
your flow if stuff starts flowing in

513
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,919
multiple directions and things moving

514
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,200
back that's what's going to happen

515
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
um

516
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
but

517
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,039
there's nothing that says it can't

518
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,159
camera it's not just about the data i

519
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
mean it is but it's not

520
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,480
so

521
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,480
um

522
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,720
would any anybody else have a

523
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,760
comment they would like to make on

524
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,400
maybe something they thought was

525
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,400
contentious

526
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,640
athena

527
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,240
i heard a cockerel in the background on

528
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,240
your audio there that's pretty awesome

529
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,360
martin i have a question on

530
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,080
um

531
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,480
the definition of this isn't it

532
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,000
i yes i guess like i recognize the voice

533
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,960
and jumunya

534
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,960
right um i was the only one that put an

535
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,520
x on the

536
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,039
on the definition of done on the

537
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,960
workflow

538
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,200
and the reason why

539
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,679
i put an x was

540
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,520
if a team is not using a scrub

541
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,559
then the definition of them doesn't

542
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,559
apply so maybe you can comment on that

543
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,279
well that that's that's that's

544
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,039
definitely uh uh

545
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,480
i understand

546
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,279
what you're saying

547
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,640
and there would be no requirement for a

548
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,039
kanban team to have a definition of done

549
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,039
okay

550
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,840
but

551
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,320
how do they

552
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,760
know when their work is finished

553
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,840
how do they know

554
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,799
to move that work

555
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,279
from

556
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,080
being in progress

557
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,960
to being completed

558
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,440
what what rule do they apply what

559
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,640
decisions do they make as a team

560
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
in order

561
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,600
for that to happen

562
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,279
and where do they define that

563
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,360
and wouldn't that

564
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,679
definition

565
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,320
in the scrum world we would just call it

566
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,679
a definition of done in the kanban world

567
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,600
it's

568
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,679
a

569
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,279
policy for

570
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,840
being finished

571
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,960
being

572
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,159
complete yeah they probably probably

573
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,919
i was going to say they probably

574
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,480
wouldn't use the terminology definition

575
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
of done but i think the terminology

576
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
definition have done is kind of

577
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,159
ubiquitous at this point

578
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,720
um most people would just use that

579
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,360
terminology our definition of done to

580
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,799
move into that final column or if it's

581
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,200
called completed they might call it

582
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,559
definition of complete eat um but it has

583
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
the same meaning

584
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,360
okay you're right

585
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
you're right

586
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,440
um

587
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,720
yeah that's a little bit maybe maybe

588
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,240
that should have been on a scrum with

589
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,760
kanban uh a card instead of just a

590
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,760
kanban one um

591
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
must be a way to phrase that that

592
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,960
doesn't um

593
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,400
imply

594
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,159
scrum

595
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
i'll think about that i'll think about

596
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,520
that for next time but yeah thank you

597
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,159
for that

598
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,520
so i want to do a little um

599
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,360
exercise i'm going to

600
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
at this point we're going to have to

601
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,279
close the

602
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,440
meeting so let me lock the meeting there

603
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,559
we go

604
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,520
so

605
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,720
oh i clicked it

606
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,159
oh there we go

607
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,520
it didn't disappear right away there we

608
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,679
go logs no one else can join okay

609
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:20,000
uh so i have space for eight groups of

610
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,240
five how many people do we have 31

611
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,159
uh but one person's on the call

612
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,480
so maybe they need to stay with me um

613
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,200
if the person that's on the call are you

614
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,200
able to see the mural

615
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,240
i don't even know how calling in works

616
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
for going off mute

617
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,039
tomorrow

618
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,000
okay so if if you can't

619
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,080
see the mural um it's going to be very

620
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
difficult to participate with everybody

621
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,530
else but

622
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,640
um

623
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,159
[Music]

624
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,360
let's

625
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,840
see

626
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
yeah nobody joined after i put the last

627
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,600
uh copy of the mural in there and so if

628
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,640
you can't see the mural um let me know

629
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,520
in the chat or however you can and i

630
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,120
will not put you in a breakout room uh

631
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,799
because that will put everybody else at

632
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,279
a bit of a disadvantage

633
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,279
thank that

634
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,360
yeah so raise your hand if you cannot

635
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,880
um

636
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,320
access the the the the mural because we

637
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,960
do really need that for this exercise

638
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,279
uh so i'm going to

639
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,480
30 people into five

640
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
gordon you're the smart one

641
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,559
it's six people six in the room man

642
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
right right

643
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,520
if you're doing

644
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
well

645
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,520
let's

646
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,200
do i'm thinking

647
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,120
um

648
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,279
if you wanted your eight to do four

649
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,799
people in there you really want eight

650
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,640
rooms i really want five people

651
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,760
in a room

652
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
um

653
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,840
so

654
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,080
yeah but i'm just worried about so six

655
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,279
rooms let's do five rooms

656
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,799
and then the spare people

657
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,320
just in case

658
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,720
there's somebody who can't access the

659
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,120
mural in a room that'll help us caveat

660
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,399
that problem

661
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,279
so i'm creating

662
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,480
five rooms they'll be numbered one two

663
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,480
five

664
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,000
i have eight boxes here but we'll just

665
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,120
use the first five um so let me summon

666
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,799
everybody

667
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,480
oh

668
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:37,279
i clicked on the wrong thing because

669
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,799
there we go so it's 26 people yeah we

670
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,799
should have

671
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,919
we should have enough okay

672
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,760
so

673
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,640
this is going to be fun gordon does this

674
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,320
look complicated to you

675
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,559
a little yeah oh yeah okay

676
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,720
a lot more boxes than last time so let

677
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,640
me zoom in to one

678
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,399
activity and i'm gonna summon everybody

679
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,480
again so this would be

680
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,840
the the room one

681
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,960
activity

682
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,799
and there are five boxes vertically can

683
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
you see that one two three four five and

684
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,279
round one round two and round three

685
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,080
does that make sense for you gordon yeah

686
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,039
yeah

687
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,080
cool

688
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,120
um so in each round

689
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,039
we are going to do an activity in our

690
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,039
breakout rooms and i'm not going to be

691
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,720
there to help you because there's five

692
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,440
rooms

693
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,200
so

694
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,760
hopefully there's at least one person in

695
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,880
each room that totally understands

696
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,240
everything

697
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,240
um but i have

698
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,559
20

699
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,399
little uh

700
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,120
oh well it would help if they went on

701
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,600
top of the thing bring to front

702
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,679
i have 20 little circles here so i'm

703
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,679
going to copy that paste it in

704
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,760
on top there we go

705
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,720
so i get 20 little circles in the red

706
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,919
box

707
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
okay

708
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,960
and so in your rooms you're going to

709
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,480
decide

710
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,279
who

711
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,279
diana are you okay

712
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,799
yeah android phones don't have right

713
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,880
access to mural if you have an iphone

714
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,080
you do but mural have not been good at

715
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,000
supporting android very well um but yeah

716
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,320
uh uh so

717
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,480
hopefully

718
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,080
your room uh that you can work with um

719
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
the the other people that are there or

720
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,159
you could be the timer

721
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,519
right and so what we're going to do is

722
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,720
we're going to time

723
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,320
how long it takes to do some work

724
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,279
okay that's what we're going to do and

725
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,960
we're going to alter the batch size for

726
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
each round

727
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
okay so the instructions are in the

728
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
mural but i'm going to go through them

729
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,600
because yeah i understand it's it's

730
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,880
complicated so in round one

731
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,720
this is for gordon because he's

732
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
difficult with the complicated stuff so

733
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,760
garden in round one

734
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,679
we're doing batch sizes of 20

735
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,360
right so you you can only move 20 things

736
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,039
at a time

737
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,080
so you have to

738
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,039
whoever's in the red process box

739
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,559
has got to process 20 things move 20

740
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,039
things uh to the green process box

741
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,200
so what i'm going to do for example is

742
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,880
i'm going to change

743
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
each of these

744
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
and i'm

745
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,279
clicking the right trying to click the

746
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,360
right button i'm going to change each of

747
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,440
them to to green

748
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,840
right and then i have to move them over

749
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
to the green box

750
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
oh sorry

751
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,120
i am

752
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,120
not smart am i gordon

753
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,200
let me put that back

754
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
i'm going to change them to red because

755
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,120
they're in the red box gordon you should

756
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,640
have caught me on that

757
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,559
i'm still remember i'm this low and i'm

758
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,720
busy catching up still

759
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,480
yeah so when it's in the red box i've

760
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,559
got to change it to red

761
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,480
and i'm not allowed to move anything

762
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,360
over to the green box until they're all

763
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,880
red because the batch size is 20

764
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,679
right so once they're all red and i'm

765
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,120
going to lay down some rules

766
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,039
you're not allowed to multi-select

767
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,919
gordon

768
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,919
that's what i was thinking

769
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,760
you're not allowed to to

770
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,480
why can't i click i'm having a mural

771
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,480
difficulty here

772
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,440
euro's not letting me deselect the items

773
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,679
um so let me

774
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
refresh my browser because turning it

775
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,799
off and turning it back on again

776
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,760
generally solves every neural problem

777
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,240
there is

778
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,240
i'm just refresher

779
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,919
okay i can see some people are

780
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,159
having a place seeing how you do that

781
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,799
you basically click on an item it pops

782
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,880
up a little uh box you've got a color

783
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,679
button you click it and you change it to

784
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,919
another the red okay

785
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,519
once you've got them all changed to red

786
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,039
right it will look like this wanted

787
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,399
garden well apart from that pink one

788
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,919
that somebody just changed before i

789
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,480
grabbed it

790
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,159
okay and then one at a time you're not

791
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,679
allowed to multi-select you move them

792
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,839
all to green

793
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,480
and then the person who is in the green

794
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,839
process box has to change them to green

795
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,599
but they're not allowed to start

796
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,079
changing them to green until there's 20

797
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,119
items there

798
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,879
so some people will do all 20 items then

799
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
move them across one at a time some

800
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,879
people will change it to

801
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,040
red and move one item across red and

802
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,240
move red and move ready to move but the

803
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,399
green process cannot start

804
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,480
until they are all green

805
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,919
does that make sense

806
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,159
yep

807
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,679
and then they move on to

808
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,919
the yellow process

809
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,599
and whoever in your room is designated

810
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,159
the yellow process

811
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,000
owner is going to make them all yellow

812
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,240
and then pink

813
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,599
and then purple and purple is the

814
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,280
customer

815
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,839
right so once

816
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,839
they're moved into the purple box

817
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,240
we're going to

818
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,320
write down how long it took to get

819
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,880
everything done so somebody in your

820
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,800
group's going to time how long it takes

821
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,280
to get the batch delivered does that

822
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,960
make sense

823
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,440
yeah okay

824
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,800
so the two things

825
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,040
have i made it complicated enough for

826
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,040
you gordon

827
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,760
i think so okay

828
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,680
let's uh what we're gonna do

829
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,599
is i'd like you in your group when you

830
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,200
get into your group is to estimate how

831
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,119
long you think it's going to take right

832
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,160
like how long do i think this is going

833
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,359
to take

834
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,640
and then

835
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,760
you're going to time how long it

836
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,200
actually takes so do go start a timer

837
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
somebody do it on your watch on your

838
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,480
phone whatever it is start a timer and

839
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,119
when the first batch is delivered

840
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,760
split the timer that way you know

841
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,960
it took four minutes to do the whole

842
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,680
batch

843
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,599
when we break up into smaller batches

844
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,720
right because when you move on to round

845
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,359
two

846
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,839
you're gonna do batches of five

847
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,720
so you change five color five to the

848
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,040
color

849
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,720
move it across change five move it

850
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,599
across change five move it across so we

851
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,079
should have three people four people

852
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,640
working at the same time

853
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,560
make sense yeah

854
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,000
and then on the last

855
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,359
round three it's batches of one

856
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,760
right so you can change the color and

857
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,079
move one change the color and move one

858
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,880
so if you're processing in that color

859
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,560
you can process one at a time or five at

860
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,920
a time or twenty at a time that sound

861
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
good

862
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,560
so when so just to make clear so we do

863
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,480
round one we move everything to get it

864
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,240
all the way through down to block five

865
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,839
we capture how long that took do we

866
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,000
immediately move on to round two and

867
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,880
then do it in in batches of five then we

868
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,359
don't

869
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,480
wait for like an external timer or ping

870
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,640
from you

871
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,640
correct we're gonna we're gonna do all

872
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,040
of them and oh

873
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,160
tell you what martin

874
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,160
something weird happened there

875
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,079
i see what happened there

876
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,320
and i see what the problem is this has

877
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,960
become unl why has that

878
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,720
become unlocked

879
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,839
right

880
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:29,680
yes gordon so you do uh i'm gonna put

881
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,880
i'm gonna fill up all of the the little

882
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,839
boxes

883
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,440
okay so you've got your starter

884
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,119
items

885
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,040
can you see that now

886
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,160
yeah i'll i'll do the other teams as

887
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,839
well okay yeah and but the idea is you

888
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,440
click an item change the color so when

889
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,200
you get into your rooms

890
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,160
decide who's going to work at each

891
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,079
station

892
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,079
there's five stations the customer is

893
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,119
the last one

894
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,119
then time how long it takes

895
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,480
to get one batch done

896
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,000
and then the final batch done

897
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,560
so we don't care about all the ones in

898
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,079
between first batch final batch so

899
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,960
obviously in round one there's only one

900
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,400
batch anyway so it's the same number

901
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,720
round two there are four batches

902
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,040
of five and round three there are 20

903
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,839
batches of one

904
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,839
does that make sense

905
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,640
just the

906
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,280
just double check so the on round two we

907
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,480
move five across the two right

908
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,160
so once on round two and you change five

909
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,480
the color of five of them

910
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,240
move five across to green and then the

911
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,599
green person can start working with that

912
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,599
batch of five

913
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,680
but can the red person start working on

914
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,599
the next batch so long yes

915
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,320
okay cool that's the idea that's the

916
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,839
idea is yeah yeah as soon as we start

917
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,920
reducing the batch size we're going to

918
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,960
have multiple people working at the same

919
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,560
time

920
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,400
yeah right and we're the important thing

921
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,480
is to collect

922
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,160
collect the numbers okay so i put um

923
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,839
some little stickies on there so you can

924
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,280
put the numbers in those box and i'll

925
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,160
just add

926
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,920
uh

927
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
some stickies to the

928
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,839
other two

929
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,280
there we

930
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:17,760
go right so it's just taking me a minute

931
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,079
to to set this up and then i'm gonna

932
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,000
copy that whole thing so don't move

933
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,000
anything around yet and we've got

934
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
there's

935
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,960
why is

936
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,359
mural is definitely being a bit weird

937
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,359
today

938
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,160
and your first batch is the

939
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,440
the first time that all of that batch

940
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,760
stars make it into the customer and your

941
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,920
your second sticky is once basically all

942
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,119
20 have made it through to the customer

943
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,599
the timer

944
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,599
correct

945
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,520
so let me have just filled up two of

946
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,200
three of the things let me get the

947
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,359
ah

948
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,880
i almost got that to sit on top of the

949
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,640
thing that i wanted to sit on top of

950
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,640
there we go

951
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,520
so everybody remember

952
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,920
now

953
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,480
these things can move around so i've set

954
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,960
up all five

955
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,880
batches

956
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,119
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna monitor

957
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,960
what's going um and i might jump into a

958
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,920
breakout room if folks are having

959
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,040
trouble

960
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,160
right but cheating

961
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,359
cheating

962
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,680
is uh multi-selecting

963
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,520
right that's cheating in this case so

964
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,760
when you're dragging and moving you can

965
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,640
only move one at a time

966
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,200
you can't start your batch until your

967
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,000
process until the full batch that you're

968
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,319
expecting is there

969
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,400
does that make sense as well gordon

970
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,480
yeah

971
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,800
i don't seem to be in any breakup uh you

972
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,920
are definitely not yet

973
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,200
eki i have not opened the breakout rooms

974
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,119
um

975
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,079
mainly because

976
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,680
uh

977
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,119
gordon was having such a difficult time

978
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,000
understanding so i wanted to make sure

979
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,839
everybody everybody he's my litmus test

980
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,240
he's my litmus test

981
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,560
uh so i'm going to open the rooms i will

982
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,760
come and help but proceed from

983
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,079
round one

984
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
to round two to round three

985
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,079
right

986
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,079
um

987
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:25,119
do them one at a time make sure you you

988
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,599
know which process you are what color

989
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,280
are you changing things to and agree

990
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,680
before you start

991
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,440
how you're going to do the work okay

992
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,839
does that make sense

993
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,359
and i will keep an eye out for cheating

994
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,200
that's what i will do

995
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,760
okay so i'm going to open the breakout

996
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,640
rooms um if you need me ping me the

997
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,359
seven

998
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,440
six six six six in the different rooms

999
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,880
and so maybe somebody's just watching

1000
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,440
but um

1001
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,079
if you're just watching either do the

1002
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,880
timing or um

1003
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:58,800
watch out for cheating that's that's

1004
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,040
lots of vigilant people that's what we

1005
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,040
want

1006
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,640
uh so let me do that

1007
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,839
so breaker rooms have started opening uh

1008
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,800
you should all

1009
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,040
um

1010
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
end up in a breakout room and the number

1011
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,440
of the breakout room matches the

1012
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,880
box at the top of the different areas so

1013
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,880
there are five areas and five breakout

1014
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,880
rooms

1015
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,800
okay so

1016
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,359
oh

1017
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,599
i did that badly

1018
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,520
right so don't show cursors hiding on

1019
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,400
facilitator cursors

1020
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,040
okay

1021
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,160
that should speed things up

1022
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
okay

1023
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,520
so

1024
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,240
james

1025
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,240
are you okay

1026
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,920
i can see you're still here

1027
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,920
james did not end up in a room

1028
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,520
i am having a bit of a

1029
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,079
it sounds like

1030
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,920
um you're having a little bit of

1031
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,880
internet connection issues which room

1032
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,240
did you

1033
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,640
get uh

1034
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,040
let's see we lost

1035
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,040
um

1036
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,800
see we lost a couple of people there's

1037
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
there's your room let me ask you to join

1038
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,200
your room

1039
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:36,359
do you get a pop-up now james

1040
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,200
one two three four five

1041
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,760
so room threes get five

1042
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,640
one two three four five room four is

1043
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,359
good five one two three four five room

1044
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,280
fives get five so we're good there

1045
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:08,720
and one two three four five awesome um

1046
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:12,000
so we lost dennis

1047
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,000
james is being difficult

1048
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,240
yeah

1049
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,560
so um have you seen this exercise before

1050
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,560
james

1051
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,000
is it a variation on the coin game it is

1052
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,359
a variation

1053
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,440
yeah yeah

1054
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,000
so instead when you're doing it in

1055
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,880
person um you can't really

1056
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,560
um

1057
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,560
you can't really do

1058
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,480
do that so we need to to do it a little

1059
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,200
bit differently um i think we're going

1060
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,480
to struggle for for for time actually

1061
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,280
because it took a long time to explain

1062
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,839
that

1063
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,839
um

1064
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,319
is sometimes difficult with so many

1065
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,839
people as well

1066
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,640
yeah it's awesome the way you've set it

1067
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,680
up it looks really good i'm sorry i'm

1068
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,680
just really struggling with

1069
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,319
these things happen internet sometimes

1070
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,400
uh it doesn't work out so well um it

1071
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:19,599
looks like i'm i'm not sure who it is

1072
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,800
that's on the on the call um because it

1073
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,560
doesn't say your name it just says your

1074
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,160
phone number um but plus 23 um must be

1075
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,560
having a bit of trouble as well and

1076
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,920
decided just to call in um and sometimes

1077
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,119
that works too

1078
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,960
right i mean

1079
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,520
um

1080
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,359
luckily once murals mural can take a

1081
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,040
long time to load on a poor connection

1082
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,160
but once it's loaded it usually works

1083
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,119
pretty well

1084
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,839
um

1085
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,960
but actually i've no oh there's one team

1086
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,400
group three has started to move items or

1087
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
they're thinking about it there's there

1088
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,920
may be still

1089
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
i'm actually going to pop if if you can

1090
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,520
forgive me james for leaving you here

1091
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,599
for a minute please do

1092
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,640
i know please do i'm sorry i can't get

1093
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,480
into the room i i'm trying to

1094
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,440
did the calling you again see if that

1095
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,240
works

1096
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,240
um

1097
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,119
but i'm just going to pop into each room

1098
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,800
and

1099
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,800
make sure that folks are okay

1100
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,720
it's heading into room

1101
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,160
okay you can't see

1102
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,160
i can't see

1103
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,720
yeah i think somebody else has the same

1104
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:30,480
problem as you couldn't see the mirror

1105
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,480
hey folks how are things going

1106
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,079
to

1107
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,720
coordinate which one will be which color

1108
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:45,760
no no that's totally good so um

1109
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,880
what might be might be easy is just

1110
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,520
putting a post-it with your name

1111
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,960
on the boards

1112
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,440
do you know how to put a post-it on

1113
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,760
there if you drag one

1114
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,920
uh over from the from the left

1115
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,040
yep we got so make the post it's really

1116
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,760
small

1117
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,839
that's probably a good idea um

1118
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,839
and then that make it easier to pick

1119
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:14,000
who's who's which color

1120
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,000
yeah

1121
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,560
you're very welcome

1122
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,359
so um

1123
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,800
no the the the there is only one batch

1124
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,200
in round one

1125
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,880
of 20 items that goes through the whole

1126
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,960
process

1127
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,839
so you only need to record one number

1128
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,000
for

1129
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:53,000
uh um for round one okay

1130
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,160
that's that's just

1131
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,960
me duplicating

1132
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,960
things at the bottom

1133
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
five minutes you guys think you can do

1134
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,000
it in five minutes

1135
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,839
hey guys can we start

1136
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,680
so who's doing the timer

1137
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,680
one after the other yeah yes

1138
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
perfect

1139
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,520
ah yes

1140
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,160
so uh

1141
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,400
i think uh uh gregory is gonna start the

1142
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,520
timer once you change the first color

1143
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,400
anna

1144
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,839
yeah

1145
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,920
cool okay

1146
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,079
sounds like you you're all sorted i'll

1147
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,640
go check on another group okay

1148
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,640
okay thank you

1149
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,640
ah that's better

1150
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,200
let's see

1151
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,200
group two oh

1152
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,520
there we go

1153
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,280
and there we go

1154
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,839
group two's off to the races as well

1155
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,800
looks like james managed to get in there

1156
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:49,280
i think he's done the the coin game

1157
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,040
uh before uh for those on the on the

1158
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,000
stream who are wondering what the heck's

1159
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,640
going on uh you can see the

1160
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,400
to the site yep opposites

1161
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,079
uh you can see

1162
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,839
uh each group has a a little set tokens

1163
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,760
and they're just changing the color of

1164
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,599
the tokens which simulates flipping a

1165
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,640
coin when you run this

1166
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,280
in person with a group of people um i

1167
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,000
usually turn up with a bag of coins like

1168
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,319
20 coins and um first person gets the

1169
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,720
bag of coins they have to sort them out

1170
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,079
so that they're all either heads up or

1171
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,200
tails up

1172
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,200
um and then each person

1173
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,960
that it goes to in the process flips the

1174
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,200
coins over and they have to flip all of

1175
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,119
the coins over and you you make rules

1176
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,559
like you know one hand behind your back

1177
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,480
or uh you know not flipping two at once

1178
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,319
um

1179
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,040
all those kind of things and then it has

1180
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,240
to go around all the people before um

1181
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,800
it's it's done in in the batch size uh

1182
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,280
so the first exercise is batches of ten

1183
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,319
so you can already see that it's going

1184
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,480
it's going pretty slowly uh for the for

1185
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,319
the for the for the groups i might have

1186
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,680
to pop in and help out group four if

1187
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,119
their stuff doesn't start moving in a

1188
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,359
minute um but you can see uh group ones

1189
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,400
getting uh going from one to two and

1190
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,839
then they're gonna start changing to

1191
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,040
green we have to get them all across

1192
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:13,119
first um and it's it's the time it takes

1193
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,960
to do all of those things builds up and

1194
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,280
builds up and builds up

1195
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,960
um and when you've only got one person

1196
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
working at once

1197
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,280
on a particular

1198
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,079
activity it really slows down

1199
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,720
right

1200
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,319
so if you're in the in the in the in the

1201
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,400
software world

1202
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,880
and what that equates to

1203
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,359
is a big backlog item

1204
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,599
right some big chunky thing uh flowing

1205
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,079
through the process that's a big batch

1206
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,240
size that's a batch right um i have

1207
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,680
another exercise that we probably won't

1208
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,160
have time for we'll probably wrap up

1209
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,640
this one and that's all we'll have time

1210
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,319
for uh just because of uh the length of

1211
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,920
time that this uh took to set up um i

1212
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,960
probably need more practice at doing

1213
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,760
that

1214
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,760
um

1215
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,040
but that that this time is going to be

1216
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,119
huge for

1217
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,680
uh round one and then it's going to

1218
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,400
reduce obviously as we get towards round

1219
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,760
three

1220
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,240
but the thing that's surprising is the

1221
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,359
amount that it reduces okay

1222
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,680
um

1223
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,760
so it tends to be a

1224
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,319
a huge amount of time

1225
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,599
i think 20 items is too much i need to

1226
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,119
reduce that to 15. um

1227
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,599
thank you claudia

1228
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,000
gladia um

1229
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,880
i had it at 50 50

1230
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,839
15 15 and i changed it to 20. 15 is the

1231
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,319
right number

1232
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,480
um oh i see a big multi-select going on

1233
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,720
in room four i'm going to let them away

1234
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,480
with it because they're quite far behind

1235
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,440
so they are uh

1236
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,440
cheating a little bit

1237
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,839
that's okay

1238
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,760
um

1239
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,720
so let's see what we've got

1240
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,520
uh

1241
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,359
yep room one is on

1242
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:00,559
two to three

1243
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,040
room two is on two to three room three

1244
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,280
is on three to four

1245
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,160
room four is on two to three well

1246
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,559
they're on two the processing two

1247
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,400
um room five is almost finished

1248
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,559
processing too

1249
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,800
that's that's that's okay the numbers

1250
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,559
are going to be really horrible and

1251
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,400
that's what you want from this exercise

1252
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,440
you want to demonstrate that the numbers

1253
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,000
are horrible when you have big batches i

1254
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,880
use this exercise quite a lot with teams

1255
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,280
uh when they uh are are

1256
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,040
don't see the value of breaking things

1257
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,119
down into smaller items this can be a

1258
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,960
good exercise to kind of just trigger

1259
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,359
them thinking about well

1260
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,240
what does having a big thing mean how

1261
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,200
important is it to break things down

1262
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,559
because there's extra management effort

1263
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,720
in at working with uh smaller things

1264
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,559
right um if you think about you've got

1265
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,960
your your tickets in jira or as your

1266
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,880
devops or whatever it is you're using um

1267
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,200
i have one ticket to manage versus i

1268
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,760
have 20 tickets to manage which one's

1269
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,520
easier to manage from a from a tooling

1270
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,720
perspective well the one ticket's easier

1271
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,839
to manage

1272
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,079
but from a work being done perspective

1273
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:10,880
it's better to have those smaller units

1274
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,599
so

1275
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,280
the

1276
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,119
balance of work

1277
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,920
between the amount of time you spend

1278
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,480
doing the work versus managing the work

1279
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,680
is where that contention comes in and i

1280
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,440
do find

1281
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,720
that a lot of teams

1282
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:29,920
begrudge the extra i don't know

1283
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:33,839
30 minutes the extra hour even it takes

1284
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,880
to manage those 20 items versus the the

1285
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:38,319
the one big item um but the benefit of

1286
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,680
breaking them down into smaller things

1287
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:43,280
is huge

1288
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,040
it can really help teams improve their

1289
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
flow of delivery improve their

1290
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:53,119
predictability um and just get better at

1291
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:55,599
delivering stuff um so we've got

1292
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:58,400
yeah this this uh

1293
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,040
is definitely taking uh quite a while we

1294
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,280
are gonna hit the time limit i'm gonna

1295
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,960
carry on because um

1296
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,960
that's what i

1297
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,559
do but i think we took a little bit too

1298
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,359
long in the icebreaker and then it just

1299
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:14,960
took too long to explain it

1300
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,599
i'm trying to think of ways to do this

1301
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,359
um exercise that make it easier for

1302
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,559
people to understand so we can get into

1303
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,799
it quicker

1304
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,680
because it should take about 30 minutes

1305
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:29,440
all told um probably about eight minutes

1306
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,040
for the first uh round and then reducing

1307
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,960
there i think i put ten minutes for the

1308
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,040
first round five minutes for the second

1309
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,240
round three minutes for the third round

1310
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,799
because people do get better at doing

1311
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,799
the task right uh there's a little bit

1312
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,880
of learned uh

1313
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,799
repetitive movement you're learning

1314
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,400
better ways to do it so that improves

1315
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,920
but only a little bit

1316
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,079
right the biggest improvement comes from

1317
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,359
batch size uh so we get three to four

1318
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,319
three to four

1319
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,440
okay

1320
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,599
awesome

1321
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,599
so we've got one group

1322
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,680
that is finished and took

1323
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,440
eight minutes 32

1324
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,559
but their expectation was about four

1325
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,680
minutes

1326
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,960
so that's that's pretty pretty uh

1327
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,640
pretty awesome time so they're on their

1328
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,559
second round and it's batches of five so

1329
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,799
hopefully um

1330
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,799
they

1331
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,119
will get that organized

1332
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,400
i am going to

1333
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,760
let me

1334
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,839
i'm gonna

1335
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,119
delete

1336
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,000
that i think

1337
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,160
um

1338
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,760
sometimes mural doesn't like having too

1339
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,240
many things

1340
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,760
on the board so if i delete these even

1341
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,680
though i've made them one thing by

1342
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,880
grouping them i wonder if grouping

1343
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,040
really helps from a

1344
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,359
a performance perspective

1345
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,680
it should do it should do

1346
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,680
um

1347
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,599
which group is gardening

1348
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,599
james is in group two

1349
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,760
gordon is in group three how's group

1350
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,280
three doing okay so group three started

1351
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,240
on there

1352
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,240
second round

1353
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,520
ah so they're thinking six minutes for

1354
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:17,760
the second round okay

1355
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,760
so that could be interesting

1356
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:23,119
so that's their first group of five

1357
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,400
and then the next person so they've

1358
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,640
they've got a little bit of a bottleneck

1359
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,319
there you can see that how they've

1360
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,160
organized the stuff they would need to

1361
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,760
learn

1362
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,520
the first batch is here the second

1363
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,220
incoming batch is here that way they

1364
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,260
don't get them mixed up

1365
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,260
[Music]

1366
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,880
but they'll learn that as they go

1367
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,400
through because they're they've got to

1368
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,400
do it four times so they get four

1369
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,839
chances to optimize

1370
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,839
their process as they go through

1371
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:59,920
it's definitely uh interesting i love

1372
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,920
doing the exercises uh this one

1373
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,920
is just a little bit uh time-consuming

1374
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,920
but i'm gonna pop in and

1375
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,119
because i think

1376
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,359
group five there is struggling a little

1377
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,359
bit

1378
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:23,559
oh and so is group two

1379
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:23,559
group two and group five are struggling

1380
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:35,880
oh okay group four is um

1381
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,880
let me go help group four

1382
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,359
give me some assistance here or martin

1383
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,960
khan

1384
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,640
okay

1385
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,480
martin i'm trying to select about these

1386
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,839
so that i move them

1387
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,480
yes so

1388
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,960
i was using

1389
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,880
yeah so so you're only supposed to

1390
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,720
select one at a time

1391
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,240
but

1392
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,720
right can you drag them and move them

1393
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,720
just now

1394
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,200
there you go yes so how how how we are

1395
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:15,040
doing it is once you change all of them

1396
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,319
you take all of them at once then you

1397
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,480
start changing them then you start

1398
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:21,520
recording time then okay

1399
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,440
so does that work it does it does you

1400
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,319
you do it do it that way that makes

1401
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,559
sense um

1402
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,920
remember that we want just the the time

1403
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,240
for the first

1404
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,880
batch all the way through the system so

1405
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,160
it goes one two three four five how long

1406
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,760
does it take to get everything through

1407
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,599
the system

1408
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,839
okay no problem yeah that's that's the

1409
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:45,119
time that we're looking for

1410
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:47,920
okay okay it's your turn change them to

1411
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,160
which colors is orange or yellow

1412
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,920
yes one of those colors duplicates i'm

1413
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,240
moving to that next box the way that

1414
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,520
that is for you if you can move them to

1415
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,040
the next box

1416
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,599
now i've already moved them it's for you

1417
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,599
to change to yellow yes right so i'm

1418
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:04,799
changing yellow

1419
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,799
this is my screen

1420
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,680
i think i think you lost somebody um

1421
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,559
would you like me to take yellow and

1422
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,440
then you take pink ecky yes this boy

1423
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,799
so

1424
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,280
yellow so let's do yellow

1425
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:25,680
yellow

1426
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,680
yellow

1427
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,079
it's very hard isn't it

1428
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,480
it's tiring

1429
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,160
it is repetitive strain injuries coming

1430
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,079
on here

1431
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,520
develop developing a repetitive strain

1432
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,160
injury

1433
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,400
oh oh oh click the wrong nope stop

spinning it right i'll go over here

1435
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,359
sometimes when they're too close

1436
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,200
together

1437
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,359
you end up

1438
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,200
with a tool dysfunction and it's trying

1439
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,200
to spin the items rather than

1440
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,079
uh

1441
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,040

1447
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,799
three minutes 49 seconds 50 seconds 51.

1448
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,520
so in our in this group we're selecting

1449
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:25,599
them all at once yeah

1450
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,200
yes right

1451
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,440

1472
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:44,240
so so whoever's whoever's uh red should

1499
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,480
once again uh so if you just hold down

1500
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,480

01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,280
they'll go

1503
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,119
what's the time on the timer now the

1504
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,039
total time

1505
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,760
six minutes

1506
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,119
eight seconds it's never six minutes six

1507
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,119
seconds

1508
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,480
i'm gonna put that down though six

1509
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,280
minutes

1510
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,280
six seconds

1511
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,880
but that's for

1512
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,559
that's not for the first batch

1513
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,319
so what do you mean by the first batch i

1514
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,720
don't

1515
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:41,520
all of them

1516
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:45,440
how long did it take you to get

1517
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,920
them from one all the way down to five

1518
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,119
so we haven't finished five years so as

1519
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,359
it is

1520
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,319
the the first batch we did it at one

1521
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,880
minute 28 seconds okay so

1522
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,720
the customer one which is now i guess

1523
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,119
we're supposed to change them to purple

1524
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,960
what let's what i want let's call let's

1525
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,280
call the customer one done

1526
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,480
okay then so it's six minutes six

1527
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,160
seconds

1528
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,079
in total one two three four okay yeah

1529
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,240
six minutes it seems like you were

1530
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:16,720
stopping the timer but um we'll we'll

1531
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,200
let it go okay so

1532
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,319
for round two i'd like you to start

1533
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,680
round two

1534
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,400
um

1535
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,799
change five of them move five to the

1536
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:30,480
next process and then start changing the

1537
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:30,480
next five does that make sense

1538
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,799
so there should be

1539
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,960
so

1540
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:38,880
five turn to red

1541
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,960
give them to green

1542
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,200
next five turn to red give them to green

1543
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,119
next five turn to red give them to green

1544
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,839
green works on the first five they get

1545
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,680
from red moves them to yellow

1546
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:52,319
they should have the next five from red

1547
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:54,400
waiting move them to yellow

1548
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,920
make sense

1549
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,680
okay then

1550
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,599
so if if that's the case that means they

1551
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,440
shouldn't stop the timer so start the

1552
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,440
timer again from scratch

1553
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,640
okay

1554
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,400
so if you if you hit the reset okay

1555
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,799
so um

1556
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,319
let i'll be i'll be red

1557
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:15,839
okay

1558
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:19,119
and who's who's green

1559
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,119
who's who's the green color

1560
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,680
is that you dennis dennis are you green

1561
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,160
okay

1562
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:28,319
so i'm gonna i'm gonna change

1563
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,000
so start the timer

1564
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,920
oh

1565
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,039
start your timer

1566
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,760
started

1567
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:39,280
started it cool uh so i'm gonna change

1568
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:41,280
five of these one

1569
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,200
two

1570
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,520
oh

1571
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,520
three

1572
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,920
four

1573
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,880
five to red

1574
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:54,799
and then i'm gonna put them one

1575
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,319
two

1576
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:58,559
three

1577
01:07:56,319 --> 01:08:00,559
four

1578
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,480
five whoever's green can start changing

1579
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,880
those ones to green while i work on the

1580
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,880
next five

1581
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,880
okay

1582
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,880
one

1583
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,880
two

1584
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,560
three

1585
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,960
four

1586
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,960
five

1587
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,600
okay so whoever's in the yellow process

1588
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,640
once you've got five you can start

1589
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,640
working on the five

1590
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,799
so there'll be three of us working at

1591
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,799
the same time

1592
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,839
one

1593
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,080
two

1594
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,920
three

1631
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,840
but the time we had left over we

thank you for that michelle my everybody

1634
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,040
knows my spelling is atrocious

1635
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,800
it's a well-known fact but there's a

1636
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:39,440
number this is the number 15 or 20.

1637
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,040
so i have i let me

1638
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,400
i'm just going to mute everybody because

1639
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,719
of some background noise from a couple

1640
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,719
of people um but feel free to unmute

1641
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:49,840
again if you don't have a background

1642
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,360
noise um so that was uh

1643
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,600
very interesting there was a lot of

1644
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:56,159
things going on there and i see that

1645
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,080
some teams managed to have different

1646
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,320
degrees of how quickly they got through

1647
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,840
it and i'm just looking to see who who

1648
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,920
was the longest

1649
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,840
in room one uh 10 minutes 30 seconds

1650
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,480
for

1651
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,900
five

1652
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,719
uh

1653
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:13,120
[Music]

1654
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,679
nine nine minutes 55 so about 10 seconds

1655
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,880
again for two

1656
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,159
seven

1657
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,159
eight minutes for for room one

1658
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:24,800
i'm just gonna look at room three

1659
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,159
because they managed to to to finish

1660
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,120
all of their items so i'm just going to

1661
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:31,600
summon everybody over um

1662
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,000
to see what we what we got here so i'm

1663
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,040
just going to use this as as indicative

1664
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,199
of

1665
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,199
um roughly how it would have turned out

1666
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:41,120
for everybody okay because everybody's

1667
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,640
kind of doing the same tasks although

1668
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:46,239
some teams were cheating and

1669
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,679
multi-selecting but let's not go there

1670
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,239
martin are you gonna share your screen

1671
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:52,320
by any chance

1672
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:54,159
uh i can share my screen i think a

1673
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,400
couple of you are struggling with

1674
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:59,120
internet so let me share my screen and

1675
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,159
then you can um

1676
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,000
see that

1677
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,800
and let me do that so i can give me a

1678
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,120
second so i can see you guys again

1679
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,719
there we go now

1680
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,040
and see you guys so i'm sharing sharing

1681
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,360
uh my screen here

1682
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,320
uh that's working over there so

1683
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:17,679
um in in round one where we did batches

1684
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,360
of 20

1685
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:22,560
so only one person was working at once

1686
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,360
weren't they

1687
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:28,239
so with one person working at once uh it

1688
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,600
took about nine minutes if we average it

1689
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:32,080
between all of the teams it probably

1690
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,080
took about nine minutes to get 20 things

1691
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,840
done

1692
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,760
what was your guess your guesstimate

1693
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,760
michelle at the start of round one

1694
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,400
four minutes yeah

1695
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,800
so part of the problem there was there

1696
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,880
was a bit of a panic um the estimation

1697
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,320
because we sort of forgot to

1698
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,159
do it and then we got started with the

1699
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,840
first four and there was like a panic ah

1700
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,560
four minutes

1701
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,840
and then we we like got like halfway and

1702
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,600
then it was already like just over four

1703
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,040
when teams are working for real all the

1704
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,120
best decisions are made in a panic

1705
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,120
currently

1706
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,239
i mean yeah and

1707
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,960
you can see that we got better with

1708
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:13,600
estimations as each uh sprint completed

1709
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,239
there yep as each round as you finished

1710
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:19,440
each round you definitely got got better

1711
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:21,280
you got closer in so um round one four

1712
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,120
minute guess eight and a half minute

1713
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,640
finish eight and a half

1714
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,199
actually pretty fast

1715
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,760
for this exercise with 20 items

1716
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:31,440
round two six minute guess

1717
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,440
four minute finish

1718
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:35,760
but how quickly did you get the first

1719
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,960
batch of five

1720
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,480
two minutes

1721
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,560
as half

1722
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,960
half the the time

1723
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:44,800
that you took to get all of them

1724
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,239
and that time to get all of them in

1725
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,880
batches of five

1726
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:52,640
was twice as fast as the time it took

1727
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,640
you to do a batch of 20. why was that

1728
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,520
because there

1729
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,520
was people working

1730
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,480
it was more efficient

1731
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:06,960
the the more efficient because you get

1732
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,320
more people working at once

1733
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,520
yeah

1734
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,440
and then what happens when we go to back

1735
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,199
but also there must be a little part

1736
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,719
there must be a small part of they've

1737
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,800
already done it once so they got better

1738
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:20,159
at the job as well yes

1739
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,880
so so there is a there is a uh uh

1740
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:25,360
if you run the whole exercise again

1741
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,440
right that's you've got the skills now a

1742
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,679
little bit extra skills to do the job

1743
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,920
you find that the timing doesn't change

1744
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,600
that much but it does change it does get

1745
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,440
a little bit better

1746
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,640
right a little bit better

1747
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:41,040
but the vast majority of this time

1748
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,360
savings that we got

1749
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:44,719
was in the team being more effective as

1750
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,640
a whole

1751
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,480
right and working more people working at

1752
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,239
once and then you can see how long it

1753
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,840
takes you to get one piece of the first

1754
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:57,600
piece of value in round three

1755
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,600
28 seconds yeah

1756
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:03,360
that's that's a quarter of the time it

1757
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,360
took you from round two

1758
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:11,440
so the value's not the value's not huge

1759
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,440
number three right but if that's now

1760
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,000
if that was your first experiment

1761
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,800
you would find out in 30 seconds that

1762
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:23,360
the rest of it's not worth it if you

1763
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,560
only if you had to stop after the first

1764
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,080
piece of work

1765
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,400
which piece of work should you have done

1766
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,400
first

1767
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,159
did anybody notice that the pieces of

1768
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,080
work had different numbers on them

1769
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,400
yeah yeah

1770
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,239
we got some of ours in the wrong order

1771
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,480
on the second one second thing it was

1772
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:47,120
that it was that's so it was kind of for

1773
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,199
that but kinda to ask the question

1774
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,640
wouldn't it be best to do the tens first

1775
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:54,239
if 10

1776
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:56,640
represented the amount of value

1777
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:58,080
right you would do the tens first so i

1778
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,600
mean

1779
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,280
well in my mind

1780
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,800
the size or at least when i saw the

1781
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,320
numbers i was thinking of the sort of

1782
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,080
amount of effort required in getting

1783
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,280
that piece of work done

1784
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:09,520
which is why you would want to start

1785
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,840
with but they are all the same

1786
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,480
yeah fair enough yeah

1787
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,199
so the the if if it's value

1788
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,360
if you did the tens and then the fives

1789
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:22,880
and then had to stop

1790
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:24,000
and there's only the ones left

1791
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,239
you've got

1792
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,840
90 of the value through the system

1793
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:32,000
already yeah

1794
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:34,000
yeah the other small side effect that i

1795
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,440
noticed was was

1796
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,040
the the

1797
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:39,120
i suppose you could say the quality of

1798
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,239
it so if you look at the first block

1799
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,199
first block um when we're doing twenty

1800
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,679
like

1801
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,440
i was in in block four there the rushing

1802
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,920
of dropping it on they sort of all just

1803
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,280
landed in twenty twenty um

1804
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,679
the second block you can see some of

1805
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,120
them overlapping but not that many

1806
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,800
and in the fifth block i think there's

1807
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:59,679
one block that's touching each other so

1808
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:03,360
the overall quality of the job with a

1809
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:05,679
more streamlined workflow um

1810
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,600
was better as well as well i i agree

1811
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,239
gordon and there's also that that piece

1812
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:13,280
where if you're looking at a pile of 20

1813
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:15,280
things you're going holy molly i've got

1814
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,760
20 things i've got to do when there's

1815
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,239
only one thing i'm just doing one thing

1816
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,960
one thing you know you you do it you do

1817
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,640
that one thing right that one thing

1818
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,480
right but if i've got to do 20 things

1819
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,239
i'm starting to rush i'm starting to

1820
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:32,719
make mistakes i change it to the wrong

1821
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:36,159
color i set a a border rather than a

1822
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:38,159
color but you know accidentally um or i

1823
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:39,760
i moved to trying to drag and drop too

1824
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:42,080
many things that were too close together

1825
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,199
and you end up spinning one in a circle

1826
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,600
um

1827
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,840
you know so that's two issues

1828
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,760
right but that represents the real world

1829
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,880
yeah and when i do this with physical

1830
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:55,760
coins the coins fall off the table

1831
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,199
right somebody has ham fists the coins

1832
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,719
so they fall off the table the timer

1833
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,080
doesn't stop because the customer still

1834
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,360
wants the value

1835
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,360
yeah and we've got to go pick it up that

1836
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,800
simulates a bug that simulates something

1837
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,920
getting in the way of our process and

1838
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,520
our problem

1839
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,480
yeah it's something that we spoke about

1840
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,840
i was like

1841
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,159
with my ocd

1842
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,920
like i would if i chose the wrong shade

1843
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:15,840
of pink even though it's pink i'd have

1844
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,199
to go back and do it again michelle is

1845
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,320
like well i'm the customer i'm not going

1846
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:23,679
to accept different shades of pink

1847
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,920
yeah so so there's also a quality check

1848
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,920
at each stage

1849
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,920
that you could do as well

1850
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,719
right make sure it moved to the right

1851
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,400
right

1852
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,080
the right process happened i mean we're

1853
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,040
just changing colors which is a little

1854
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,560
bit

1855
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,640
straightforward

1856
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,640
right but when we're building software

1857
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,400
or we're building products things moving

1858
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,600
between the stages it's a little more

1859
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,159
complicated

1860
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,719
yeah so we can see

1861
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:50,320
visualize using this exercise this is a

1862
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:51,120
good exercise to run with your teams as

1863
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,600
well

1864
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,080
we can visualize why smaller batches go

1865
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,920
through the system faster

1866
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,000
right it helps us make that connection

1867
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,960
in our head quite often i work with

1868
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,960
teams

1869
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,840
and they don't want to spend the extra

1870
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,080
effort to break things down into smaller

1871
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,760
chunks

1872
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,600
right because then we have to manage it

1873
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,639
in jira or we have to manage it in azure

1874
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,080
devops

1875
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:18,320
yeah yeah that's more overhead

1876
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,600
but that overhead is tiny in comparison

1877
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,000
to the amount of time you save because

1878
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,199
you've got smaller batches

1879
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,679
can can you think of what might

1880
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,440
make this more difficult to have smaller

1881
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,840
batches

1882
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:34,320
so i was

1883
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:36,159
saying um if we had to set a whip limit

1884
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,239
um so you can't move

1885
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:40,400
stuff into one block if there's already

1886
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,480
like say the limits three three because

1887
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,840
then that would cause a build up in the

1888
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,360
box going backwards

1889
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,120
yep you could introduce a whip limit

1890
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,280
that's definitely a good experiment to

1891
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:55,360
try and see you know if we if if you

1892
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,880
our our batch size when our batch size

1893
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,120
is one

1894
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,639
right in this scenario we got the most

1895
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,120
effective

1896
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,239
delivery

1897
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,520
right

1898
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,719
what would happen

1899
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:11,760
if we were using physical coins

1900
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:12,840
flipping them over and each station was

1901
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,760
in a different

1902
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:18,000
room with a batch size of one still be

1903
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,440
optimal perhaps not because you waste a

1904
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,679
bunch of time running between the rooms

1905
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,840
so maybe batches of five might be better

1906
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,600
or maybe batches of ten would be better

1907
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,920
if we have to run between the rooms yeah

1908
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,719
i suppose the distance between rooms

1909
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,719
would would would have to be a

1910
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,239
factor there in fact i mean if the if

1911
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,440
the rooms are like 100

1912
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:37,920
parts

1913
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,440
batches of 20 because 20 because or even

1914
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,639
batches of 10.

1915
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,639
um whereas if it's like

1916
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,600
yeah exactly

1917
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:52,000
exactly so the batch size there's no

1918
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,719
right batch size yeah right yeah you've

1919
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,480
got to figure out for your context with

1920
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,600
your type of work with your type of

1921
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,800
delivery

1922
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,280
what is

1923
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,360
the the most optimal batch size for our

1924
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,080
moment in time based on what we're doing

1925
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,080
and that may change over time as well

1926
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:11,199
but in general

1927
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:13,280
in general smaller is better

1928
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:15,360
in general

1929
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:18,239
what are what are other batches garden

1930
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,239
that we use at work

1931
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,520
five seems quite common

1932
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,679
um

1933
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,199
i don't know why i don't know why i was

1934
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,480
thinking of types of work that are

1935
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:30,639
batches

1936
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:32,239
ah

1937
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,800
so uh

1938
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:37,360
it's okay it's it's late for you is it

1939
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,560
not no it's not is it not like nearly 7

1940
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,920
p.m uh

1941
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,159
10 to 8.

1942
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:44,239
oh 10 to 8 okay only one our difference

1943
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,440
michelle what what what other types of

1944
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:47,679
batches

1945
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:50,560
also one hour difference

1946
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,280
also we're not different

1947
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,719
so

1948
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,040
tickets

1949
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,239
tickets tickets or batches yeah tickets

1950
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,199
are batches

1951
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,639
sorry

1952
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:01,760
cases

1953
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,880
yeah tickets casey's backlog items

1954
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,639
stories

1955
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,880
these are these are batches any other

1956
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,280
batches that what batches might use in

1957
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,280
scrum

1958
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:15,600
we have a sprint don't we

1959
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,840
yeah sprinter batch

1960
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:20,480
as well yeah here's the body of work

1961
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:23,360
that we're gonna do a release

1962
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,360
might be a batch if that's multiple

1963
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,480
bigger body of work

1964
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,080
right

1965
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,320
so so

1966
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:33,199
we have all these different sorts of

1967
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:35,199
batches that we just have to understand

1968
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:37,440
how they go through the system how are

1969
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,040
we delivering those things and

1970
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,600
knowing that bigger

1971
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:45,080
takes longer but there might be reasons

1972
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,080
to have things bigger

1973
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,239
hey

1974
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:57,600
uh so i am conscious uh that we are a

1975
01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:00,960
little bit over so i covered um a couple

1976
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:04,159
of these um already

1977
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,920
um and i just wanted to highlight that

1978
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:09,360
there are some good

1979
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:11,679
pieces of information uh that we can use

1980
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,560
to do a little bit of research obviously

1981
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,960
uh

1982
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,400
i'm trying to wet people's appetite with

1983
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,800
the mindset

1984
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:21,199
right so you go read some of the the

1985
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:23,360
content it's difficult to to teach a lot

1986
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:25,520
in an hour and a half

1987
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,760
there's the kanban guide for scrum teams

1988
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:30,480
so if you are a scrum team

1989
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,280
um working to deliver software

1990
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:34,639
you can help optimize your scrum get

1991
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,239
more effective

1992
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,239
at your scrum by using

1993
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:40,719
combat and the kanban guy for scrum

1994
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:43,679
teams is how did we do kanban within the

1995
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,560
context of scrum without breaking scrum

1996
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,400
right

1997
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,400
there's also the kanban guide which was

1998
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,960
released like i was going to say last

1999
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,159
year yes december 2020

2000
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,600
by daniel vicanti and

2001
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:58,400
the pro kanban

2002
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,719
community and that's focusing just on

2003
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,400
the core strategies

2004
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,719
of kanban

2005
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:07,360
right um so it's not looking there's

2006
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,760
also the kanban method

2007
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,880
which is taught by uh david anderson and

2008
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,199
lin kanban university and that is more

2009
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,280
than just the core strategy for kanban

2010
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,960
it's got a bunch of practices around it

2011
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,120
like scrum has a bunch of practices

2012
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,280
around it around an empirical process

2013
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:25,280
control system but the kanban guide is

2014
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,960
trying to distill that down

2015
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,120
to a very

2016
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:33,280
small group and there are two books that

2017
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:35,520
i really recommend um one is a practical

2018
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,320
kanban right that's the that's the easy

2019
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:41,040
one to read out of those two um

2020
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:44,880
practical kanban is a a a pretty good

2021
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,040
team-focused uh value-driven approach um

2022
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,600
and then flow

2023
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,800
if you really want to understand

2024
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,199
cues

2025
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,520
and how uh

2026
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:57,520
the math works

2027
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,960
for how that work flows through the

2028
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,520
system and then flow uh principles of

2029
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,400
product development is a really good

2030
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,239
book but if you don't have a math head

2031
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,719
thank you gregory if you don't have a

2032
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:12,159
math head then you're probably not going

2033
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:15,600
to have a good time with that book it's

2034
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:18,320
it's it's it's very mathy um so there's

2035
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,480
another book by daniel vicanti

2036
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,360
which is a lot easier to read while

2037
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,239
covering a lot of the same topics um and

2038
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,000
that's

2039
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:28,400
actionable agile metrics for

2040
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,159
predictability um and he actually has a

2041
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,280
new one which i've not read yet so i

2042
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:33,600
can't

2043
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:35,199
i don't know much about it yet but when

2044
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,280
will it be done but it sounds like a

2045
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,320
good book title doesn't it um that's

2046
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,440
something that

2047
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:45,679
everybody asks us when will it be done

2048
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:47,520
um and that's uh really important

2049
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:49,840
so i wanted

2050
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,320
to cover a a little bit more i wanted to

2051
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:54,000
do a little exercise with you uh around

2052
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,120
the three

2053
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,960
core practices in kanban um i don't

2054
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,600
think we have

2055
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,679
time to do it just now that's that's

2056
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,719
that's my fault we took a long time with

2057
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,800
that

2058
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:08,639
at coin game exercise i'm going to blame

2059
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,159
gordon that's for for asking too many

2060
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:12,080
questions at the start

2061
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:14,480
but maybe it was my explanation sucked

2062
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:16,800
us i would have definitely cheated if uh

2063
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,600
if i didn't ask as many questions

2064
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:22,159
yeah that's that's okay

2065
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,199
this it's always it's always the

2066
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:27,840
facilitator if timing is off it's always

2067
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:29,360
the facilitator and maybe i bit off more

2068
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:33,440
than i could chew there

2069
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:35,360
but the three core practices around at

2070
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:37,440
kanban the first one is defining and

2071
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,600
visualizing your workflow

2072
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:41,120
right whatever system you're using it

2073
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,080
doesn't matter whether you're doing

2074
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:46,320
waterfall make it up as i go along or

2075
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,280
scrum right whatever process you're

2076
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,159
doing

2077
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:52,000
define and visualize your workflow what

2078
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:54,320
are the stages that the work flows

2079
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,880
through why do things move between

2080
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:00,080
different columns why do you choose

2081
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,320
particular items so definition of done

2082
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:05,120
is your in the scrum world definition

2083
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,120
i've done is your leaving gate

2084
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,480
definition of ready might be your

2085
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,159
arriving

2086
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,760
gate right you're not going to pull

2087
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,760
things into your system until they're

2088
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,520
ready and so they're part of your

2089
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:18,159
definition of workflow and then you've

2090
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:20,719
got your columns and work flows

2091
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:23,280
generally from left to right garden

2092
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,520
generally from left to right

2093
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,239
through through different stages of work

2094
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,480
do you do some design do you do some

2095
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:32,639
analysis do you do some coding and do

2096
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,560
some testing and then do some validation

2097
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,239
and then it's done right and you've got

2098
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,800
to meet your definition of done

2099
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:41,199
so so while we're looking at the columns

2100
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,880
just saying back to the

2101
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:45,679
the first exercise we did where you said

2102
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,280
like each column doesn't need a work in

2103
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:49,199
progress as long as it sort of works

2104
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,880
with the overall workflow

2105
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,480
is that is that saying then that's the

2106
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,159
overall workflow you would have like

2107
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,840
regardless of what the limits are you

2108
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:58,320
still have a certain amounts of things

2109
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:01,360
in play at once at once yes

2110
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,679
so you you have to have a whip limit

2111
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:07,040
minimum requirement of of kanban is

2112
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:09,520
having a whip limit between the arriving

2113
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:12,639
work and the leaving work right you're

2114
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,480
starting work and you're finishing work

2115
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,719
and that's part of the second core

2116
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,239
practice which is actively managing your

2117
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,080
work

2118
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:22,960
right so not just looking at it and go

2119
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:25,760
oh look we've got too much stuff right

2120
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,920
um actively doing something about it

2121
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,440
yeah so in order to do something about

2122
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,239
it we need to count it

2123
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,679
yeah

2124
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:33,679
i was just thinking like every time

2125
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,960
every time i mean i've used this with

2126
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:38,639
the team we've always always used uh

2127
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,639
limits that are on each column as i

2128
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,840
suppose inherently the way to limit

2129
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,679
what's in the flow for the whole

2130
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,600
workflow but we've never looked at

2131
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,960
actually applying that i mean because

2132
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,280
we've never really looked at the book

2133
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,880
either to to do it academically how are

2134
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:52,880
we supposed to do it's sort of that

2135
01:29:56,239 --> 01:30:00,480
yeah we don't have a process we just

2136
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:03,440
drag [Â __Â ] across the board off the board

2137
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:05,600
well so i but it's the same as uh

2138
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:09,280
we we do scrum we store our work in jira

2139
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,280
and we stand up every day yeah

2140
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:15,120
same idea um so

2141
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,239
having understanding how much work you

2142
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:20,719
currently have in progress will help you

2143
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:23,040
understand um the limitations that

2144
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:25,840
you've got in your in your system

2145
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,600
generally not just reducing batch size

2146
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,120
but reducing the number of items that

2147
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,080
you have in progress

2148
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:34,320
tends to improve the flow of work

2149
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:37,280
through the system so the speed of an

2150
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:39,520
item um as it goes through the system um

2151
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,360
it just flows better and so they're

2152
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,840
they're the two biggest improvements

2153
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:46,320
that even a scrum team can make in their

2154
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,400
process is understanding their flow of

2155
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:50,880
work right so we need to

2156
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,320
visualize it so we can see what's going

2157
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,000
on because you know what it's like

2158
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,639
gordon when you when you don't look at

2159
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,159
that board with the 50 things on it it

2160
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,679
doesn't look like when you're looking

2161
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:01,280
down here that you've got 50 things

2162
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,719
you're working on because i'm working on

2163
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,960
two things but there were these ten

2164
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,800
things that were blocked yesterday yeah

2165
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,239
right so i took on these two new things

2166
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,239
which means i've got 12 things in

2167
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:12,880
progress that that

2168
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:15,360
that big the big number

2169
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,960
is the bit why have we got so much stuff

2170
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,400
in progress why are we not getting

2171
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,800
things done

2172
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:22,239
right and then in actively managing work

2173
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,880
you can look at

2174
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:26,560
how things are arriving into your system

2175
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,639
and how things are leaving

2176
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,800
from your system right

2177
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:32,400
that's what the cfd cumulative flow

2178
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,800
diagram is showing you

2179
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,600
right your average arrival vape versus

2180
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:40,159
your average leaving rate and then

2181
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,000
you ideally want two parallel lines

2182
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:43,920
really close together on your cumulative

2183
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,920
flow but you're never actually going to

2184
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,639
get that in the real world but the

2185
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,679
closer you get to two close parallel

2186
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:53,760
lines the more effective your system is

2187
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:55,280
being the quicker things are flowing

2188
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,679
through your system

2189
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,440
and usually you get big chunky bits you

2190
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,520
can always tell looking at cumulative

2191
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,560
flow for for uh for a team that's doing

2192
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,840
scrum because they have that big chunky

2193
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,280
you know we deliver at the end of the

2194
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,480
sprint we've got more work taken on

2195
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,960
deliver at the end of the sprint you've

2196
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,360
got a chunky uh cumulative flow going

2197
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,639
through so that's visualizing the work

2198
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,080
uh uh um and defining

2199
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,760
the workflow

2200
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:23,199
is the first

2201
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:25,040
core practice of kanban right so that's

2202
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:27,600
that's defining why things move what

2203
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:29,440
type of works do we have uh what type of

2204
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,080
works do we have what type of work do we

2205
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,639
have represented on the board stories

2206
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:37,199
bugs what are the support tickets what

2207
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:39,280
are they and then how they flow through

2208
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:40,480
the system what happens at each stage

2209
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:43,280
why they move

2210
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,719
and then actively managing that work by

2211
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,239
monitoring how many things we've got in

2212
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:49,840
progress and and taking steps

2213
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:53,040
to reduce those things that's part of

2214
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:55,280
improving uh the workflow so the last

2215
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,199
part is that improving the workflow make

2216
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,280
changes to your system

2217
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:01,679
see how those changes that you make

2218
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:05,679
affect the flow of work through that

2219
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:08,560
system and can continuously improve over

2220
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:09,760
time so if you look at the exercise we

2221
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,560
did

2222
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,120
the main thing we changed

2223
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,600
with each round was reducing the batch

2224
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:20,080
size and we got better numbers

2225
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,639
right but at some point you're not going

2226
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,560
to get better numbers you've reduced the

2227
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,400
batch size and you make it smaller and

2228
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,400
suddenly the numbers are worse okay well

2229
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,080
we found what might be our optimum batch

2230
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,239
size just now

2231
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,920
okay maybe maybe that's four right four

2232
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:34,960
is a good batch size for whatever it is

2233
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,960
we're doing

2234
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:38,880
now you've got four

2235
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,280
things flowing through the system you

2236
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,239
can then look at what else can we change

2237
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:47,199
right oh things spend a lot of time in

2238
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:49,360
waiting in testing before the testers

2239
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:52,320
can take it on have we got some kind of

2240
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:55,199
constraint there that prevents that work

2241
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:56,960
flowing more effectively where how do

2242
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,159
you visualize that well you can see it

2243
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,560
on the board

2244
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:01,360
right um so that you've got that cycle

2245
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,440
of

2246
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,520
visualizing the workflow actively

2247
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:07,679
managing the work and improving the

2248
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,040
workflow and there are four

2249
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,239
metrics

2250
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,440
um that we we want to look at as part of

2251
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:16,000
that system

2252
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:18,159
and you've got your work in process

2253
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,320
gordon that's the from when work started

2254
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:21,199
to when you agree it's finished

2255
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:24,880
okay

2256
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:27,600
um but you've also got the age of work

2257
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,120
in the system how long has something

2258
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,120
been sitting there

2259
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,040
and you can use that that's the data i

2260
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,960
would look at during my daily scrum for

2261
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,719
example right things that have been

2262
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,920
sitting there longer are less likely to

2263
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,760
get done

2264
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,920
and you're looking at your cycle time

2265
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,440
which is the time it takes for an item

2266
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,560
from when it started to when it finished

2267
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:47,360
then you could look at your average

2268
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:50,000
cycle time and then your throughput

2269
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:52,880
right that's number of items delivered

2270
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,880
per unit of time so in scrum you know

2271
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,880
times normally a sprint right but it

2272
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,199
could be five days 10 days 50 days

2273
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,159
whatever your unit of time is

2274
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:04,560
um and your throughput is is your

2275
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:07,920
average throughput is that measure of

2276
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:10,560
how quickly you're going to burn through

2277
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:13,199
your your your backlog right so if you

2278
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,360
want to increase your throughput you can

2279
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:17,199
reduce your batch size

2280
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:20,320
right that's one way to increase your

2281
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:22,719
throughput um or reduce your cycle time

2282
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:23,840
depending on what happens

2283
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,760
right you're not going to be able to

2284
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,000
control those two things through put in

2285
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,199
cycle time but you can control your work

2286
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,760
in process

2287
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:34,239
that's the one thing that you as a team

2288
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,840
have 100 control over

2289
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:38,000
is your work in process and if you

2290
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,080
reduce your working process either your

2291
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,800
throughput increases or your cycle time

2292
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,920
decreases or both right

2293
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,760
um

2294
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:49,840
because math

2295
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:51,600
right i should really have uh the the

2296
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,840
let me just grab it

2297
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,840
um

2298
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,440
i'm let me grab the one from

2299
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:02,000
[Music]

2300
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,000
i've got a little uh diagram

2301
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,159
a little formula

2302
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,239
that i should have put in here

2303
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:10,560
but i forgot

2304
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:13,520
um so let me just load it up for you uh

2305
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,719
but it's little's law

2306
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,719
or it's our uh

2307
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,880
a rendition

2308
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:23,360
of little's law in the software world so

2309
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:25,280
and this is from daniel vicanti and it's

2310
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,960
just a little formula let me grab it

2311
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:29,199
here somewhere there it is let me grab

2312
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,040
that copy image and then i should be

2313
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:34,400
able to paste it in here and i'll make

2314
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,400
it a lot bigger there we go

2315
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,360
so this is this is little's law

2316
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:41,520
and this is this is true

2317
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,560
uh regardless of whether

2318
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,560
you're waiting in a queue in the

2319
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,360
supermarket

2320
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,000
right

2321
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:49,360
or uh you've got work backing up in your

2322
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,080
backlog

2323
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:54,159
or your sprint queue right so your

2324
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,159
average cycle time

2325
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:59,679
equals the average work in process

2326
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,679
divided by the average throughput

2327
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:05,040
so there's two of these numbers that are

2328
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,679
very difficult for us to control

2329
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,960
right average cycle time how fast things

2330
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,320
get done

2331
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,679
we

2332
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,719
we have no control over that in the

2333
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:16,880
software world none whatsoever

2334
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,639
how many items we deliver we probably

2335
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,480
have no control over that or very little

2336
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,800
control over that it's very difficult to

2337
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:25,119
affect those two numbers

2338
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,440
but we can control average work in

2339
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:29,520
progress

2340
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,480
so gordon you're a mathematician aren't

2341
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,239
you

2342
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,960
what happens

2343
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:37,119
what happens if our average work in

2344
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,480
progress gets smaller

2345
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:40,320
but these other

2346
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,560
the the average throughput stays the

2347
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,560
same

2348
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:49,840
what happens to cycle time

2349
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,679
so you get less

2350
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:55,520
less work in progress

2351
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,520
and if you have less work in progress

2352
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,679
and throughput stays the same cycle time

2353
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:01,760
will get smaller

2354
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,920
will deliver the same number of items in

2355
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,320
a shorter period of time

2356
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,560
yeah yeah if average working process

2357
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:12,320
gets smaller and cycle time stays the

2358
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,320
same throughput will get smaller

2359
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:20,239
okay so the one thing we can control

2360
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,480
is the amount of work we currently have

2361
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:23,600
on our plate

2362
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,000
and that's the thing that we need to

2363
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,000
reduce

2364
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,800
if you want to know all the math behind

2365
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:33,360
it go go read daniel's book

2366
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,080
right that's probably the the the best

2367
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:36,960
book if i was to pick anything to go

2368
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,360
read

2369
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,719
um is probably actionable ideal metrics

2370
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,480
for predictability

2371
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,719
right it's called an introduction and

2372
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:47,440
it's got all the graphs that you see

2373
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:49,199
kanban teams use right and it explains

2374
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,119
exactly how they work what a good one

2375
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:53,600
looks like what a bad one looks like

2376
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:55,840
what to look for in the data aberrations

2377
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,520
in there so that you can visualize and

2378
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,960
see what's going on

2379
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,880
and that's that's really important

2380
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,159
having those information radiators being

2381
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,159
able to visualize that work

2382
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:12,480
so i think that's all we've got time for

2383
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:16,000
i'm kind of seven minutes over i saw a

2384
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:19,280
few people had it dropped off already um

2385
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,920
i would definitely like some feedback

2386
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:25,360
um and i think i know quite a lot of the

2387
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,880
feedback is going to be around um

2388
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:29,360
timing

2389
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,480
this one is a lot harder to bring

2390
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,239
together

2391
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,719
a flow discussion is a lot harder to

2392
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:36,880
bring together in a short period of time

2393
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,040
um and

2394
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,600
i will need to

2395
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,800
pivot and experiment

2396
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,800
differently

2397
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,480
uh to try and

2398
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:50,080
um get these things across a little bit

2399
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,080
more easily what do you think gordon

2400
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,040
yeah yeah

2401
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,040
i was just trying

2402
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,480
this oh it's the was the mural slow for

2403
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,480
people

2404
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,840
or i know there was a few people that um

2405
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:19,280
struggled to get on the mural if you've

2406
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,600
got a slow machine

2407
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,119
mural mural kind of sucks

2408
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,199
for sure if you have poor internet

2409
01:40:23,119 --> 01:40:27,360
access it takes a long time to load i do

2410
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:29,199
know that this is quite a small mural

2411
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:32,080
compared to the ones that i i normally

2412
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:34,239
use for training um

2413
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:37,639
but as it turns out i had i had too much

2414
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:37,639
content anyway

2415
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,880
how do you swim lanes come into the

2416
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,560
picture

2417
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,880
does that work with the priority thing

2418
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,400
or is it more just a categorization like

2419
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,320
how does that affect your work in

2420
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,920
progress

2421
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,159
so you're talking about the horizontal

2422
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,000
swim lanes yeah yeah

2423
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:58,800
uh so there's a really good video from

2424
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,840
daniel vicanti about swim lanes on on

2425
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,639
how

2426
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,400
usually it's um

2427
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:07,119
the swim lanes are

2428
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:09,600
categories of service

2429
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:12,239
i think is the phrase that they use

2430
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,280
um so you might have an expedite

2431
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:16,800
lane yeah and then a normal lane so most

2432
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,159
work goes in the normal lane and you can

2433
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,560
have and then you maybe limit the

2434
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:22,800
expedite lane to one item

2435
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,199
right so that one item flows faster

2436
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:27,199
across the board uh but daniel vicanti

2437
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:29,360
does a good talk on why that sucks and

2438
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:30,400
makes everything worse

2439
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,560
yeah i was

2440
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,560
just

2441
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,400
um

2442
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,960
so

2443
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:50,080
you you can either not break your whip

2444
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,199
limits

2445
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:53,119
or

2446
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:54,480
there's nothing in in

2447
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:56,000
in kanban

2448
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:58,080
right in the kanban guide that says you

2449
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,400
can't break your whip limits yeah sure

2450
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,000
but i mean the the

2451
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,400
the idea of it being there is because

2452
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,800
it's a good idea not to break them yes

2453
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:08,719
right it's definitely a good idea so

2454
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,480
what what i normally see teams do is

2455
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:12,560
they have their normal body of work and

2456
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:15,199
then they have an expedite lane and the

2457
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,480
ex by expedite lane has a whip limit of

2458
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:18,480
one

2459
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,480
okay so they're only adding one more

2460
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,199
thing to their process

2461
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,920
but

2462
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:26,239
there's a massive negative impact like a

2463
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:29,360
knock-on effect of that one thing

2464
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:31,760
getting priority time instead of maybe

2465
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,280
you normally pick the oldest thing

2466
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,480
on your back clock

2467
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:38,239
right um so so it's definitely a little

2468
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:40,480
bit worrying

2469
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:43,199
uh

2470
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,719
to have have an expedite lane i've seen

2471
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:47,199
it be successful with teams and i've

2472
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,800
seen it be a complete car crash um so i

2473
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:52,159
you

2474
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:54,560
project managers like them because

2475
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:57,280
it means they can prioritize stuff like

2476
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,040
here's the p1 stuff and the rest

2477
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,960
um but it tends to have a negative

2478
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:04,080
impact on our ability to deliver

2479
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,560
uh i'll need to look out i'll post the

2480
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:09,760
the video from daniel and i'll try and

2481
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:12,400
find it and post it on the on the on the

2482
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,360
community page um

2483
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,280
because i think that's going to be the

2484
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:18,000
easiest way to get it out to folks

2485
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:20,960
because the chat in this disappears when

2486
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,920
we all disconnect so that so

2487
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:26,080
i suppose maybe then a a good way in my

2488
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,760
mind with what we said now a potential

2489
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:30,080
good way to

2490
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:32,560
have swim lanes is to

2491
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:34,800
have them have them for the the value to

2492
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,239
customer so it's just a visual

2493
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:39,480
categorization

2494
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:39,480
like yeah

2495
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:47,119
i suppose if you're prioritizing stuff

2496
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,360
from the top anyway you have value

2497
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:51,280
generally at the top of that list right

2498
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,280
and just because it's high value doesn't

2499
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:55,040
mean you're going to do it

2500
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,639
yeah yeah

2501
01:43:55,040 --> 01:44:00,880
right if you if you look at holistically

2502
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:03,760
it's it's

2503
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,960
this is gonna cost a million dollars to

2504
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:09,520
deliver but the value is 500 000

2505
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,159
yeah yeah it's not worth doing even

2506
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:14,639
though 500 000 is a lot of value

2507
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:16,080
yeah so so you need to balance the value

2508
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:19,040
with the effort

2509
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:21,600
or the risk as well the complexity of

2510
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:24,239
delivering there's uh i i don't i'm not

2511
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:26,000
going to open it just now um

2512
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,679
there's a topic that i do want to cover

2513
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,080
on value

2514
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:29,199
um

2515
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,440
[Music]

2516
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:33,679
you know for for product ownership

2517
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:36,159
determining value and determining what

2518
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:38,159
or how we order our backlog and you need

2519
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:39,360
to take into account value effort and

2520
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:41,440
risk

2521
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,199
right because the risk is going to come

2522
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,280
into that too

2523
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:46,639
yeah yeah

2524
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,400
so um

2525
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:51,280
it would be awesome if

2526
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:54,400
folks if you've got ideas not just new

2527
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:57,199
ideas to try but topics you want to

2528
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:58,480
cover um i hadn't decided yet on what

2529
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:01,119
the next session is going to be in two

2530
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:02,800
weeks obviously i need to work on timing

2531
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,920
right that's going to have less less

2532
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,480
content

2533
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,440
more discussion um

2534
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:09,600
but

2535
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,119
what are the topics michelle if you were

2536
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:14,239
if you were coming back in two weeks

2537
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:14,239
what topic would you like to

2538
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:20,080
cover i

2539
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:21,360
i want to understand better about kanban

2540
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,119
and flow because i don't have any

2541
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,639
background knowledge about these things

2542
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:27,119
so

2543
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:29,119
i've got the practice from the exercise

2544
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:32,320
but i haven't really got the theory yet

2545
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:33,920
yeah yeah i i totally if you if you read

2546
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,440
the kanban guy for scrum teams and the

2547
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,560
kanban guide

2548
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:38,560
are your teams doing scrum

2549
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:43,440
are you are your teams doing strong yeah

2550
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:45,520
yeah kanban guys for scrum teams then um

2551
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:47,520
is is what i would recommend

2552
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,520
and that's a good place to start so it's

2553
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,560
a it's a short

2554
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:54,080
i think it's like a as a 12-page guide

2555
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:57,040
just like slightly scrum guide but

2556
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,560
here's a an addendum for the scrum guide

2557
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:00,719
that says how you introduce the combat

2558
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,360
ideas um

2559
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,360
it's very difficult to cover

2560
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,840
the kanban theory

2561
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:11,119
in in the period of time that we have

2562
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:13,920
here um i do i do an exercise with teams

2563
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:15,360
as part of the kanban training um with

2564
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,199
the the

2565
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,159
we play the get kanban

2566
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,360
game

2567
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:21,199
um i don't know if you've seen that

2568
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,960
board game but there's an actual there's

2569
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:24,880
a physical board game i have copies of

2570
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:27,920
it here and but there's also a digital

2571
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:30,080
version but it takes about two hours to

2572
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,520
just to play the game and then probably

2573
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:32,800
takes two hours to do the debrief

2574
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,639
afterwards

2575
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:39,520
um so i have i have done that for

2576
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,639
just that part for teams before for for

2577
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,760
companies

2578
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,280
um

2579
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,080
and that that can be super valuable in

2580
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:48,639
just understanding that flow of work um

2581
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,920
but i can certainly we can have a chat

2582
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:51,119
about the

2583
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,040
the theory

2584
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:54,880
um but it's definitely a lot i

2585
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,400
definitely recommend the the material

2586
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,760
that i put in the

2587
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,239
notes there

2588
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,719
but i totally get it michelle at this

2589
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:04,400
the lean flows this is the real the real

2590
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:05,760
struggle that we have

2591
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,000
as an industry

2592
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,159
is that velocity and story points is

2593
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,480
easy but useless

2594
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:15,520
right the kanban metrics are awesome but

2595
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:17,520
super hard to understand super hard to

2596
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:20,080
to implement and super hard to get value

2597
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,840
from because they take a lot of effort

2598
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,679
and brain power to interpret and

2599
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,600
understand and collect and change the

2600
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:27,280
way you do things

2601
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,520
that that's that's i think going to be

2602
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:32,239
the bit the next big struggle

2603
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,159
uh for for teams and organizations is

2604
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:35,440
that the canva metrics are awesome but

2605
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,199
they're super hard for people to

2606
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:38,880
understand

2607
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:40,320
and they're counter-intuitive to

2608
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,840
people's traditional understanding of

2609
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,800
how work works

2610
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,880
right

2611
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,639
michelle i've got this other these five

2612
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,040
projects i need you to show progress on

2613
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:51,280
all five of these projects at once

2614
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,400
right and that's that's so dumping all

2615
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,800
this

2616
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:56,480
whip on top of you uh

2617
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,080
is not gonna help you deliver stuff

2618
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,000
faster it's gonna help you deliver stuff

2619
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:03,119
slower um but

2620
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,360
if we were doing boring repetitive stuff

2621
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:07,199
it might you know we might be able to

2622
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,960
make progress on it but it just it's

2623
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:11,760
slow there's a really i'll post it in

2624
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:15,440
the the the the community there's a

2625
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:18,880
video that demonstrates that uh the the

2626
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,480
the the downtime for switching process

2627
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,000
perfectly i'll post that one as well

2628
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,840
that's a really good one

2629
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,840
so i'll post that because i saw michelle

2630
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,639
you joined the community thing i think i

2631
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,960
saw

2632
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,719
um so i do encourage i'm i'm switching

2633
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,400
over to a different system i was running

2634
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,800
everything in microsoft teams

2635
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:38,080
uh but microsoft team sucks for people

2636
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:40,400
engaging with it it's just uh not great

2637
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:42,159
for that so um i'm moving over to a

2638
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,480
different tool i can't even remember

2639
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:47,360
what it's called uh but it look it's

2640
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,040
community.nkd

2641
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:50,800
i have a link on my website and you

2642
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,080
should be able to just go join

2643
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,159
um

2644
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:56,159
and i'm going to start adding a bunch of

2645
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:57,600
content in there and hopefully we can

2646
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,040
get some conversations going in there

2647
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,639
michelle

01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,800
and we can either set up a call have a

2666
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:40,159

whatever helps us get to the better

2669
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,000
learning

2670
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:48,320
okay

2671
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,719
so i have not decided what i'm going to

2672
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:51,599
do in two weeks i saw some people asking

2673
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,119
for

2674
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:55,280
um

2675
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:57,440
oh somebody's asking really important

2676
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,400
question for me when's the next psk

2677
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,679
class

2678
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,360
um

2679
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,960
i actually can't remember i have

2680
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,199
everything on

2681
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,960
my website i have i just did my schedule

2682
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:08,960
for the next six months

2683
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:11,360
and i know there's a psk on there

2684
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,800
somewhere um i've clicked the button to

2685
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,719
load it

2686
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,599
because my machine is doing a lot when's

2687
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:21,520
my next psk it will be purple

2688
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:25,040
29th of november at four half days

2689
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:27,520
uh 8 30 a.m till 12

2690
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:30,880
um gmt so

2691
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:33,360
that's utc plus wha no gm

2692
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,520
gmt that's back into utc

2693
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,719
because the times change michelle

2694
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:39,040
you know when you're coding up that

2695
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,080
stuff is really hard

2696
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,960
yeah

2697
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,840
yeah

2698
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:46,239
um last week of uh

2699
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,679
yeah october isn't it yeah

2700
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,280
so um

2701
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,360
and i had to write the php that

2702
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:54,320
calculates that on my website

2703
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,520
not my proudest moment php's not fun

2704
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,239
um

2705
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,599
but

2706
01:50:56,239 --> 01:51:01,360
29th of november uh is the the psk class

2707
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:02,480
then i have another one on the 7th of

2708
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:07,159
march

2709
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,159
next year so that's a little bit away

2710
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,920
yes hello martin this is totally new to

2711
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,679
me and

2712
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,679
i am actually a change lead for an

2713
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:22,960
organization that's just trying to

2714
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,639
essentially get into agile right so

2715
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,520
the first agile project they basically

2716
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:29,119
use dsdm for all things yeah and now

2717
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,800
they're they're realizing that

2718
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:32,159
potentially the route that they might

2719
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,719
have to go is

2720
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,880
uh for like operational little changes

2721
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:39,520
that might just be using kanban yep and

2722
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:40,960
then for some other big very digital

2723
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,639
web-based kind of projects they might

2724
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:45,119
then be using scrum

2725
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:46,960
so you know i really would need some

2726
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:49,520
kind of i don't know what i say help or

2727
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,679
some kind of way that i can get the team

2728
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:54,000
to basically maybe attend a session or

2729
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:55,920
whatever it is i can use to get this

2730
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,760
this team working the way they shoot

2731
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,159
because it's obviously a very

2732
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,199
traditional and headstrong environment

2733
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:04,080
in terms of

2734
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:06,239
they're not understanding the power of

2735
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,920
agile in particular you know you know

2736
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,960
scrum or canvas i don't know whether

2737
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,360
there's any

2738
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:13,280
ways of helping or what else can i do to

2739
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:16,960
basically get these people going

2740
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:19,920
so the the the thing with kanban right

2741
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:23,119
is it's a strategy to optimize the flow

2742
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,920
of work through any system okay

2743
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:28,560
so you can use it regardless of what

2744
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,400
you're doing

2745
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,080
whatever it is you're doing

2746
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:34,719
you can use kanban to help you get

2747
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:37,199
better at it it's just a strategy

2748
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:39,280
so you just start you don't even need to

2749
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,400
mention kanban to them you just have to

2750
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:42,239
start with

2751
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:44,960
what i usually do is i do something

2752
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:48,560
called a board design exercise with

2753
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:51,199
teams and i basically i just use mural

2754
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,400
right because it's ultimately editable

2755
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:55,280
and

2756
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:57,199
let's build up build a board decide when

2757
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,719
work starts when it finishes what are

2758
01:52:57,199 --> 01:53:00,719
the columns we're going to have why do

2759
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:02,320
things move through the columns and just

2760
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:04,560
get them to write that down it's like

2761
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:07,280
it's like a working agreement

2762
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:09,920
right you find that most teams

2763
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,920
lose a huge amount of time because

2764
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:15,920
they're all doing something different

2765
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:18,239
every team member doesn't have the same

2766
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,520
understanding of how we're going to do

2767
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:22,239
stuff

2768
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:24,000
and that creates conflict and friction

2769
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:26,560
within the team that results in loss of

2770
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:28,000
time and loss of effectiveness so at

2771
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,159
least

2772
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,800
getting that visualization

2773
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:35,599
of your your your workflow and defining

2774
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:37,440
your workflow or your explicit policies

2775
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,199
for how you're going to do stuff but you

2776
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:40,719
don't tell them what their policies

2777
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:42,000
should be you get the team to come up

2778
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:44,080
with them

2779
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,639
because the team has to own them

2780
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:48,320
build those things do do that type of

2781
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,960
workshop with them

2782
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:53,520
that's the first stage then the next

2783
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:56,320
stage is actively managing the work look

2784
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,960
at that visualization you've created you

2785
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:01,760
can build boards in jira you can build

2786
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:04,560
boards in azure devops and there are

2787
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,080
many other tools out there uh

2788
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,400
canva eyes

2789
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:10,960
that you can just build a board in and

2790
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:13,040
then we use we use it as your devops

2791
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:15,119
that's what we use okay

2792
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:17,920
that makes gordon and i happy yeah our

2793
01:54:15,119 --> 01:54:20,000
planner as well um pl

2794
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:22,880
planner is not the most awesome tool but

2795
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,360
it does do the job same as trello you

2796
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:27,679
can use trello as well um but having

2797
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:30,800
that visualization of work and as your

2798
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:33,040
devops will let you set up the columns

2799
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,360
and have have

2800
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:37,040
set up the whip limits set up the the

2801
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,440
definite they call it the definition of

2802
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:42,159
done for each column right why what are

2803
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:45,119
the explicit policies for each column

2804
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:47,840
and why things move between the columns

2805
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:50,320
if i have that information explicit and

2806
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:53,679
then start tweaking it a little bit at a

2807
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:58,080
time yeah github projects v2 um is that

2808
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:58,080
even like can we use that yet garden

2809
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:04,000
you're on mute my friend you need one of

2810
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:06,159
these little green lights that i've got

2811
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,199
i think i was not on mute and then i

2812
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:12,159
clicked mute to talk

2813
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:13,760
so i think it's available for um

2814
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:15,840
public

2815
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,679
public orgs at the moment

2816
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,280
either that also in

2817
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:22,239
beta

2818
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:24,480
what's it called i know that github

2819
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:28,239
yeah get up projects v2 i think it is

2820
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:28,239
because it came with issues v2

2821
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:36,000
if i go look at my org it will tell me

2822
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:37,679
maybe give me some more info info there

2823
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,199
well i guess lots of people don't don't

2824
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:41,199
care i'm interested in that because i

2825
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:43,119
have a project on i have many projects

2826
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:45,679
on github and

2827
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:46,480
i want to know how to enable

2828
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:48,239
those

2829
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,679
features

2830
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:51,599
are they just enabled or do i have to go

2831
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:53,760
do something

2832
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,560
um so it's in beta at the moment i'm

2833
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:57,679
assuming it's private uh beta so

2834
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:59,520
yeah probably

2835
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:01,360
probably have to email somebody

2836
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,239
i don't know who you can

2837
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:06,960
he can get hold of that yeah yeah uh

2838
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:08,960
i'll email myself

2839
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,280
yeah i mean i'll i'll take a look if i

2840
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,080
can see anything that sort of

2841
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,000
i mean

2842
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:16,800
if you look at the i suppose let's go

2843
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,119
straight to issues feedback um so maybe

2844
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,520
projects is part of issues or at least

2845
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:23,280
lumped with it yeah so dennis is just

2846
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:24,800
saying that he really likes the delivery

2847
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:26,960
plans feature that they've added in

2848
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:30,560
azure devops and i do too it does

2849
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,920
dependency management as well um it's

2850
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,880
pretty awesome

2851
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,960
uh

2852
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,639
i've been using that a lot with some of

2853
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:40,239
my customers and they're really enjoying

2854
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:42,880
using it um so i i work with a number of

2855
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:44,400
organizations around the world

2856
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,639
uk

2857
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:48,800
ghana nigeria

2858
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:51,199
where else gordon

2859
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,920
well pretty much pretty much everywhere

2860
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:55,360
i think i've worked in 36 countries in

2861
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,719
the last 10 years

2862
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:00,480
um usually about 16 countries a year

2863
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,719
and that was before

2864
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:04,560
i wasn't allowed to fly anywhere

2865
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:06,800
now it's probably more because people

2866
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,719
just message me

2867
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,400

um i want to go back to the original

2901
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,480
time but i need to look at my my magic

2902
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:23,520
book

2903
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:25,520
garden i've got an actual diary

2904
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,320
physical diary yeah i have to look out i

2905
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,080
moved

2906
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,560
i moved to one of those

2907
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:32,560
a couple of months back yeah

2908
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,960
when you're tracking when technology

2909
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:36,719
can't track all the uh to do's that you

2910
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,560
have to do because it's

2911
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:39,840
the best knowledge is too fragmented

2912
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:41,599
across all the different companies i

2913
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:43,840
work with so i have everything written

2914
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:44,719
in my book that's my single source of

2915
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:48,159
truth

2916
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:49,840
um but i'm gonna um

2917
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:51,840
i'll post in

2918
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,599
well i'll do the usual post on linkedin

2919
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,280
but i'll also add it to

2920
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:58,080
uh um

2921
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:00,000
this new community portal i've created

2922
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:02,159
uh once i get it uh

2923
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,599
set well once i've decided what it is

2924
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:07,040
we're going to do

2925
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:07,040
victoria did you have a question

2926
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:14,639
do

2927
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:16,560
it's around the kanban principles

2928
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:17,920
combined practices

2929
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:21,520
yeah i think as a principal some

2930
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:24,320
practices yeah so sometimes you read

2931
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:26,480
online and then it says the

2932
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:29,440
principles are six

2933
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:32,000
and then some say four yeah and then the

2934
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:34,159
practices some also say four

2935
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,360
and some say six and

2936
01:59:34,159 --> 01:59:40,639
i am actually very confused right now

2937
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:41,679
totally so i i would in

2938
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:44,719
um

2939
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:47,920
there's the kanban guide for scrum teams

2940
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:49,199
which lists four things

2941
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:51,920
okay

2942
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:53,760
because it's got to work with scrum

2943
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,800
and then there's the

2944
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,800
the

2945
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:00,639
kanban guide

2946
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:04,960
which lists three things

2947
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:07,360
three three x four practices

2948
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:09,920
what you find is

2949
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:12,800
there's there's kanban

2950
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,800
and then there's the kanban method

2951
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,719
which is a named framework

2952
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:19,119
from uh

2953
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,040
david anderson and that ha i can't

2954
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:23,040
remember how many practices that has

2955
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:24,960
does that have 16 no i don't think it's

2956
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,800
that six

2957
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:30,080
i don't i don't remember i'm not a

2958
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:33,199
follower of uh uh david's work um

2959
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:34,880
but uh there's there's they have a

2960
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:37,520
bunch maybe that's where the six comes

2961
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:40,400
from right that's the sixth four and the

2962
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:42,000
three and then we've got it but um what

2963
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:45,760
what they're trying to do with the

2964
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,840
kanban guide is get down to the core

2965
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:49,840
must-have practices

2966
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,840
lots of people use other practices just

2967
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,719
like when we're doing scrum

2968
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,320
right we also we also use

2969
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:58,080
burn down charts

2970
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,679
but burn down charts are not part of

2971
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,960
scrum they're just an extra thing that

2972
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:02,159
people do

2973
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,840
um

2974
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:05,679
and just like gordon and i had the

2975
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,840
discussion about things moving across

2976
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:09,280
the board from left to right right

2977
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:11,760
that's how it's right yeah that's a

2978
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,080
normal thing that kanban teams do but

2979
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:15,840
it's not part of the core we don't have

2980
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,440
to have that

2981
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,800
to be doing kanban

2982
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:21,199
um

2983
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,280
so so i i think

2984
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:24,560
go to the kanban guide and the kanban

2985
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:26,239
guide for scrum teams depending on

2986
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,400
whether you're doing scrum or not

2987
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:30,080
look there for the core practices and

2988
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:33,679
then there are other practices you can

2989
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:36,880
bring in from any other place you like

2990
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:38,320
right right right right okay but that

2991
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:40,000
that's definitely

2992
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:41,920
victoria i might do

2993
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,280
i'm going to take a note

2994
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,800
um

2995
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:47,599
uh

2996
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,719
kanban v's

2997
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,599
uh

2998
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:55,040
psk versus pk yeah

2999
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:58,080
um i i will do a post on the

3000
02:01:55,040 --> 02:02:00,719
um community group with

3001
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:02,400
a a discussion around that just to to

3002
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:05,840
help help you out with that just to

3003
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,840
focus on it okay

3004
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:11,199
so chef thank you so much just i guess

3005
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,360
why why is that an extra one in the

3006
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:14,719
psk versus pk

3007
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:16,080
professional camera and versus

3008
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,679
professional camera scrum why is there

3009
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:21,599
an extra practice core practice

3010
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:23,840
and then if you say if you if you post

3011
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,960
on that and add the where you found the

3012
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,960
six

3013
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,960
maybe we can start a discussion

3014
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,960
yeah okay we can just start discussion

3015
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:34,159
around well why is there six over here

3016
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,159
and okay where do they come from

3017
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,560
yeah

3018
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,480
everybody does something different

3019
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,000
there's no right or wrong way to do

3020
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:45,440
almost anything

3021
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,040
um everybody does their own thing and

3022
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:48,800
we've got to figure out what works well

3023
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:50,880
for us and what doesn't

3024
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:54,400
that's what it is

3025
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,400
empirical process control

3026
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:01,199
um

3027
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:03,679
so i guess that's a good segue to to

3028
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:05,599
wrap up 31 minutes over that's better

3029
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:08,560
this time gordon i think we were 45

3030
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:08,560
minutes over last time

3031
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:12,000
but now we're in the networking side

3032
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:14,159
networking is when everyone goes home

3033
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,239
right yeah exactly

3034
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:17,920
when the pub kicks you out

3035
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:19,440
yeah we can't we can't go to the pub

3036
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,920
anymore well we can probably go to the

3037
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:23,440
pub again but i i don't know none of my

3038
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,239
none of my friends

3039
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:28,800
go to my local pub

3040
02:03:26,239 --> 02:03:33,280
because all of all of my friends are in

3041
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:35,679
uh uh south south africa like uh gordon

3042
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:37,199
or ghana like victoria

3043
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:41,719
um

3044
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:41,719
anna where where are you in the world

3045
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:50,719

balkan macedonia ah

3047
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,679
so

3048
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:55,760
we we can't just all go to the bob

3049
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:57,599
garden

3050
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,320
well as i said every time we go to mvp

3051
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:02,000
summit it's like it's a very tiring week

3052
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:04,239
but it's the one week a year where i see

3053
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:06,480
all my friends like

3054
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:10,159
i know so we'll we'll maybe need to have

3055
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:12,320
a have a have a online

3056
02:04:10,159 --> 02:04:13,360
i like rum rather than beer but some

3057
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:16,320
kind of

3058
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:16,320
uh yeah

3059
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:20,719
some kind of beer thing going on

3060
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,000
online cocktail yes dennis some kind of

3061
02:04:20,719 --> 02:04:24,239

cocktail session

3063
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:28,400
that would be good

3064
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,760
although i'd we we

3065
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:32,639
won't be able to live stream it because

3066
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,639
we might say thanks

3067
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:38,400
we'll talk about our companies

3068
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,000
okay well i think i think we should wrap

3069
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,719
it up um

3070
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,760

really run this session

3074
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:53,599
in this format definitely needs a lot of

3075
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:55,840
work i agree

3076
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,679
