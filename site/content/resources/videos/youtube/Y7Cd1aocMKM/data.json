It is known for leveraging cool things, like #lego and #minecraft, to help embed the learning experience and allow people to practise #scrum in a meaningful way.\n\nWhen you've spent your whole working like using #projectmanagement, the transition to an #agileframework can be transformative. It's like all the things that held you back in the past just evaporate and you've now got an approach that helps you navigate complexity and solve complex problems.\n\nSo, how do we achieve that same level of engagement, interaction, and transformative learning experience using live, online training?
