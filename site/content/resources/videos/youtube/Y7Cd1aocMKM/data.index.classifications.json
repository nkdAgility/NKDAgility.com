    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly compares digital and in-person Scrum training, highlighting techniques and advantages related to agile education. However, there is no explicit mention or focused discussion of 'Definition of Workflow' in the Kanban/agile sense—no references to policies, WIP limits, workflow entry/exit criteria, or related concepts. The piece is primarily focused on training methodology, audience experience, and cultural aspects rather than value stream or workflow modeling. While the audience is generally agile practitioners, the content does not intersect with the Definition of Workflow category scope beyond the distant relationship Scrum/Agile topics may have. The low confidence score reflects the absence of direct, substantial, or relevant coverage.",

While there are some generic references to scrum teams and agile practice, it never explicitly or implicitly covers the Product Developer accountability, skills, behaviors, or integration with sprint goals/backlogs.

However, it discusses human collaboration in distributed, digital environments, not human-AI collaboration or the emergence of collective intelligence as specified. There are no direct mentions or explicit discussions of humans partnering with AI agents, and AI is not referenced as a collaborative team member. The core emphasis is on human-to-human learning and interaction using digital platforms, with no exploration of distributed cognition or decision-making frameworks involving AI. Audience and signal scores are higher, as the audience overlaps and the content is focused, but conceptual and direct fit is limited.",

The main intent is to advocate for digital training efficacy, not the deliberate design of agentic engineering practices, feedback-driven adaptation, or ethical AI collaboration in software engineering.
