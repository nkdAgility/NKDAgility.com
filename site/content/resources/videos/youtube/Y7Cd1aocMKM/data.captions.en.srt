1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,099
a really interesting question so

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,420
um the question is

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,880
is

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,100
digital delivery of training of live

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,440
training classes

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,060
um as effective as in person

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,400
and

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,119
there's there's really there's the the

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,640
SE are just answering the question right

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,880
which is no it's not

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,480
right I mean that that is ultimately in

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,000
in person is higher bandwidth

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,879
um and it's more engaging right

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,219
but but the other part of the question

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,920
is which would you rather participate in

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,140
and is it better and I would say yes it

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,440
is better and I would rather participate

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,700
in a digital delivery than I would in an

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,559
in-person delivery and there's a couple

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,039
of reasons why

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,039
so

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,379
I believe

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,960
that using techniques pulling in as many

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,220
techniques as you can I I use techniques

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,619
from Trading from the back of the room

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,600
from liberating structures at my own

27
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,640
Creations based on you know mushing

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,119
those things together

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,040
um using those techniques you can get 90

30
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,040
of the way

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,619
to an in-person delivery right

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
but in the in the digital space you get

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,920
some added benefits

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,619
um

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,200
that I think were only just getting an

36
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,979
idea of how big those benefits are

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,380
for me personally one is that I like

38
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,600
teaching training courses where I have

39
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,340
people in the training from all over the

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,400
world

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,759
I'm I taught a training class uh today I

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,460
was teaching an APS today and I had

43
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,780
um one person from the US a bunch of

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,360
people a couple of people from Europe

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,380
some people from India and somebody from

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,780
from Asia from Asia Pacific right APAC

47
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,399
um all in the one class right so you've

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,380
got different different accents

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,479
different understandings different

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,160
interpretations

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,440
um different ways of looking at the

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,900
world all coming together and

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,800
influencing and cross sharing with each

54
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,800
other

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
right so there's there's more more of

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,400
that

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,000
I like digital delivery better because

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,340
it is more accessible to people

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,080
um I'll teach our our training class and

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,420
I'll have 10 people

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,300
um book from from Africa

62
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,160
right I'll have uh 10 people in the

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,920
classroom Africa a couple of people from

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,500
Europe a couple people from the US

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,459
um and and that's a training class

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,319
those folks in Africa might not have

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,360
been able to participate if we were

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,920
doing it in person because it becomes so

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,260
much more expensive

70
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,800
right we've we've when you do it in

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,019
person class you've got to have a room

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,860
availability you've got to get all the

73
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,200
people

74
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,540
into the one place you've got to fly the

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,420
trainer in

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,159
and teach the class you can only it only

77
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,599
really makes sense if you do two full

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,040
day classes which I don't teach anymore

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,500
because I don't think they're as

80
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,180
valuable so you have to do two full day

81
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,040
classes because it's not economically

82
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,659
viable to do four half days and you've

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,840
got a trainer on site for four days

84
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:28,680
right and

85
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,300
it gives that flexibility to the people

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,099
in your team because you're able to then

87
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,019
do four half days

88
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,819
so they can take a little bit longer to

89
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,680
absorb the information they can absorb

90
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,319
some information try it in the afternoon

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,720
we could do longer times but that seems

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,040
to work pretty well as well

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,860
um

94
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,360
you don't have to fly people around you

95
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,739
don't have to pay all of those expensive

96
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,599
things

97
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,540
um I I just think it's it's

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,620
fundamentally fundamentally better

99
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,260
um

100
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,560
the other thing the next thing that I

101
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,799
think is is hugely valuable is how are

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,500
your teams currently working

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,459
and that's that's that's my my kind of

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,700
that's my mic drop one right is if your

105
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,160
teams are currently working in person

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,739
and go to the office every day

107
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,979
and sit five days a week together in the

108
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:25,199
office and and build products then

109
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,800
absolutely you're going to get bigger

110
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,840
benefits from flying a trainer in having

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,940
an in-person class doing it over two

112
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,500
days and everybody's working in the same

113
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,960
way that they currently work

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,680
but that's not how

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,380
most people in our in in in in my sweet

116
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,880
spot of Industry right which is it and

117
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,560
software teams

118
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,300
they're virtual

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,340
they're sitting at home even if they're

120
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,960
even if they're hybrid right and

121
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,820
everybody has to come in two days a week

122
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,740
does everybody on your team pick the

123
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,560
same two days to come in no they don't

124
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,780
right so all the meetings all of the

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,540
conversations are all done on teams or

126
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,340
Zoom or whatever platform you've got

127
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,040
they're all online so you have your

128
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,419
teams have to figure out how to engage

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,400
online how to collaborate online and how

130
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,320
to discuss and get the most out of

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,120
online because even your customers are

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,699
not coming on site anymore to talk to

133
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,900
your teams they're wanting a virtual

134
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,300
call right so if we if I teach a

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,340
training class over four half days

136
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,620
online

137
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:37,380
the the students learn not just the

138
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,440
content of the material but the meta

139
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,419
information around how does Martin run a

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,160
class online

141
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,220
what are the tools and techniques that

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,500
Martin is using to run the class so that

143
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,180
we might be able to use them as well

144
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,039
you know I've heard of this liberating

145
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,860
structures thing but how do I do an

146
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,660
impromptu networking with breakout rooms

147
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,520
in Microsoft teams

148
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,680
well you're going to experience that in

149
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,259
my class and then you can go use that

150
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,100
with your customers so I I think they're

151
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,900
learning more than

152
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,759
um they would do in an in-person class

153
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,160
because they're learning about how to

154
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,660
engage how they work

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,660
that's that's my favorite part
