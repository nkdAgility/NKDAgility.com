A really interesting question. 

So, the question is, is digital delivery of training of live training classes as effective as in-person? 

And there's really, there's the SE are just answering the question, right? Which is no, it's not. 

Right? I mean, that is ultimately in-person is higher bandwidth and it's more engaging, right? 

But the other part of the question is, which would you rather participate in and is it better? And I would say yes, it is better and I would rather participate in a digital delivery than I would in an in-person delivery. 

And there's a couple of reasons why. 

So, I believe that using techniques, pulling in as many techniques as you can. I use techniques from Training from the Back of the Room, from Liberating Structures, and my own creations based on, you know, mushing those things together. 

Using those techniques, you can get 90% of the way to an in-person delivery, right? 

But in the digital space, you get some added benefits that I think we're only just getting an idea of how big those benefits are. 

For me personally, one is that I like teaching training courses where I have people in the training from all over the world. 

I taught a training class today. I was teaching an APS today and I had one person from the US, a couple of people from Europe, some people from India, and somebody from Asia Pacific, right? 

All in the one class, right? So you've got different accents, different understandings, different interpretations, different ways of looking at the world, all coming together and influencing and cross-sharing with each other. 

Right? So there's more of that. 

I like digital delivery better because it is more accessible to people. 

I'll teach our training class and I'll have 10 people book from Africa, right? I'll have 10 people in the classroom from Africa, a couple of people from Europe, a couple of people from the US. 

And that's a training class. Those folks in Africa might not have been able to participate if we were doing it in person because it becomes so much more expensive. 

Right? When you do it in-person class, you've got to have a room availability, you've got to get all the people into the one place, you've got to fly the trainer in and teach the class. 

You can only, it only really makes sense if you do two full-day classes, which I don't teach anymore because I don't think they're as valuable. 

So you have to do two full-day classes because it's not economically viable to do four half-days and you've got a trainer on site for four days, right? 

And it gives that flexibility to the people in your team because you're able to then do four half-days. 

So they can take a little bit longer to absorb the information. They can absorb some information, try it in the afternoon. 

We could do longer times, but that seems to work pretty well as well. 

You don't have to fly people around, you don't have to pay all of those expensive things. 

I just think it's fundamentally better. 

The other thing, the next thing that I think is hugely valuable is how are your teams currently working? 

And that's my kind of, that's my mic drop one, right? Is if your teams are currently working in person and go to the office every day and sit five days a week together in the office and build products, then absolutely you're going to get bigger benefits from flying a trainer in, having an in-person class, doing it over two days, and everybody's working in the same way that they currently work. 

But that's not how most people in my sweet spot of industry, right, which is IT and software teams. 

They're virtual. They're sitting at home. Even if they're hybrid, right? 

And everybody has to come in two days a week. Does everybody on your team pick the same two days to come in? No, they don't, right? 

So all the meetings, all of the conversations are all done on Teams or Zoom or whatever platform you've got. 

They're all online. So your teams have to figure out how to engage online, how to collaborate online, and how to discuss and get the most out of online because even your customers are not coming on site anymore to talk to your teams. 

They're wanting a virtual call, right? 

So if I teach a training class over four half-days online, the students learn not just the content of the material but the meta information around how does Martin run a class online. 

What are the tools and techniques that Martin is using to run the class so that we might be able to use them as well? 

You know, I've heard of this Liberating Structures thing, but how do I do an impromptu networking with breakout rooms in Microsoft Teams? 

Well, you're going to experience that in my class and then you can go use that with your customers. 

So I think they're learning more than they would do in an in-person class because they're learning about how to engage, how they work. 

That's my favourite part.
