00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:26,180
um this year and one of the reasons that

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,760
that we decided to sponsor is that we're

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,220
we're Scottish we're a Scottish company

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,399
lived in other countries I I've spent a

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,239
lot of time traveling around the world

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,940
but I've always come back uh to to to

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,300
Scotland to to live

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,440
and I don't actually have

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,660
um although I don't have a lot of

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,980
customers in Scotland I'm always

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,899
interested in what folks are are doing

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,000

19
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,340

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,239
as well

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,880
um which is a great uh uh event regular

22
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,340
Meetup event where they they get the

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,020
some of the best speakers in the world

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,320
um and I think this is going to be the

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,420
same I had your 20 23

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,060

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,439
massive presence around the world

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,619

um and it was a fantastic event and I

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,780

little bit smaller scale

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,439
um but they're just starting out in

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,700

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,159
to be amazing lots of amazing speakers

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,140
