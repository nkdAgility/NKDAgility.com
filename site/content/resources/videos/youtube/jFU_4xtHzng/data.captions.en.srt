1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,480
question is why do I think that four

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,219
half days is a better format than two

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,559
full days

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:19,859
um I think it's a better format because

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,720
of two two things one is that it allows

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,160
um people to spend a little bit of time

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,460
absorbing

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,680
the content of maybe maybe reading up on

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,779
some questions and additional ideas that

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,000
they thought of during the class so over

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,980
four half days even if they're

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,140
consecutive

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,980
um people are able to

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,680
um

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,840
rearrange their filing cabinets I I I I

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,120
remember somebody telling me that our

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,559
brains are like filing cabinets it's

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,899
just a metaphor right but brings all

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,879
that filing cabinets and during the day

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,160
we're pulling stuff out and looking at

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,660
it and leaving it lying around and then

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,120
at night when we're sleeping our brain

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,399
goes and refiles everything uh

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,239
processing all of the events of the day

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,760
and that can solidify knowledge generate

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,860
more questions right so those that's why

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,260
I really like that four half day format

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,420
but in fact the four half day format is

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,900
is sub-optimal as well we're doing doing

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,080
everything within within one week

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,080
um so we're trying to move towards other

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,060
formats that might be more valuable

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,520
um so we're already starting to

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,900
introduce uh especially for private

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,299
customers

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,180
um classes of

37
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,020
um maybe maybe over two weeks four half

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,340
days over two weeks right so do Tuesday

39
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,560
uh Tuesday Wednesday Tuesday Wednesday

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,820
or

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,740
um longer immersive classes over a much

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,040
longer period of time so maybe maybe

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,220
eight half days over eight weeks

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,899
and that gives much more capability for

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,680
the people that are participating in the

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,920
class

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,320
to go and try stuff with their team try

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,960
stuff in their organization and then

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,399
come back around and in fact in the

50
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,520
eight

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,120
um half day format specifically for the

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,140
pspo the product owner class initially

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,860
um we're going to be giving them

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,660
assignments at the end of each session

55
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:21,720
so part of the next session will be a

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,459
debrief of the previous assignment and

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,500
That might be quite a lot of the time in

58
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,060
that session right here was an

59
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,680
assignment you had to go into your

60
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,420
organization try to do something

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,700
different try to work with the teams in

62
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,340
a different way what was the outcome of

63
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,620
that what's your feedback and and what's

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,080
going to be your next iteration on that

65
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,140
story so it's effectively the same as

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
the traditional product owner class but

67
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,280
we have the extra time to do the to do

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,400
the assignments and do the review of the

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,420
assignments the the debriefs and

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,560
hopefully

71
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,580
and create something that allows

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,200
more Loops of learning right

73
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,060
people are able to actually try things

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,900
with their teams close that feedback

75
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,700
loop with the trainer and perhaps learn

76
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,000
even more than we would in a normal

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,000
class
