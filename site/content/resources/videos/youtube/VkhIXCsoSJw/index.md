 Automate Everything: Boosting Engineering Excellence and Building Confidence

Automation is the cornerstone of engineering excellence. Whether you're developing simple features or managing complex systems like Azure DevOps, automation helps you build better products, fasterâ€”and with more confidence. In this video, I discuss why automating everything, from testing to deployment, is key to shortening feedback loops, improving code quality, and gaining customer trust.

ðŸ“š Chapters:

1. 00:00 Introduction â€“ Why automation is essential for complex product development.
2. 01:30 The Role of Batch Sizes â€“ Breaking down work into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. 03:00 Azure DevOps Case Study: Flipping the Pyramid â€“ How transitioning to fast-running unit tests revolutionized their process.
4. 06:15 Building Confidence in Teams and Customers â€“ Creating reliable systems to enhance trust.
5. 08:45 Automating Telemetry and Observability â€“ The Twitter Sentiment Bot and creative interim solutions.
6. 11:00 Pushing Boundaries with Automation â€“ How to continually improve your systems and processes.

ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:

â€¢ Software developers and engineering teams striving for continuous delivery.
â€¢ Product managers interested in improving deployment confidence and customer satisfaction.
â€¢ CTOs, team leads, and decision-makers aiming to modernize their engineering practices.
â€¢ Organizations managing large, complex systems with high interdependencies.

ðŸŒŸ What Youâ€™ll Learn:

â€¢ Why automation is critical for reducing time to learn and iterate on ideas.
â€¢ The impact of flipping the test pyramid: From slow system tests to fast unit tests.
â€¢ How automation builds confidence within teams and fosters trust with customers.
â€¢ Creative approaches, like the Twitter Sentiment Bot, to bridge automation gaps during transitions.
