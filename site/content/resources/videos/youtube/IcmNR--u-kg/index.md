*Innovative Immersion Training at NKDAgility*

NKDAgility's Immersion Training reimagines traditional classroom learning. Our approach involves:

- *Incremental Classroom Learning:* Short, engaging live sessions spread over several weeks, each lasting up to 4 hours. This structure allows learners to thoroughly understand each concept at a comfortable pace.
- *Outcome-Based Assignments:* Assignments linked to each session emphasize practical application and innovation, catering to various skill levels and backgrounds.
- *Facilitated Reflections:* Each class starts with a reflective session where learners discuss their assignment experiences with their Professional Scrum Trainer, fostering peer learning and actionable insights.

This Immersion Training is designed to offer a more interactive, reflective, and practical learning experience, ensuring not just knowledge acquisition but also application and growth. Join us for a transformative educational journey.
