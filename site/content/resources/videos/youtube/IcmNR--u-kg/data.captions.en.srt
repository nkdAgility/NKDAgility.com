1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,380
the question is how how does the immerse

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,960
at the new immersive learning experience

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,619
change the game in terms of entry-level

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,720
capabilities I I think it really

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,560
connects

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,960
the skills that people actually need

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,000
to the job that they're doing

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,680
because normally in a in a two-day

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,599
training class we're teaching a lot of

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,640
theory right it's actually very

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,559
difficult to connect that to people's

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,680
real world

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,559
um and we perhaps use ways to connect it

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,660
to something that they can then connect

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,920
to the real world

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,559
um but it doesn't

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,660
it's still single Loop learning right

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,980
they're still absorbing the content and

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,320
then they have to go figure it out for

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,820
themselves whereas the immersive

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,520
learning uh uh uh program allows

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,920
us to teach a small small amount of

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,619
content small amount of theory

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,320
and then they get seven days five six

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,140
days a week to go

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,840
figure out how do I do some of this

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,540
inside of my organization what's the the

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,360
the difficulties that we run into what's

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,100
the roadblocks that we hit what's the

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,840
questions that we get asked by other

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,900
people in our organization

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,939
and then come back closing that feedback

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,460
loop right making making learning an

34
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,360
empirical process and have that double

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,280
Loop learning where they're then able to

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,259
um have a conversation with the group

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
figure out how do we solve some of those

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,520
problems how do we answer some of those

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,820
questions how do we change some stubborn

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,500
ideas right some folks have have this is

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,880
the way I've always done things why

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
should I listen to you and do it a

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,420
different way

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,119
um and you can then start coming back

45
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,119
around and that's also why we include

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,280
additional uh coaching and Consulting as

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,380
well as part of our our training class

48
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,079
everybody just gets that so not only do

49
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,240
you get in an immersive class and get

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,459
that group

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
double Loop learning but you also get

52
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,020
individual learning as well where they

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,500
can come back and get additional

54
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,900
coaching as part of that program

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,700
