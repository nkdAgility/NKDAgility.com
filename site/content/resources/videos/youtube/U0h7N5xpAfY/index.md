# Why is training such a critical element in a scrum master's journey

People perceive the #scrummaster accountability to be a fairly junior, administrative role in #scrum but it's completely the opposite. It is a #leadership role that presents a #scrummaster as an #agilecoach that helps creative an environment where the team can thrive.

It's tough to know how to do that if you've never been trained or learned the necessary stances and skills. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the importance of #scrumtraining for a Scrum Master.
