1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,960
most scrum

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,320
Masters don't realize what's entailed in

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,920
being a scrum Master usually that's

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,839
because they've just been handed uh the

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,880
role by their organization um and

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,520
perhaps the role of scrum Master within

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,199
their organization is very different

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,320
from what I'm talking about with the

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,519
accountability of the scrum Master

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,960
within the context of scrum uh because

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,520
you know 25 years ago when scrum was

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,840
created um scrum master was a brand new

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,040
term that didn't have any baggage

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,399
whereas today it has just amount about

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,800
as much baggage if not more than any

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,000
other term out there um so as a scrum

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,280
master um you do need to

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,800
disambiguate the role that your

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,879
organization has perhaps the job title

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,960
right and all of the different

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,480
accountabilities that are included in

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,760
that that might be nothing to do with

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
scrum as well right that's fine

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,720
with the

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,119
accountability for the scrum Master

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,280
within the context of scrum um and that

27
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:14,479
accountability is for maximizing the

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,360
effectiveness of the team um that's

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,720
that's that's really the whole thing in

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:25,079
a in a nutshell and in order to do that

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,280
there are loads of tools that you need

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,360
in your toolbox there's loads of

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,360
practices and processes that that can

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,320
make sense in that space complimentary

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,360
practices to scrum um so there's lots of

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,960
things out with scrum that a scrum

37
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Master needs to understand in order to

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,799
be be as effective as possible but if

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,479
you have a brand new scrum team uh that

40
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,240
have never done scrum before they're

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,200
just starting out uh the first thing

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,520
that a scrum Master is a is accountable

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,439
for is is the knowledge that the team

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,320
have their understanding of scrum their

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,759
understanding of empiricism the scrum

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,880
values teaching those things is really

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,399
important for a scrum master and then

48
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,840
once your team gets beyond that

49
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,040
um engaging with not just the team but

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,120
the rest of the organization as well

51
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,280
remember the scrum Master not only has

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,080
accountabilities for the scrum team but

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,840
they have accountabilities for the to

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,760
the product owner and accountabilities

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,599
to the organization as well so enabling

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,239
a team to be as effective as it can has

57
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,920
much wider implications across the

58
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,760
organization um because usually once

59
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,400
you've dealt with the knowledge the

60
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,599
knowledge that the team have about

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,319
empiricism about uh uh working product

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,159
right and the value contained within

63
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,720
that um it's it's organizational

64
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,879
impediments that get in the way it's

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,599
things your organization is doing which

66
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,840
impedes the ability for the team to to

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,560
maximize its Effectiveness um and

68
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,400
getting focus on them so building

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,760
relationships within the organ

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,959
organization understanding the business

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,519
processes why they're there and

72
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,239
inevitably how to change them um is

73
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,920
critical role for a critical area of

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,440
understanding for the for the for the

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,040
scrum master so if you want to be um a

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,000
