# Why does Agile focus on values and principles rather than a prescribed set of steps?

Traditional #projectmanagement and legacy based organizations have always followed a set of prescribed rules, steps, and procedures to deliver a product or service. It's a process refined over years of practice, and in simple or complicated environments such as civil engineering, it works a treat.

The moment we encounter complexity, everything changes because we have never built the solution before nor have we ever solved the problem. We don't know what we don't know, and we don't know all the variables that may impact the process of discovering a solution.

So, we can't define the entire process upfront, as one does in #projectmanagement and there is no formula you can follow to ensure a successful outcome. What do you do? How do you navigate complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why #agile focuses on values and principles rather than following the #projectmanagement style of working.
