1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,160
but why does agile focus on values and

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,799
principles instead of a predefined set

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,320
of steps

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,539
um because there's no predefined set of

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,400
steps that will get the same outcome

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,720
every time in an agile space so that

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,580
that's where we start having that

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,100
conversation about the difference

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,019
between and however people want to

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,760
phrase it right because there's there's

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,000
different stories about how you would

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,420
you would articulate this but the way I

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,120
articulate it is that you've got

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,800
um you've got complicated work

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,620
right so this is about the work that

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,719
we're doing we've get complicated work

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,660
and if we apply

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,700
um best practices or good practices we

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,579
can turn this into into something simple

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,760
right so that's like

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,399
um whenever you go let's say you want to

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,500
do some DIY in the house uh DIY do it

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,979
yourself in the house uh you want to do

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,000
some some some home Home Improvements

25
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:11,760
and you don't know how to remove safely

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,040
remove the u-bend in the sink

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,200
you don't know how to do that I

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,600
guarantee you you can go to YouTube and

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,000
type in remove you bend and sync hit

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,100
enter and you'll find 20 YouTube videos

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,780
You'll watch three of them and now it's

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,759
a simple problem it's not a complex a

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,500
complicated problem at all anymore

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,659
right because you you know how to do it

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,020
you could probably even find a video

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,600
that has the exact same fixings as you

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,320
have uh on your sink right if you

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,020
watched a few of those videos

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,820
these are not hard tasks if you know how

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
to do them they're only hard because you

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,040
don't know how to do them you don't have

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,140
the knowledge

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,740
you've got these this complicated work

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,579
that when you apply knowledge it becomes

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,159
simple

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,020
right but then you've got this other

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
type of work which is

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,939
any time you're building stuff that

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,619
doesn't exist yet

50
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,160
right if you're building something that

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,760
doesn't exist yet there's no predefined

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,560
set of rules yet somebody has to

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,720
design the thing and then we create a

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,300
predefined set of rules like if you

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,420
wanted to design a brand new brand new

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,940
car brand new car platform

57
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,560
um you're not gonna it's not complicated

58
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,840
it's complex because you don't know what

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
the outcome is going to be

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,099
um but once you've built it you can then

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
create a production line and serve out

62
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,319
up lots of them that's you turning that

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,360
complex problem of Designing the new

64
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,099
product okay now we've got the

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
complicated problem of building the new

66
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,900
product we create the production line

67
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,280
and then we generate lots of lots of

68
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,319
things off it

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
but in the complex space every single

70
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,480
thing we do

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,400
is complex every single thing we do is

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
something that we've not done before

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,379
so if you're

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,440
um writing code right you don't go right

75
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,000
code that you've written before

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,099
because there would be no point it's

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
been written before so you would package

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,879
it up in a little framework and you

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,099
would reuse that little framework on a

80
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,200
constant basis so then that's that's not

81
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,019
complex work but everything you're doing

82
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,000
to wire up that thing is complex work

83
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,400
everything we do in software is brand

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,739
new anytime you're developing a product

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,140
that doesn't exist yet there are no best

86
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,000
practices there are only emergent

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,760
practices like what's the right thing

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,040
just now for what we understand just now

89
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,780
tomorrow it might be different in fact

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,940
in a couple of hours it might be

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,599
different right because the it's

92
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,299
changing so much and the thing that

93
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,180
happens in this space you can't make

94
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,860
this complicated right you can't make it

95
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,700
complicated there's no change between

96
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,680
that

97
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,239
and what happens in this space is we get

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,920
lots of surprises

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,900
right and some of them are positive

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,819
surprises that we want to go grab and

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,739
take advantage of and some of them are

102
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,019
negative surprises that we want to make

103
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,459
sure that we don't get you know don't

104
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,920
get messed up by that particular

105
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,299
surprise

106
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,040
loads of those types of things in the in

107
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,959
the software world but in almost any

108
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
industry when you're building brand new

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,680
products you're going to have surprises

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
right things aren't like you expect them

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,139
to be for whatever reason or something

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,340
happens the the impacts on what it is

113
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,840
that you're doing

114
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,780
so

115
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,639
the reason that agile focuses on those

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,100
values and principles

117
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,560
is that you

118
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,620
and your team and your company

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,400
need the tools

120
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,100
to be able to adapt to any circumstance

121
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,259
whereas as soon as you write down a way

122
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,840
to do things like here's a step-by-step

123
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,540
guide on how to do it and then the world

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,400
changes right your your world of how

125
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,259
it's going to work changes it's actually

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,240
harder to adapt to this because you're

127
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,520
like but I'm following this set of steps

128
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,080
right I want to follow the and this

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
one's failing why is this failing now

130
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,320
well it's because the world's changed

131
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,720
and when we enshrine things in here's

132
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,120
here's a way of doing something here's

133
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,360
one way that you should do this we

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,460
suddenly hit that problem of

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,400
we want to keep doing it that way and

136
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,919
it's harder to change whereas so we

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,419
focus on values and principles so we

138
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,979
don't enshrine if the word I normally

139
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,220
use for these enshrined things is

140
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,100
bureaucracy right the way we work you

141
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,740
don't enshrine them in the the the the

142
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,380
bureaucracy and you keep yourself Nimble

143
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,320
and adaptable and then hopefully what

144
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,960
you'll learn is to document and create

145
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,139
processes for the things that you can

146
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,419
move into that complicated space I.E

147
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,880
we've built something we need a process

148
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,220
for resetting users passwords we've

149
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,020
built a system here's the process to

150
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,120
interact with the system but if we're

151
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,680
adding new things to this system we

152
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,000
don't need the bureaucracy in order to

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,400
handle how we're doing that because we

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,160
want to be dynamic and adaptable but

155
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,660
then over here in using the thing we can

156
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,699
have the documentation and we can have

157
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,560
the processes and the the the rules on

158
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,300
how to do that

159
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,060
so that's why we focus on values and

160
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,060
principles and not just a set of rules
