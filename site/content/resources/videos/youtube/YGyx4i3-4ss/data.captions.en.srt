1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,879
maybe we have insufficient user

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:11,679
understanding maybe we believe that what

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,839
our users say is the truth well this is

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,640
what they say but guess what do we

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:23,359
really understand what is the need do we

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:28,320
have all data evidence to find the best

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:31,119
ways to bring solutions to fulfill users

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,760
needs this is a Val

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:39,640
question maybe we are facing reactionary

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,399
development okay customers want it

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,239
because competitors did it is it really

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,719
so that's another question maybe we are

13
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,359
facing insufficient collaboration with

14
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,800
our stakeholders and this is not the

15
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,800
healthy
