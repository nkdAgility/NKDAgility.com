Product backlog management is getting lots of attention right now because it is one of the most deficient things in organisations that I and my colleagues encounter. Most organisations do not have adequate backlogs; they do not have backlogs that represent transparency in the work that needs to be done, and they don't have enough information for people who, even within the context of that organisation, context of that product, to be able to explicitly understand what that thing is and what you're trying to do with it. That is hurting the ability of teams to deliver value. It's hurting the ability of organisations to understand what it is that, what the heck, the teams are doing at all anyway. 

That's why product backlog management is the biggest critical focus for organisations right now.
