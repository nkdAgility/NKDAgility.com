1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
product backlog management is getting

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,760
lots of attention right now because it

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,440
is one of the most deficient things in

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,120
organizations that I and my colleagues

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,160
encounter um most

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:21,279
organizations do not have uh adequate

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
backlogs they do not have backlogs that

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,279
represent transparency the work that

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,800
needs to be done um and they don't have

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,560
enough information for people who even

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,960
with within the context of that

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,719
organization context of that product to

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,480
be able to explicitly understand what

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,280
that thing is and what you're trying to

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,239
do with it um and that is hurting the

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,760
ability of teams to deliver value it's

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,600
hurting the ability of organizations to

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,600
understand what it is that what the heck

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,079
the teams are doing at all anyway and

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,680
that's why product backlog management is

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,800
the biggest critical Focus for

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,239
