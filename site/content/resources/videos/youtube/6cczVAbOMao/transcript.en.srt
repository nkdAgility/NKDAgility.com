1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,099
so the question is how critical is a

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,000
product owner in developing a great

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,020
product backlog if you look at the the

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,279
scrum guide then it will be um

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:26,340
absolutely imperative there the one that

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,220
decides makes the final decision the

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,040
Arbiter of the product backlog

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,899
um they they are responsible

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,460
um accountable for ordering the product

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,260
backlog

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,880
um although they can delegate it they're

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,680
responsible for the contents of the

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,420
product backlog although they can

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,260
delegate it

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,600
um but they are 100 responsible for

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,340
expressing and communicating the vision

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,660
and strategy that results in all of

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,940
those other things

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,100
so if you think about what you might put

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,079
in a product backlog you're not going to

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,539
know what to put in there unless you

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,640
know what direction you're going

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,320
um product backlogs can quite often

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,560
become just this massive Dumping Ground

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,780
of whatever crap anybody asks for at any

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,780
point in time and that's not what you

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,140
want you want your product backlog to be

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,000
uh uh uh uh

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,340
um short list a lean

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,840
inventory of the work that needs to be

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,700
done to maximize your value that you're

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,439
going to deliver to your customers which

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,000
means if you have 5 000 things in your

34
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,439
product backlog

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,079
um You probably don't have a product

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,360
owner right you've probably got somebody

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,280
who's just dumping stuff in there and if

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,680
a customer makes a request they just put

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,659
it in there perhaps that's not the right

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
customer request perhaps we should say

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,680
no to that customer request perhaps we

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
should ask the customer to keep it in

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,680
their back pocket because it's not to do

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,640
with our current strategy and those

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,579
are really the core

46
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:09,259
critical activities of the product owner

47
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:12,840
that help us create this lean

48
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,480
directional product backlog that enables

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,379
then the engineering team the developers

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,500
to select the right things and because

51
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,040
it's all understood it's transparent

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,440
it's understood we know what trade-offs

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,000
we're making as a developer we know what

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,860
trade-offs we're making when we choose

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,800
this over that even though this is more

56
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,319
important we know we have to do this

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,140
that first and those are the types of

58
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,319
conversations that we can only have if

59
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,780
we have strong product leadership a

60
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,300
strong product owner on our on our

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,519
product and who's able to communicate

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,599
and express

63
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,599
that strategy and Direction effectively
