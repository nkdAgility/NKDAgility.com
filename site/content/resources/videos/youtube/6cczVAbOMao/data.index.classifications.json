There are no direct mentions of Product Developers, their responsibilities, or the behaviors and mindsets associated with Product Developer accountability in modern frameworks. Indirectly, there are brief references to 'development teams,' but these do not address the cross-functional, collective, or technical aspects at the heart of the Product Developer concept.
