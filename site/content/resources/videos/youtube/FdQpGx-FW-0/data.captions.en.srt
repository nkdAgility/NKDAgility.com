1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,880
one of the harbingers of the agile

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,359
apocalypse is judgment and this normally

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,080
comes in the form of um

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,439
prescriptive ways of doing things this

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,320
this could be organizational

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,960
prescriptive ways of doing things but

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,760
quite often it's um these these top down

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,920
uh

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,600
totalitarian prescriptive phras works

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,640
that tell organizations exactly what to

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
do when to do it what practices to use

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,160
and I understand why organizations and

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
leaders uh love it um they they they

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
don't necessarily know any different

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,320
right they don't they don't know what

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,520
the impact is on the ground of a lot of

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,399
these tools and and and things that

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
people decide you're all going to do it

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,079
this way um they don't understand the

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,519
the whole problem of you're all going to

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
do it this way right that's that's part

22
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,960
fundamentally part of the problem is is

23
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,280
everybody doing the same thing at the

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,439
same time is a factory not a a creative

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,040
collaborative organization right um so

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,720
the the the the these prescriptive ideas

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,960
and whether those prescriptive those

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,720
prescriptive ideas could be scrum I've

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,000
I've worked with organizations uh where

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,600
scrum ends up in the contract Thou shalt

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,759
do scrum or um it ends up as a as an

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,640
organizational man everybody's doing

33
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,439
scrum because they've been told to do

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,799
scrum that's stupid scrum might not be

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,320
the right thing for every team it not

36
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,720
might not be the right thing for every

37
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,880
group in your

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,200
organization agility is not about scrum

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,479
business agility is about figuring out

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,680
how you can

41
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,840
effectively deliver the highest possible

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,520
value to your customers that's what it's

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,799
about everything else is the [Â __Â ]

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,320
you use to try and make that happen Okay

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,399
so one of those tools in your toolbox

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,760
might be scrum another one might be can

47
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,920
ban another one might be scrum and can

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,440
ban there are all sorts of tools that

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,000
you can have in your toolbox that your

50
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,200
teams can choose to use don't prescribe

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,080
stories or story points don't prescribe

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,280
planning poker those things are great

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,280
once or twice maybe for a little bit but

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,480
they're not the long-term solution to

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,000
your problem the long-term solution to

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,760
your problem is not in rules it's not in

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,360
prescription

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,599
rules beget

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,440
judgment right people are going to judge

60
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,319
you for breaking the rules or not

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,280
following the rules and thou shalt

62
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,640
follow here's the Commandments you must

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
follow in our organization Thou shalt do

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,920
scrum right um don't don't don't cover

65
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,760
covet your neighbor agility right your

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,319
other organizations agility don't do

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,840
those things because you will be judged

68
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:11,519
right what we need instead of

69
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,840
judgment is we need principles what are

70
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,640
the principles upon which you would like

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,239
people in your organization to make

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,920
decisions right so you create a set of

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,239
principles for your organization for

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,360
your ways of working be very careful

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,080
that they don't just become rules in

76
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,680
disguise right you should have very few

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,280
principles in your organization this is

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,159
how we're going to do business everybody

79
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,920
should be honest right we want honesty

80
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,799
in what we do we want courage in what we

81
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,360
do um we want openness and transparency

82
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,640
in what it is that we do these are these

83
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:57,079
are principles that can help us make

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,680
better decisions every single person in

85
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,200
your organization is then an effect

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,439
itive decision maker they understand

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,959
they have the access to the data they

88
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,519
have access uh to to the information

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
they need in order to make those

90
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,920
decisions a a great example of of access

91
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,560
to to data is I was talking to a some

92
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,280
product owners from a car company um and

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,759
I asked them so how do you get access to

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,160
the Telemetry that's collected from the

95
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,840
Cars you know not all cars have live

96
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Telemetry right they might have with you

97
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
go in to take your car in for service

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,440
they plug in and download the Telemetry

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,160
right so it's dumped into the system but

100
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
how do how do product owners and things

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,039
get access to that Telemetry well at

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,080
their organization it took six to8

103
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,680
months to get access to the Telemetry

104
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,280
for for whatever request they made

105
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,120
because of all the legal the rules and

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,840
procedures they had to follow in order

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,199
to get there oh but they did tell me a

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,320
story about what happens in Tesla when a

109
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,720
product owner wants access to the

110
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,479
Telemetry data right that's all it takes

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,160
they just have full access open

112
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
transparent within the organization for

113
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,880
all of the product owners have access to

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
all of the data and they can go slice

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,360
and dice it however they like in order

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,120
to help them understand what's going on

117
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,680
what trends are happening what faults

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,479
are happening what do we need to focus

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,479
on in order to make better decisions

120
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,560
right but rules and

121
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,520
procedures get in the way of people

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,000
doing the work rules and procedures were

123
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,600
great in the old school of organizations

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,400
traditional management organizations you

125
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,240
had a largely uneducated Workforce this

126
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,360
is turn of the century Industrial

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,919
Revolution thinking right you've got a

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,639
largely uneducated

129
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,199
Workforce they are not educationally

130
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,919
intellectually capable of making

131
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,759
decisions about the future of your

132
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,960
business therefore we want to push all

133
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,000
of those decisions up the organization

134
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,919
and here's the leadership cater the

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,120
bosses who make all of the decisions and

136
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,800
the people in the ground just do what

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,520
they're told so we're going to plan

138
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,759
their work we're going to separate them

139
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,000
into ability based groups and we're

140
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,759
going to tell them uh and we're going to

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,440
going to have train them only in those

142
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,599
particular abilities that that they're

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,360
going to do right that's how we've ended

144
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,720
up with marketing departments and sales

145
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,360
departments and legal departments and

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Engineering departments and testing

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,080
departments and whatever other buls

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,880
you've got in your organization right

149
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,440
they're slow down the

150
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
ability for you to do business in the

151
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,479
old days it was great right cuz you had

152
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
this group of people you could train

153
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,919
them in that one thing they just do that

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,440
one thing and our our our product goes

155
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,960
through that those Gates Right and those

156
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,400
things happen or it's it's co it's it's

157
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
uh designed and then the analysis

158
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,560
happens and then it's coded and then

159
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,280
it's tested and then it's deployed right

160
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,840
it goes through that that that process

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,759
but today we don't have the luxury of

162
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,039
that amount of time the markets move

163
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,759
much faster and those procedures that

164
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,360
were designed to enshrine the business

165
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,879
processes that we need in order to

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,360
continue to move forward with a largely

167
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,400
uned Workforce are now getting in the

168
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:24,039
way because you have a hugely educated

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,479
massively smart engaged Workforce and

170
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,280
they're looking at your rules and

171
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,000
procedures and going why do I have to do

172
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,759
it that way that's G getting in the way

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,599
of me delivering value for my company

174
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,400
that's getting in the way of me taking

175
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,680
advantage of a business opportunity

176
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,240
that's floating by right you they can't

177
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,800
take advantage of it what happens what

178
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,680
happens to you when you're extremely

179
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,360
frustrated with an

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,759
activity do you continue to like that

181
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,240
activity or does it really annoy you and

182
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,440
maybe you want to leave that activity

183
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,000
that's why your best smartest people

184
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,360
leave because they don't like working in

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,720
those environments you need to move

186
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,159
