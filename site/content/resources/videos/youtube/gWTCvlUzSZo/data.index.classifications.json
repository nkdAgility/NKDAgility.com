It provides practical tips for Scrum Masters about virtual presence and facilitation, but there are no references—direct or indirect—to Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, use, purpose, or any related agile flow metrics. There is no mention of SLE by name, nor is there any exploration of its concepts, metrics, or its role in workflow predictability, cycle times, or Kanban/Scrum theory. While the audience is Scrum Masters (which overlaps with SLE audiences), and the context is agile practices, all the substance is about virtual communication tools, not service level prediction or improvement. The very low scores across all dimensions reflect near-zero connection to the SLE category, and no penalties were needed since there is no contradiction or outdated references—just total thematic misalignment.",
