Scrum Masters love good cameras. Right? If you are working with a team, there's so much more information gained by being able to see the people that you're engaging with. Not just that they're on camera, but that it is good quality, that you can see part of the body so that you can see their body language. You can see whether they're interested, whether they're excited about the topic, whether they couldn't care less. Right? But they all crossed arms. Right? All of these are indications about how we're facilitating, how we're engaging with people. So good cameras with good staging is what Scrum Masters love.
