00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:08,220
scrum Masters love good cameras

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:11,480
right if you are working with a team

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,880
um there's so much more information

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,340
gained by being able to see the people

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,260
that you're engaging with not just that

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,420
they're on camera but that is good

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,820
quality that you can see part of the

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,500
body so that you can see their body

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,939

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,200
less right but they all they all crossed

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,200
arms right all of these are indications

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,840
about how we're facilitating how we're

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
engaging with people so good cameras

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,079
with good staging

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,399
