In the ever-evolving world of Agile, the ability to deliver working software to real users every iteration, including the very first one, is crucial. If your team isn't doing that, you may not be as Agile as you think. The heart of Agile lies in closing feedback loops and fostering tight interactions with customers. In this blog post, we'll dive into why delivering working software early and often is essential for true agility, how it impacts your product's success, and practical advice to help your team excel in this area.

## **Why Delivering Working Software Matters**

### **Closing Feedback Loops**

One of the core principles of Agile is to **close feedback loops** as quickly as possible. Every piece of work your team does before getting the product in front of the customer is based on assumptions. These assumptions need to be validated, and the best way to do that is by delivering working software to real users early and often.

- **Assumptions vs. Reality:** Every decision made during the development process, from feature selection to UI design, is based on assumptions about what the user wants. The longer you go without putting your product in front of real users, the greater the risk that these assumptions are wrong.

- **Tight Interaction with Customers:** By delivering working software regularly, you create opportunities for **tight interaction with your customers**. This means you can gather valuable feedback, make adjustments, and ensure that you're moving in the right direction.

### **Validating Assumptions**

Until your product is in the hands of actual users, everything you've built is just a hypothesis. The sooner you can validate these hypotheses, the better.

- **Real-World Testing:** Early delivery allows your team to test the product in real-world scenarios. This feedback is invaluable and helps you to:
    - Identify what works and what doesn't
    
    - Understand user behavior and preferences
    
    - Make data-driven decisions for future iterations

- **Course Correction:** If the product isn't meeting expectations, you can pivot or adjust your strategy before investing too much time and resources into a flawed approach.

### **Maximizing Value for Stakeholders**

Agile isn't just about delivering software quickly; it's about delivering value. By focusing on delivering working software every iteration, you're ensuring that:

- **Stakeholders See Progress:** Frequent releases demonstrate tangible progress, which builds confidence and trust among stakeholders.

- **Maximizing Work Not Done:** One of the key principles of Agile is to maximize the amount of work not done. This means focusing only on what's essential to deliver value. By delivering small, functional increments of software, you can prioritize the most valuable features and avoid wasting time on unnecessary work.

## **Practical Steps to Deliver Working Software Every Iteration**

Now that we've established the importance of delivering working software, let's explore some practical steps you can take to make this a reality for your team.

### **1\. Start with a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**

One of the best ways to ensure you're delivering working software early is to start with a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**. An MVP is a version of your product with just enough features to satisfy early users and provide feedback for future development.

- **Focus on Core Functionality:** Identify the most critical features that solve the user's problem and deliver them first.

- **Iterate Based on Feedback:** Use the feedback from your MVP to guide subsequent iterations, adding features that users truly need and want.

### **2\. Prioritize User Stories Effectively**

To deliver working software every iteration, you need to be ruthless in prioritizing your user stories.

- **Value-Based Prioritization:** Focus on user stories that deliver the most value to the customer. This could be a feature that solves a significant pain point or an enhancement that improves usability.

- **Small, Incremental Deliveries:** Break down large user stories into smaller, manageable chunks that can be completed within a single iteration. This ensures that you're delivering something usable at the end of each sprint.

### **3\. Involve Stakeholders Early and Often**

Stakeholder involvement is key to ensuring that the software you're delivering meets their expectations and adds value.

- **Regular Demos:** Hold regular sprint demos where you showcase the working software to stakeholders. This keeps them engaged and allows for immediate feedback.

- **Collaborative Prioritization:** Work with stakeholders to prioritize features and user stories based on their needs and business goals.

### **4\. Automate Testing and Deployment**

Automation is your best friend when it comes to delivering working software every iteration. By automating testing and deployment, you can:

- **Ensure Consistency:** Automated tests catch bugs early and ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

- **Speed Up Releases:** Automated deployment pipelines allow you to release new features quickly and with confidence.

### **5\. Embrace a Culture of Continuous Improvement**

Agile is all about continuous improvement. Encourage your team to reflect on each iteration and identify areas for improvement.

- **Retrospectives:** Hold regular retrospectives where the team can discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve in the next iteration.

- **Experiment and Adapt:** Be open to trying new approaches and adapting based on the results. Agile is not a one-size-fits-all framework; it should evolve based on the needs of your team and product.

## **Personal Experience: The Power of Early Feedback**

Let me share a personal example that underscores the importance of delivering working software early. In one of my previous projects, we were working on a new feature that we thought would be a game-changer for our users. We spent several sprints perfecting the feature, making assumptions about what our users wanted.

When we finally released it, the feedback was not what we expected. Users found the feature confusing and didn't see the value we had envisioned. Had we released a minimal version of this feature earlier, we could have gathered this feedback sooner, saving ourselves several sprints of unnecessary work.

This experience reinforced the importance of delivering working software to real users as quickly as possible. The sooner you get feedback, the sooner you can course-correct and ensure you're building something that truly adds value.

## **Conclusion: Delivering Value, One Iteration at a Time**

In Agile, delivering working software every iteration is not just a goalâ€”it's a necessity. It ensures that you're validating your assumptions, gathering feedback, and continuously delivering value to your stakeholders. By focusing on this principle, you can steer your product in the right direction, avoid costly mistakes, and ultimately build something that your users love.

Remember, **Agile is about maximizing value, not just delivering software**. By getting your product in front of real users early and often, you're ensuring that every iteration brings you closer to that goal. ðŸš€ **Start delivering working software every iteration, gather feedback, and watch your product thrive!**
