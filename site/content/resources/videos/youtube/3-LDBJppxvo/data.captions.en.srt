00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,879
our team's delivering working software

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,719
to at least some subset of real users

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,840
every iteration including the first and

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,480
Gathering

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,240
feedback if you're not doing that you're

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,720
probably not very

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,600
agile the purpose of agile is to close

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,599
those feedback loops and get tight

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,599
interaction with our customer everything

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,680
that we do before we actually get our

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,239
product in front of our customer is an

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,360
assumption and we need to validate those

13
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,239
assumptions by getting work in front of

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,960
real users as quickly as possible so

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,039
that we can ensure that as much as

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,360
possible we're going in the right

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,079
direction and not the wrong direction

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,160
maximize the amount of work not done

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,000
maximize the value that you get to your

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,000
stakeholders
