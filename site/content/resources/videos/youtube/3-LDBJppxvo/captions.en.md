Our team's delivering working software to at least some subset of real users every iteration, including the first, and gathering feedback. If you're not doing that, you're probably not very agile. The purpose of agile is to close those feedback loops and get tight interaction with our customer. Everything that we do before we actually get our product in front of our customer is an assumption, and we need to validate those assumptions by getting work in front of real users as quickly as possible so that we can ensure that, as much as possible, we're going in the right direction and not the wrong direction. Maximise the amount of work not done. Maximise the value that you get to your stakeholders.
