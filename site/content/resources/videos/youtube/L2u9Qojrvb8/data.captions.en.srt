1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,839
in

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,320
order to meet the unique needs of all

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:10,920
the different organizations that we work

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,480
with and we've worked with medical

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,920
device organizations military

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:24,680
organizations uh all the way through uh

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:28,279
to to internet startups um and web

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:31,519
organizations doesn't whatever the

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,640
organization the intrinsic philosophies

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,480
of devops are the

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,520
same

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,320
so but how they're solved within the

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,600
context of your organization is

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,039
completely unique it will always be

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,640
unique in every

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,039
organization and although a lot of the

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,960
stories sound the same right there's a

18
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,719
lot of stories that you'll hear about

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,840
devops and devops implementations that

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:01,800
kind of sound the same the the devil's

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,080
in the details right the the the the way

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,920
that it's solved the tools that are used

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,640
the limitations those bring will be

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,479
different in every

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,000
organizations um the the value of

26
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:18,320
engaging with

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,600
us is that we're generally going to be

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,880
focused on on that big picture right

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
that state of devops where are we right

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,560
now where do we want to go and how do we

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:36,880
maintain progress on that that that that

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,960
route so we um do a lot more work at the

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
start and then there's a lot of work

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,600
that has to be done by the people within

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,439
the context that are doing it um and we

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,240
can help keep progress in a particular

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,360
direction we can help engage with them

38
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,399
over the longer ter to to coach them

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,960
around some of these gnarly issues that

40
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,000
they run into right you want to solve a

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,360
particular problem and you don't

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,799
understand how to do it but you need to

43
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,640
try some things and then perhaps get

44
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,360
some advice from somebody who's been

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
doing it a long time and if you don't

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,319
have those skills in your organization

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
sometimes you need to look outside of

48
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,400
your organization for those additional

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,519
skills so because every organization is

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,120
unique every solution is unique and we

51
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,360
can't tell you how to solve your

52
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,519
problems but we can tell you about

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,120
how other people have solved similar

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,000
problems to give you ideas for things to

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
try

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,200
and creating

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,680
this philosophy inside of our

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,159
organization where we're able to take

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,640
little pieces of what works for us

60
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,319
within our context sometimes we need to

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,319
adapt our context but keep moving

62
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,080
forward keep adapting to the needs of

63
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,920
the market market and continually

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,040
increase our capability to deliver

65
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,799
software within our organization is

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,400
where we can help you understand that

67
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,920
direction and how it sits within those

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
devops philosophies
