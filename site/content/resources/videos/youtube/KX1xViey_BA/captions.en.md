So during the Industrial Revolution, the focus really moved from people doing work to systems outputting stuff. I think that was an important move that was valuable. Frederick Winst Taylor said, "In the past, the man was first and in the future, the system must be first." That's kind of still true, but we need to do more; we need to do better. When the system gets in the way of people and collaboration and actually doing stuff, that's when you know that the system is wrong and the system needs fixing. There are no people problems; there are only system problems.
