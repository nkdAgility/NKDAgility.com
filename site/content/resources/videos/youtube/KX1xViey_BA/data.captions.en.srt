1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,520
so during the Industrial Revolution the

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:10,599
focus really

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:14,000
moved from people doing doing work to

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,839
systems outputting stuff and I think

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
that was an important move that was

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,240
valuable uh Frederick winst Taylor said

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,880
in the past the man was first and in the

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,279
future the system must be first and

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,679
that's that's kind of kind of still true

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,599
but we need to do more we need to do

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,600
better

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,079
when the system gets in the way of

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,640
people and collaboration and actually

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,559
doing stuff that's when you know that

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,320
the system is wrong and the system needs

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,680
fixed there are no people problems there

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,680
are only system problems
