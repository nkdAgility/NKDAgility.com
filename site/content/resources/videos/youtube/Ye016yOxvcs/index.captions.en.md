A critical skill to master as an agile consultant is really understanding that you can't possibly understand the customer's context. There's just no way you can do that in the short period that you engage with them. 

So you need to leverage your experience with previous customers and make suggestions that may or may not work within the context of the customer. You're probably going to get it wrong more often than you get it right. You need to keep iterating on that idea and figure out what works well with that customer. 

You'll also find a bunch of stuff that works well everywhere. It's just people. You'll find stuff that works well, but yeah, don't assume you know the customer's context.
