1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,000
a critical skill

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,260
um to master as an agile consultant is

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,580
really understanding that you can't

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,160
possibly understand the customer's

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,900
context there's just no way you can do

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
that in the short period that you engage

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:23,119
with them and so you need to leverage

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,220
your experience with previous customers

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,740
and make suggestions

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,060
right that may or may not work within

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,260
the context of the customer and you're

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,660
probably going to get it wrong more

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,860
often than you get it right you need to

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,480
keep iterating on that on that idea and

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,980
figure out what's what works well with

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,379
that customer you'll also find a bunch

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,960
of stuff that work well everywhere right

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,480
it's just people you'll find stuff that

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,500
work well but yeah don't assume you know

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,500
the customer's context
