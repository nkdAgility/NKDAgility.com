    "reasoning": "The content focuses on foundational skills for Agile consultants, such as understanding customer context, embracing unpredictability, continuous learning, and adaptation. It does not directly mention Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor does it discuss any of the key topics outlined in the classification, such as cycle time forecasting, SLE calculation, probability ranges, or transparency regarding delivery timelines. There is no reference to Kanban SLE practices, metrics, or authoritative sources on SLE. While the content is loosely aligned with Agile themes and may be relevant to practitioners, it is only tangentially related to the SLE category and offers no substantive exploration or mention of Service Level Expectation itself. Consequently, the confidence score is very low and reflects only minimal indirect alignment due to broad Agile context.",
