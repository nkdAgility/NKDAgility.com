1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,920
one of the biggest issues with uh

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,399
migrating as your devops up to the cloud

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,760
is probably that you're only going to do

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,679
it once and because you're only going to

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,519
do it once um you're unlikely to have

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,800
the skills already in existence in house

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,480
uh to be able to do that migration and

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,800
it probably doesn't make sense to build

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,680
those build and maintain those skills in

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,560
house because it's something you're

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,480
probably only going to do once um so for

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,879
B

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,320
Microsoft's um um uh database migration

14
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,680
depending on the size of your database

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,239
it can get quite

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,719
complicated um doesn't quite hit complex

17
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,239
but when you start um running a lot of

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,559
the validation tools against it to make

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,879
sure that your environment is compliant

20
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:58,559
for moving up to Azure devops is when

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,320
you get a lot of wacky stuff um that

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,079
is there's rabbit holes you need to go

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,040
into to understand a lot of that stuff

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:10,119
because um there are things that perhaps

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,479
could have happened to your system if

26
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:17,520
for example in the past uh somebody had

27
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:20,000
a a particular version installed um and

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,439
Microsoft made a a mess up right and

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,079
they released a patch and

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,400
between the install and the patch um

31
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,240
somebody made the change that the patch

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,079
is supposed to fix but it didn't quite

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,040
fix the actual data then um you you're

34
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,720
left with a data and a little bit of a

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,479
inconsistent format and what you

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,680
normally need to do is run some commands

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
against the system um and understanding

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,399
those commands what they're actually

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,119
doing um can be can be quite a deep

40
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,039
Rabbit Hole to get into um but

41
00:01:52,119 --> 00:02:00,079
ultimately um we've done hundreds of

42
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:02,840
migrations I've been working with aure

43
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,360
Ops since it was Visual Studio team

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,039
system and it launched back in 2005

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,520
2006 uh so i' been working with it for a

46
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,879
long time and I built the tools uh that

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,760
Microsoft recommend to do um the the

48
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,519
peace more peace bu migration like I

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,800
want to move one team I want to merge

50
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,400
projects I want to split projects uh

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,480
those types of migrations which that's a

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,360
lot even more deeper skills necessary to

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,599
be able to run that tool because it's

54
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
it's

55
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,560
um really really really flexible when

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
you have things that are really really

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,239
really flexible that increases the

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,480
complexity and the configurability of

59
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,239
that thing um so you you you need

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,800
somebody to spend a lot of time figuring

61
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,720
that out we we have that knowledge and

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,239
expertise because we built the Tool uh

63
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,879
so if you're going to

64
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,080
do one migration or a few migrations

65
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,519
over a small period of time time you're

66
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,640
probably better just hiring somebody to

67
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,400
do that work if you're going to do a

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,799
whole bunch of migrations over a long

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,400
period of time um I do also work with

70
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,799
customers where we we train people

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
within the organization to use the tools

72
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,879
and then we help them uh uh run the

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,120
tools on a continuous basis um help with

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,319
support because you always run into

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,760
crazy things that are specific to you as

76
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,239
a customer those data shapes that I

77
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,120
mentioned perhaps in the midsts of time

78
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,159
of your your TFS environment um your

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,519
environment the database was originally

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
controlled under the control of the

81
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,360
developers right because uh it's a

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,560
developer tool so maybe maybe operations

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,319
didn't really own it and the developers

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,720
decided to install TFS 2013 beta 1 uh

85
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,640
which was supported by Microsoft but can

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,480
cause lots of weird data things um and

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,280
then it's on track it's been handed over

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,480
to operations

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,400
uh but there's some weird ID

90
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,599
idiosyncrasies in there so bringing in

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,959
expertise for for those types of things

92
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,159
whether it's for training the people

93
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,720
that you have that you want to do

94
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,120
long-term lots of different migrations

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,440
or if you just want somebody to take it

96
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,199
off your hands and do it for you um

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,759
that's ultimately what we're here for

98
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,759
you don't need the expertise in house
