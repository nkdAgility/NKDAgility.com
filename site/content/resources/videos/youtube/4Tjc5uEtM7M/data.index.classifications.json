While internal empowerment is touched on (e.g., training teams), this is not developed within the philosophical or systemic agency framework of Agentic Engineering. Core discussion revolves around migration tactics and expert consultancy, not the deliberate design of work systems or the maximization of human/AI agency as described in Agentic Engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is focused on practical Azure DevOps migration with emphasis on technical complexity and external expertise, offering little conceptual or explicit connection to Agentic Engineering themes of agency, systemic practices, or AI integration.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on best practices, complexities, and the need for expertise in migrating to Azure DevOps. It discusses tool use and migration strategy but never mentions autonomous AI agents, agency, contextual intelligence, or agentic principles. There is no reference to human-AI teaming, modern agentic delivery practices, or AI-powered automation. The intent is instructive but entirely within the scope of traditional migration and DevOps skill transfer, not Agentic Software Delivery. Audience (technical practitioners) partially overlaps, but only tangentially.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content addresses Azure DevOps migration using traditional methods and expert consultancy. It lacks any discussion of autonomous AI agents, agentic delivery, or the integration of contextual intelligence—so only fits the category in the broadest technical sense.",
