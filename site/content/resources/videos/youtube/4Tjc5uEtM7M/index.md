Migrating to Azure DevOps can feel like a daunting task, especially when you consider that for many organisations, it’s a one-time event. This singularity often means that the necessary skills for a successful migration may not exist in-house. From my experience, it rarely makes sense to build and maintain these skills internally, particularly when the migration is something you’re likely to do just once.

### The Complexity of Database Migration

When it comes to migrating Microsoft’s databases, the complexity can vary significantly based on the size of your database. While it may not reach the level of complexity that some might expect, the real challenges often arise during the validation phase. Running compliance checks against your environment can reveal unexpected issues. 

I’ve seen it time and again: you might encounter peculiarities that require delving into the depths of your system. For instance, consider a scenario where a specific version of software was installed, and a patch was released that didn’t quite resolve the underlying data issues. This can leave your data in a somewhat inconsistent state, which is far from ideal.

### Navigating the Rabbit Holes

To address these inconsistencies, you typically need to execute a series of commands against your system. Understanding these commands and their implications can lead you down a rabbit hole of complexity. Having been involved in hundreds of migrations since the days of Visual Studio Team System, I can attest to the intricacies involved. 

I’ve developed tools that Microsoft recommends for various migration scenarios—whether it’s moving a single team, merging projects, or splitting them apart. Each of these tasks requires a nuanced understanding of the tools and processes involved, which can be quite intricate.

### The Need for Expertise

The flexibility of Azure DevOps is both a blessing and a curse. While it allows for a high degree of customisation, it also increases the complexity of the migration process. This is where having someone with the right expertise becomes invaluable. 

If your organisation is planning to undertake just one or a few migrations, I strongly recommend hiring an expert to manage the process. However, if you foresee a series of migrations over an extended period, I often work with clients to train their internal teams. This approach empowers them to use the tools effectively while we provide ongoing support.

### Addressing Unique Challenges

Every organisation has its own unique challenges. For example, in some cases, the database may have been primarily managed by developers, leading to a situation where operations teams are handed over a system with peculiarities—like a beta version of TFS that was supported but introduced unexpected data issues. 

In these instances, bringing in external expertise can be crucial. Whether you need training for your team or prefer to have someone handle the migration entirely, that’s where we come in. You don’t need to have all the expertise in-house; it’s about leveraging the right resources to ensure a smooth transition.

### Conclusion

In summary, migrating to Azure DevOps is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning and execution. Whether you choose to bring in external experts or train your internal teams, the key is to ensure that you have the right knowledge and support in place. With the right approach, you can navigate the complexities of migration and set your organisation up for success in the cloud.
