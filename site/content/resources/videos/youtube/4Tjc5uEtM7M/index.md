# DevOps Migration. Lack of Expertise

Migrating to Azure DevOps can be a one-time, complex project that often requires specialized expertise. In this video, I discuss why itâ€™s typically better to bring in experienced professionals for your migration rather than trying to build skills in-house. Migration is often a deep, technical process, especially when handling data inconsistencies or navigating older TFS setups with unique quirks.

With years of experience in DevOps and as the creator of Microsoftâ€™s recommended migration tools, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how expertise can make or break a smooth migration. For organizations planning multiple migrations, I also offer training and support for in-house teams, ensuring theyâ€™re equipped to handle ongoing transitions.
