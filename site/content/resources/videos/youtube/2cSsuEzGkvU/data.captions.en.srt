1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:07,359
bringing um modesty and respect for

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,200
others into the conversation in agility

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,920
is going to help you build trust right

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,559
build those empathetic relationships

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,279
both within the team within the

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:23,599
organization and Leadership and

00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:26,599
outwardly towards customers don't make

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:30,359
assumptions right that's the the the key

you need somebody else to to to look in

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,079
on it to to point it out um but then do

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,800
you listen to those people do you

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,760
realize that perhaps other people's

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,440
perceptions um are are are are important

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,440
