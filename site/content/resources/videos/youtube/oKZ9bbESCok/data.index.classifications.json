    "reasoning": "The content critiques say-do and vanity metrics, urging a focus on outcomes over outputs, measurement of value delivered, transparency, and continuous improvement—all traits conceptually adjacent to OKR philosophy, especially the shift towards outcomes and value. However, at no point does it mention OKRs, John Doerr, or their foundational principles. There is no explicit reference to objectives, key results, or the OKR goal-setting framework, nor discussion of strategic alignment, measurement cadence, or the four superpowers. The substance focuses on common Agile/DevOps measurement pitfalls and best practices, which overlap with but are not uniquely tied to OKRs. The target audience (Agile/DevOps practitioners and leaders) somewhat overlaps, but the absence of direct OKR references, implementation discussion, or even passing mention, keeps all scores low. No penalties apply—the content is modern, constructive, and neutral in tone.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While this post supports outcome-driven measurement and cultural transparency—ideas compatible with OKRs—it never actually references OKRs, objectives, key results, or John Doerr's framework. Its themes align in spirit but not in explicit content, so fit with the OKR category is incidental and weak.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions are nearly absent—the term 'Agentic Engineering' is never referenced, nor are its signature concepts named directly. The post does align conceptually by critiquing rigid, output-driven practices in favor of outcome-orientation, transparency, and psychological safety, all indirectly resonant with agentic principles. However, it focuses more on agile metrics and psychological safety than on explicit maximisation of human/AI agency, deliberative engineering design, ethical AI, or systemic observability. Its exploration of empowerment and value-delivery runs parallel to agentic goals but lacks a direct or deep engineering-craft context (e.g., DevOps-infused craft, automation as autonomy, AI collaboration frameworks). The intent and audience both lean toward agile practitioners and leaders concerned with team metrics rather than those designing for explicit agency. The signal is strong and concise regarding its focused critique, but agentic engineering remains implicit rather than explicit.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the content focuses on Agile pitfalls and the importance of outcomes, transparency, and psychological safety—elements tangentially related to Agentic Engineering—it does not explicitly engage with the core themes or depth of the category. Alignment is moderate and mostly indirect.",
