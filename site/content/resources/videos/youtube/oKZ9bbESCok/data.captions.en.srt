1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,520
one of the agile practices that puts us

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:11,559
clearly and explicitly in the category

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,799
of agile banditry is using say do

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,519
metrics that's metrics where you're

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,600
looking at what people say they were

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:25,080
going to do and then what they actually

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:27,720
did a great example of that is uh um oh

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,560
oh I guess my favorite example is from

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,800
an organization that I worked with many

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,800
years ago

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,600
um that the head of pmo brought me into

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,239
his office to show me uh some of the

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,079
metrics that they presented up to

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,840
leadership in the organization and for

15
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,079
each of the projects uh this was many

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,760
years ago each of the projects that they

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,120
had underway I think there were five

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,960
projects they had underway um they they

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,440
had a original estimate versus actual

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
that's the quintessential s do original

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,800
estimate and actuals uh uh for for each

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,040
of the projects and they were in the

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,759
thousands of hours right like 5,000

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,600
hours um and something I noticed right

25
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,840
away when he showed me this this this

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,360
presentation it was a presentation to to

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,360
to show the leadership was that of the

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,439
five projects all of them were within

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,759
20% but if you know your bcks and you

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,320
know your statistics you'll probably

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,280
know from the uh chaos report of the

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,720
Standish group um that

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
65% of the features that we think we're

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,320
going to build change during the life of

35
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,000
the the the the project so how could it

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,320
possibly be only a 20% deviation between

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
the amount of time we think it's going

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,799
to take and the amount of time actually

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,320
going to take so that was my first clue

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,000
that something was up my second clue was

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
that uh uh three of the projects were

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,360
within

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,719
15% two of them were within 10% and then

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,759
I noticed that one project that said

45
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,480
5,232 hours original estimate

46
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,000
5,232 hours

47
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,959
actuals and I just turned the graph

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,160
around pointed at that one and said but

49
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,239
this is

50
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,519
BS how how could you possibly have these

51
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,760
numbers be the same and he said well

52
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,000
right you know there's something bad

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,040
coming when somebody does that that well

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,159
in La last year last year yearly budgets

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,840
whole other problem last year we uh

56
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,280
created this report uh with with what

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,560
what happened and we gave it to

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
leadership and they had a tantrum and

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,120
threw their toys out the prom and

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,159
shouted at us um and made our lives a

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,760
misery so this year we made a change to

62
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:01,120
the system and we allowed project

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,360
managers to make a change request to

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,319
their original estimate and that project

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,920
manager just got his change request in

66
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,280
just before we completed the report

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,959
before the deadline uh so the original

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,239
estimate had been changed more than once

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,840
in order to get the graphs to look like

70
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,959
they did so they're going to go and

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
present this to leadership and

72
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,519
Leadership is potentially going to make

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,920
decisions on what they fund what they

74
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,599
don't fund based on this type of data

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,040
this data that is complete Fiction it's

76
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:41,319
just complete fiction so you don't want

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,640
that in organizations if you have a

78
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,640
monitor s do uh metrics there are many

79
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
other types of s do metrics but the most

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,400
common one is original estimate and

81
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,200
actuals right um monitoring s do metrics

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,400
reduces psychological safety right that

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,720
that pmo the pmo of a big organization

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,319
didn't feel safe and enough to show

85
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,879
leadership the real data they had to

86
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,959
create vanity metrics in order to make

87
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,519
them happy um we tend to focus on output

88
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
rather than outcome right well you said

89
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,880
you were going to deliver 10 things but

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,840
you only actually delivered nine things

91
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,080
you suck right whereas an actual fact we

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,720
delivered nine of the most valuable

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,320
things wasn't that better if we

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,919
delivered nine things that were more

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,160
valuable than the 10 things that were

96
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,960
asked for

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,680
right or you delivered zero of the

98
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:41,440
things we asked I I I remember um being

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,320
at a at a MVP Summit AT Microsoft um

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,800
where they they they invited us to come

101
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,320
and talk about the product and the year

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,800
before we' done a whole bunch of stats

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,199
and uh learnings on what are the most

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,320
valuable features that we as MVPs

105
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,520
believe as your devops needs as a

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,240
product I think it was TFS service at

107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,720
the time what what are the cool features

108
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,120
we need we did days like five days of

109
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,000
figuring out what that was and came up

110
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,320
with a list of here's the top five

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,720
things that we believe all of our

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,800
customers need in the product and the

113
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,479
very first thing uh uh uh uh the next

114
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,199
year when Brian Harry uh got up to do

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:22,400
his key you know Keynotes entry starting

116
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,039
presentation to kick the the next Summit

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
off he said here's a list of the five

118
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,199
things that you said were the best

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,000
things we could build and I'll tell you

120
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,919
now we've built none of them here's what

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
we did build instead of building the

122
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,440
things that we thought were the most

123
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,479
valuable he went off and totally blew

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,960
our socks off with all the things he did

125
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,960
build that were much more valuable to

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,479
our

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,280
customers if we'd held them to the say

128
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
do

129
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,440
metric they delivered nothing that we

130
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,520
asked for and that is absolutely not the

131
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,759
case so don't focus on output over

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,120
outcome you want to be focusing on the

133
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:08,319
outcomes what it is you're trying to

134
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,080
achieve um and it that over

135
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,400
emphasis that comes from it on

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,720
estimation is is key to that negative

137
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
feeling that people have uh when when

138
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,759
you monitor them with s metrics just

139
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,400
just stop doing se s metrics uh don't be

140
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:29,960
a bandit um and give up on that agile

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,840
banditry of s do metrics

142
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,560
