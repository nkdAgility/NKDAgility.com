Oh hi, my name is Martin Hinshelwood, and I’m the owner of Naked Agility. As a professional Scrum trainer with Scrum.org and a Microsoft MVP, I’ve been delivering software for about 20 years and working in organisational change for over a decade. Today, I want to share some insights on the inevitability of change, a topic that resonates deeply with my experiences in various markets, particularly in Ghana and Nigeria.

### The Myth of Transformation

First and foremost, let’s address a common misconception: there’s really no such thing as an “agile transformation,” “digital transformation,” or “DevOps transformation.” You can’t buy agility, nor can you simply install it. There are no end states or optimal outcomes, only adequate practices tailored to the situation at hand. 

- **Agility is a Journey**: It’s about nurturing and evolving your organisation, not about reaching a final destination. Think of it as a garden; you must grow, prune, and adapt as you go along.

### Evolution vs. Transformation

To illustrate this, consider the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly. It has a clear beginning and end, but evolution is a continuous process of experimentation. Successful experiments thrive, while the unsuccessful ones fade away. This is the reality for organisations today.

- **Historical Context**: In the past, business niches evolved slowly. Industries like coal and oil existed for decades, allowing companies to grow and dominate their markets. Today, however, niches change at an unprecedented pace, largely due to the rapid flow of information facilitated by the internet.

### The Need for Speed

The speed of change is accelerating. Organisations often only adapt when faced with existential threats. This “fight or flight” response can be detrimental. Reflect on whether your organisation could have survived the challenges posed by COVID-19 two decades ago. 

- **Technological Evolution**: Twenty years ago, the average internet speed was a mere 56 kilobits per second. Video conferencing was a distant dream. Fast forward to today, and those organisations that embraced cloud technologies have thrived, while others struggled.

### Embracing Change

I often hear the phrase, “If it isn’t broke, don’t fix it.” In today’s fast-paced world, I’d argue that this mindset is outdated. Instead, we should adopt the philosophy: “If it isn’t broken, you’re not pushing change fast enough.” 

- **Continuous Experimentation**: Embrace failure as part of the learning process. Success comes from a series of experiments conducted at a sustainable pace, allowing you to seize business opportunities as they arise.

### The Legacy of Industrial Management

Many management practices we see today were developed during the industrial revolution, a time characterised by low change. These practices are no longer fit for purpose in our rapidly evolving world. 

- **The Cobblers of Old**: Before the industrial revolution, craftsmen like cobblers had a direct relationship with their customers. They understood their needs and took pride in their work. This sense of purpose and mastery is often lost in today’s factory-like environments.

### The Shift in Work Dynamics

The industrial revolution mechanised the workforce, turning skilled workers into replaceable cogs in a machine. This shift led to a disconnect between workers and their purpose. 

- **The Consequences**: Traditional management practices, rooted in mistrust, have perpetuated a culture where employees are seen as liabilities rather than assets. This is a fundamental flaw in our approach to management.

### Rethinking Management Practices

As we move forward, we must dismantle the bureaucratic processes that stifle creativity and innovation. 

- **The Role of Leadership**: Leaders must take accountability for the changes within their organisations. It’s not about adopting a new set of practices; it’s about evolving your organisation organically and iteratively.

### Conclusion: The Inevitable Change

In conclusion, the inevitability of change is a reality we must embrace. As leaders, you need to define your vision and the steps to achieve it. Experimentation is key; you won’t know what works until you try. 

- **Final Thoughts**: Let’s not get trapped in a cycle of replacing one bureaucratic process with another. Instead, let’s evolve our organisations to thrive in a world of constant change.
