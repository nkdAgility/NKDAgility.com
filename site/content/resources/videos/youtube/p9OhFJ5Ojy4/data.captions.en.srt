with scrum.org um i'm a microsoft

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
mvp and i've been delivering software

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,080
for about 20 years and working in

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,960
organizational change for more than 10

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,119
years

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,720
i'd like to thank akaditi and nana for

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,400
the opportunity to talk

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,399
to you about the inevitability of change

12

i speak uh often in ghana um i

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,640

akaditi

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,440
um i'm was looking forward to being

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,480
in nigeria uh but obviously uh that

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,840
is not the case um but this is

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
second best for sure getting to to meet

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,480
all of you and interact

um please feel free to ask any questions

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,040
in the chat and i'll hopefully have time

to answer them all

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
at the end hopefully akidity will

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,119
moderate those

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,400
uh for me um failing that

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,280
you can ask me any questions on uh

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
twitter as well um and obviously

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
linkedin

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
i have a whole bunch of webcasts over on

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
naked agility.tv

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,920
that i've recorded previously i'm sure

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,960
uh akadetti are going to be publishing

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,360
all of their uh recordings uh later

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,400
and i'll be providing a link to the

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
presentation

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
in the presentation at the end of the

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,240
presentation

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
the final slide has a has a link and a

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,000
qr code

43
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
to get you access to the presentation

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,280
something that i've been considering for

45
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
quite a while

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,600
is that there's really no such thing

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
as an agile transformation a digital

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,840
transformation

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,920
devops transformation or any other

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
transformation in business that you can

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,120
think of or that you might have been

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,319
sold

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,599
you can't you can't buy agility and you

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,480
certainly can't

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,120
install it there's no end states no

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
optimal

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
outcome and certainly no best practices

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,319
only adequate practices for the

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,760
situation at hand

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,040
so instead you have to grow

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,519
and nurture and prune agility as it

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,879
grows

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,680
inside your organization and eventually

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,000
you too will be able to take advantage

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
of

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,760
business opportunities as they arise

67
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
in whatever changing marketplace that

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,000
you're in

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
this is continuous change it's an

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
evolution

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
not a transformation

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,080
it's easy to see uh the the

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,360
uh uh if you think of the evolution

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,319
uh sorry the transformation of a

75
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
caterpillar

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,000
that transforms into a butterfly

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,959
it has a beginning state and it has an

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,599
end state

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,640
and in between it has a transformational

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
state

81
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
and it starts in one place and it

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,080
finishes at the end

83
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,280
but evolution is a constant

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,480
and continuous set of experiments the

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
successful

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,720
experiments succeed and do well in a

87
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,720
particular niche

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,599
the unsuccessful ones fail and die

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
the same is true with companies and

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,720
organizations

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
in the past the ebb and flow of niches

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,239
in the business world

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,560
was was very slow uh niches

94
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,640
that we could take advantage of existed

95
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
for a long period of time

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
look at the length of time that the coal

97
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,760
industry has been around

98
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,799
or the oil industry and there are

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,280
many of those types of niches that were

100
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,640
there for a long long time

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
tens if not hundreds of years

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
and we could grow our organization to

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
fit into that

104
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,400
niche slowly and once we owned that

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
niche

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
it was very hard for competitors to come

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,199
in

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,479
and disrupt our abilities we

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,160
owned that space today

110
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,440
however niches grow and change

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,320
much faster than ever before

112
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,880
my belief is that it's due to the the

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
new

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,840
flow of information the internet

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,320
has made things a lot faster we find out

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,080
things

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,479
quicker we have a a

118
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
feeling that we need to do something

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
with this

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,080
information much more quickly

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,520
um and that that as it gets faster

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,840
we need to react facts faster and thus

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,600
a virtuous cycle of increasing change

124
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,880
perpetuates and however for now

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
organizations

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,600
only change when they are in danger

127
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
fight or flight kicks in and they either

128
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,280
adapt to the changing environment

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,639
or maybe they die that's the way it's

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,199
kind of always been

131
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,600
but very very slowly ask yourself

132
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
if your organization or organizations

133
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,639
you can

134
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,720
you can think of that you interact with

135
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,639
would have survived

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,520
covet 19 20 years ago

137
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,800
think of the technology that we had 20

138
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,160
years ago

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,280
the the the average worldwide internet

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
connection speed

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,759
20 years ago it was 56 kilobits per

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,600
second

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
you wouldn't have been able to do video

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
conferencing you

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,479
we wouldn't have been able to run this

146
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
conference

147
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,479
what about 10 years ago was the

148
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,319
technology even there 10 years ago

149
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,199
to solve some of these problems and

150
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,039
allow many organizations

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,680
to continue with very little disruption

152
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,960
the big tech organizations that were

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
mentioned earlier like

154
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,479
google and microsoft um

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
have had very little disruption any

156
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,759
organization

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
that has people sitting in an office

158
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
doing work

159
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,639
shouldn't need to be disrupted in the

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
way they potentially were

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,199
because they weren't relying or they

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,680
didn't have the new technologies

163
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
that have become available in the last

164
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,840
20 years

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
if you did have those technologies but

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
you

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,880
put them in maybe five ten years ago

168
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,360
you probably rely on vpn

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,919
so suddenly instead of having a few

170
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,240
employees connecting into your network

171
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,120
to then access everything

172
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,160
you had all of your employees trying to

173
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
connect in

174
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,520
and access everything and most

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,440
organizations vpns couldn't cope

176
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
with that number of users they you know

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,880
expect a small number of users to be

178
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
connected to any one time

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,080
rather than everybody in the company

180
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,680
connected all day

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,280
but if you had already adopted

182
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,319
many of those cloud technologies that

183
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
are available

184
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,919
like the one we're using now at

185
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,560
microsoft teams

186
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
it is all set up in the cloud all of you

187
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,080
are connecting

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,319
not into academies offices but directly

189
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
to microsoft servers in the cloud in

190
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,919
order to

191
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,360
uh take advantage of all of your

192
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,479
internet connections

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,039
rather than be restricted by one single

194
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,039
point of

195
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,919
failure and how many

196
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,319
of those organizations made that change

197
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,400
so if you've been able to utilize

198
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
the cloud if you've already moved your

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,960
services online

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,280
then there was very little disruption

201
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,400
employees working from home

202
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,160
probably got faster connections

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
than the connections they got on the in

204
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
the office because they're using their

205
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,360
home connection that they own the whole

206
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,120
bandwidth

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,039
rather than the office bandwidth that

208
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
they're sharing with all of their

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,759
colleagues

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,520
if you had changed if you

211
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,879
had adopted new things as they became

212
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
available

213
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
i often hear the phrase if it isn't

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,279
broke

215
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,479
don't fix it but i think that

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,640
is a very outmoded and old

217
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,920
phrase for today today i would much

218
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,320
prefer to hear if it isn't broken you're

219
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
not

220
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,760
pushing change fast enough you're not

221
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,839
trying new things you're not

222
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,080
experimenting

223
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,120
evolution is about embracing

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,640
failure and learning from it

225
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,640
it's okay to fail we do it all the time

226
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
but if we learn from it we pick

227
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,160
ourselves back up

228
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
and figure out how to do things a little

229
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,320
bit better

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,959
because success is the result of

231
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
continuous

232
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,279
experimentation at a sustainable pace

233
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,720
that enables you to take advantage

234
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,760
of whatever business opportunities

235
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,480
occur as they arise this

236
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
is the inevitability of change

237
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,600
our current way of working the

238
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:43,120
management practices that i

239
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
and my colleagues see as prevalent in

240
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
the world

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
i'm not going to say that everybody is

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
using these management practices

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
but the vast majority of people are

244
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,560
still using

245
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,279
management practices that were developed

246
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,920
130 years ago during the industrial

247
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,920
revolution

248
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,920
and they were created in an environment

249
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,360
of very

250
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,680
low change things weren't moving

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
fast at the time we didn't have the

252
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
communication levels

253
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,880
that we have now and those practices

254
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,000
were able to support those systems of

255
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,040
the time

256
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,640
but they're no longer able to keep up

257
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,959
with the constant evolution of now

258
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,959
prior to the industrial revolution

259
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,040
manufacturing took place

260
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:38,320
at or near your home in small workshops

261
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,760
you might imagine a cobbler making

262
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
shoes in a village his compensation came

263
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,519
through

264
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,959
earned value that was based on how well

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,240
he made the shoes

266
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,000
and how uh uh how

267
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
well they fitted the needs of the

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,320
customer he

269
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,279
understood who his customer was you're

270
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,839
muted

271
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,839
martin i'm muted ah

272
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,240
so again uh please don't use the mute

273
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,200
all button otherwise you will mute the

274
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,760
speaker

275
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,959
uh if you look through the list of

276
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
participants

277
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,279
you will see people flashing uh that are

278
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,839
making a lot of noise

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,120
and you can click on them and mute them

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
individually

281
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,399
uh where did i get to can you help me

282
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
you know

283
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,160
we didn't mute you maybe she couldn't

284
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
hear you but we could hear you

285
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,200
sorry oh okay perfect

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
ah now i've forgotten where i was we

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,920
were talking about the cobbler in the

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,240
village weren't we

289
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,760
uh because he understood who his

290
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,360
customers well he probably

291
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,560
engaged with them a lot more often

292
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,320
than we engage with our customers he

293
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
probably met with them for a drink in

294
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,639
the pub

295
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,399
uh the the local policeman the farmer

296
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
they're gonna drink and they're going to

297
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
have this person right next to them who

298
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
made

299
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,399
the shoes on their feet that they walk

300
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,320
about in every day and they can complain

301
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,880
they can say what you liked and what

302
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,399
they didn't it's a very

303
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,240
powerful way to work and there was

304
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,160
purpose to the his work he could see

305
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
and engage with his customer and get

306
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,399
that purpose

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,279
and because he had that purpose it also

308
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,800
enabled

309
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,000
mastery think about the the master

310
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,040
and apprentice system that operated

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,320
at that time and you would have

312
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,519
uh the the the not the great wealth of

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,600
knowledge uh that the long beard had

314
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,839
created over many years of being a

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,440
cobbler and they would pass it on

316
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,000
to the next person down the line whether

317
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,279
that

318
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
is uh just

319
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,639
out of interest i have a lot of

320
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
background noise here is it okay for you

321
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,040
we can't hear it awesome i'm using that

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,040
crisper thing uh so it's deleting i i

323
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,839
all i hear is a lawnmower outside my

324
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,120
window

325
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,279
but i'm glad you can't hear it so that

326
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,200
mastery that master and apprentice

327
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
system passing knowledge down through

328
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
the generations

329
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,959
uh people chose uh to work hard

330
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,160
and well in order to get better at what

331
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,279
they did

332
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,600
so that that getting better at what they

333
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
did

334
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
becoming a master either manifested

335
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,040
itself

336
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
as increased wealth or greater time to

337
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,480
pursue other

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,079
interests that they have uh whether that

339
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,800
be drinking in the pub or

340
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,800
whatever other things they like doing

341
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:50,320
so during the industrial revolution

342
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,680
at big change happened in the way we

343
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,519
work and the way we do things

344
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,519
the industrial revolution changed the

345
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,720
world forever we've already had

346
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,279
a show talk talking about it earlier we

347
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
need to

348
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,839
we needed to scale up really quickly but

349
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
technology of the time

350
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,600
couldn't build the quantity of goods

351
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,639
required

352
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,600
without human help we needed to

353
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,279
mechanize the workforce we turned

354
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,320
people's jobs

355
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,120
into robotic jobs workers

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,079
no longer had a purpose beyond the

357
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
paycheck

358
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,680
and neither understood the value the

359
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
customers

360
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,600
and didn't have any mastery people

361
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,199
became replaceable

362
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,440
cogs in a machine think about that

363
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,959
modern even today management practice

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,680
where it's okay we don't need to

365
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,959
help and support our workers because if

366
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,880
somebody quits

367
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,880
there's 10 people waiting at the door

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,160
that can go do that job

369
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,320
that's for unskilled labor if you have

370
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,839
somebody who's solving problems with

371
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,160
their brain

372
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,279
then that's not good enough you're

373
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,760
losing a lot more than just an

374
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
uh an individual you're losing a lot

375
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,240
more

376
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,959
than just a cog in the system

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,920
so i would say what's the difference

378
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,079
between

379
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,839
these two pictures on the left we have

380
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,600
the master passing

381
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,639
a wealth of knowledge on to the

382
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,440
apprentice they understand the whole

383
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,519
context of the product they're building

384
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,279
they understand who their customer is

385
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,199
and how they're using the product

386
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,360
what their job is what they do day to

387
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,680
day and the customer has direct

388
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,040
access to the people that are making the

389
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
product

390
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,800
and on the right we have a bunch of

391
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,320
factory workers

392
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,759
making something

393
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
i actually don't know what they're

394
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,880
making i'm pretty sure

395
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,000
you would not be able to figure out what

396
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,040
they're making

397
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,959
it's a round thing with some pins in it

398
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,399
and there's lots of people doing the

399
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,680
same thing

400
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,800
do they even know what it's for do they

401
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,160
even care does that even matter

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,160
maybe it doesn't and the

403
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,320
thing that happens when you're doing

404
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,560
that kind of mind-numbing work

405
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,000
the example i always use is if you you

406
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,079
might have read a book called

407
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,199
charlie in the chocolate factory by road

408
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,560
al uh

409
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,079
in that book charlie's dad lost his job

410
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,199
at a factory

411
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,720
uh and his job was screwing the top on

412
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,120
toothpaste bottles

413
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
that was his job day in and day out and

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,160
he was replaced by a robot

415
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,360
he's just a replaceable [Â __Â ] he's a

416
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,720
machine

417
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,720
waiting for me for uh robots to happen

418
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,320
so because people were disengaging

419
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,519
uh from the process uh

420
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,360
there's this idea and they had a name

421
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,480
for it at the time it was called

422
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,759
it's soldiering which is not the

423
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,039
soldiering that we know today but

424
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,520
it was this idea of somebody working

425
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,439
more

426
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,880
slowly than their capacity they're

427
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,679
deliberately

428
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
working more slowly than their capacity

429
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,520
uh

430
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,959
you might use the phrase to loaf or

431
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,720
uh that depends on uh uh your cultural

432
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,839
background whether those words

433
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,919
have meaning uh but uh that's just to

434
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,000
work more slowly than one's capacity to

435
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,039
lay about not doing much try and avoid

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
doing the work

437
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,600
going in hiding around the corner from

438
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,160
where the supervisor is because you

439
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
want to have a cheeky extra cigarette

440
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
break

441
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,120
whatever those things are loafing and

442
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,720
malingering

443
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,000
so i want you to imagine that you

444
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,720
are a management consultant

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,720
around at the time of the

446
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,000
1890s now i have

447
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,600
a link that i'm going to put in the

448
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,600
chat which might uh make this

449
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
a little bit easier so i'm going to put

450
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,480
it in the chat

451
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,480
can everybody see my slide oh yes you

452
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
can see my slides

453
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,600
so one person was saying they can't see

454
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,160
my slides they i they're

455
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
they are displaying uh so it might be a

456
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
computer

457
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,559
network issue i've put a link in the

458
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
chat

459
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,880
uh it would be awesome if everybody

460
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,960

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,799
mural

463
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,360
so this is a web-based stickies on a

464
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,880
wall

465
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,799

504
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,400
malingering workforce that i have

505

they're all they're all laying about

506
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,799
they're trying to avoid doing work

507
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
they don't want to do anything so we

508
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,520
need to figure out how we're going to

509
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,640

510
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,280

think like it's 1880

543
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,679
okay so it's not 2020

544
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,960
it's 1880. so you don't have to be

545
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,080
politically correct

546
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:25,280
think that like you're in the 1800s

547
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,080

and you'll be able to see the mural and

553
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,080
zoom in and zoom out

554
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,400
um we have a few suggestions already

555
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
not many but it's doing good so we've

556
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,720
got

557
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,159
uh dock their pay sack them

558
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,080
you know if they're not going fast

559
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,760
enough let's sack them

560
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
um cut their break times because they're

561
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
not

562
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
working fast enough we're not getting

563
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
enough widgets

564
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,960
therefore we're not making enough paper

565
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
so you're gonna have to have shorter

566
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,200
breaks you're gonna have to work longer

567
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,400
time

568
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,480
we're gonna have to do some overtime um

569
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,159
if you don't look like you're performing

570
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,080
we're just going to sack you

571
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:17,280
um what else are we going to do

572
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,240
close the toilets adi i don't think

573
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,400
that's going to

574
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,520
work we're going to end up with a very

575
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,080
smelly uh factory floor

576
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,280
punish the slow ones how might you

577
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
punish the slow ones

578
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,720
how might you punish the flow ones or

579
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,360
how might you create incentives

580
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,400
to have people work faster or harder

581
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,200
food reduction

582
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
oh that's mean

583
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,760
that's mean it's not it's not going as

584
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,520
mean as it has done in the past

585
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,200
what things happened in the the 1800s

586
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
chinese conscripts building the

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,840
railroads in the us

588
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,520
i'm sure they didn't get paid well uh

589
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,600
what else was happening in the 1800s

590
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,039
humiliate them send them to australia

591
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,159
yeah everything's trying to kill you in

592
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,360
australia sack them punish them

593
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,480
make them make them join the army

594
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,360
okay so we've got a few uh suggestions

595
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,640
the time

596
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,400
uh is up thank you very much

597
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,679
for your participation uh i will

598
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:30,000
just quickly move this over to the other

599
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,720
views so that everybody else can see

600
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,919
uh and for the recording at what was

601
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,960
created

602
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,559
uh these are our interesting ideas so

603
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,640
punishing the slow ones cutting their

604
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,400
brakes making the mark over time

605
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,279
uh docking their pay uh sacking them

606
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,760
they're not doing enough work uh i have

607
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,360
run

608
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,360
this exercise with many many people

609
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,039
in the room and just to give a little

610
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,039
example of what sort of

611
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,320
uh ideas have been created in the past

612
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,159
uh time off after deliveries

613
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,840
tapping into personal motivation

614
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,880
decreasing lunch time so we saw that

615
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,679
already

616
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,039
employee of the week you know some kind

617
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,159
of bonus

618
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,919
for being the best person this week

619
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,480
uh discipline uh lar well i i don't know

620
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,240
if you

621
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
see on the right there there's armed

622
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
guards enforcers

623
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,360
threat of imminent death large amounts

624
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
of screaming

625
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,600
those whips and there's also free beer

626
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,640
so you can see there can be a lot of

627
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,720
different ways

628
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,760
that you might come up with to solve

629
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,440
this problem

630
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,720
and really um there was no holds barred

631
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,000
in the 1800s there were very few things

632
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,600
that were out of bounds for you as a

633
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,360
company owner

634
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,480
on what you were able to do to your

635
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,120
employees very few rules

636
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:58,000
um so kind of a little bit open so what

637
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,279
what really happened well the thought

638
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
leaders

639
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,080
at the time the main thought leader was

640
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:08,240
a gentleman called frederick winston

641
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,679
taylor and he coined this particular

642
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,679
phrase i'm going to read it out because

643
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,880
i think it's very important

644
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,360
hardly a competent worker can be found

645
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,080
who does not devote a considerable

646
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,360
amount of

647
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,159
time studying just how slowly they can

648
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,880
work

649
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,360
and still convince their employer that

650
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,640
they're going at a good pace

651
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,240
this for me has been the

652
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,400
fundamental basis upon which most

653
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,840
modern management practices has been

654
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,960
built

655
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,799
we don't trust people we they're going

656
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
to do a bad job they're going to try and

657
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,440
get out of doing the work

658
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,760
so we have to control them

659
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,720
that's the founding basis of these

660
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,080
management practices

661
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,120
and it was true at the time

662
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,880
we had disconnected workers who didn't

663
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,720
care about the work

664
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
but if you want people to care about the

665
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,000
work maybe we need to do things

666
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,880
a little bit differently so this phrase

667
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,559
became the foundation upon which

668
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
traditional management practices have

669
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,880
been built

670
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,279
and he created something called the

671
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,080
scientific management method

672
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,279
and and all of the the you put some of

673
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,320
these ideas

674
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,600
on the mural i see some folks are still

675
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,919
looking around

676
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
uh on the other ideas that are in there

677
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,000
uh but

678
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,559
let's develop some standard methods for

679
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,360
performing each job so we're gonna train

680
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,919
the workers

681
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,799
in those standard methods so that was on

682
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,640
the list

683
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
and we might divide workers into

684
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,559
appropriate ability

685
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,600
based groups so the people that make

686
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,039
widget a

687
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,720
will put all of them together and the

688
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,360
people that make widget b because then

689
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,159
we can just control them separately

690
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,600
we're going to create incentives for

691
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,120
increased output

692
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
there were a number of incentives that

693
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,799
you had on the list

694
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,080
over time i'll paying them badly

695
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,039
let me flip back over to uh

696
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,799
the ideas that you created make them

697
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,440
work overtime cut their breaks dock

698
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,679
their pay

699
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
sack threat sack them or just threaten

700
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,919
them with sacking

701
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
humiliate them punish the slow ones

702
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,880
these are all things that are

703
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,120
creating incentives uh

704
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,000
but we need to plan their work we don't

705
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,640
want them to

706
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,080
think we want to plan all of the things

707
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,159
that we're going to do

708
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
i'm sure in some of those statements you

709
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
might you might see

710
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,760
some of the things in your current

711
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,880
management practices maybe in your

712
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,960
organization

713
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
maybe some of these are things that

714
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,640
you've been doing

715
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,760
that's entirely possible these are

716
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,039
practices that

717
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,480
are ingrained in the way we work they're

718
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,080
part of our bureaucracies and

719
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,360
we're going to talk about why we need to

720
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,360
change them in just a moment

721
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,320
after taylor was another fellow called

722
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,760
henry gant

723
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,679
yes that gant and he built on those

724
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,960
tayloristic ideas

725
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,320
and used scientific analysis to improve

726
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,760
the efficiency

727
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,679
in the industry remember we're

728
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,120
mechanizing people people are just

729
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
robots they're just widgets it's

730
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,760
unskilled labor we can train anybody to

731
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,080
do these jobs in the factory

732
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,520
so they created the task and bonus

733
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,159
system

734
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,159
they created a basic wage based on

735
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,640
expected low performance

736
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,600
and then you get a bonus for exceeding

737
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,279
uh

738
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,399
the expectations and maybe we should

739
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,200
bonus the managers for motivating their

740
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,399
staff

741
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,279
to exceed that proficiency so let's

742
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,640
let's find all the the the the bullies

743
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,919
make the managers

744
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,200
uh at the time today there are many

745
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
types of managers

746
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,799
around i've worked with some awesome

747
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,840
managers that

748
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,799
have to work within this system of

749
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,559
traditional management practices and

750
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,840
they do things a little bit differently

751
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,919
and use it to their advantage

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,279
i'm not saying i'm not painting every

753
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,960
manager with the same evil stick

754
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:17,200
but there are certainly many evil

755
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,000
managers out there the system allows

756
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
that to happen

757
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,880
i would like you to also think about the

758
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,440
traditional classroom

759
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,080
in schools create a picture in your head

760
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
of maybe the classroom you grew up with

761
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,360
but

762
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,760
the traditional classroom view that you

763
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,159
see

764
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,559
in in schools everybody sits in rows

765
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,840
everybody has to do the same thing at

766
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,720
the same time

767
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,960
no talking rewards for fulfilled tasks

768
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,320
and incentive based learning

769
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,399
that sounds like a factory floor to me

770
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,760
the school system the modern school

771
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,640
system was designed

772
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,840
to train people with just the

773
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,960
information they need

774
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,320
to work in factories now it's changed

775
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,559
over the years and there are good

776
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,279
teachers and there are bad teachers but

777
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,320
that's the fundamental basis upon which

778
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,919
the system

779
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,919
has been built so traditional management

780
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,600
practices

781
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,600
focus on output not outcomes

782
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,799
traditional management theory comes from

783
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,840
these turn of the century manufacturing

784
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,360
ideas

785
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,919
that came about during the industrial

786
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,480
revolution that had that emphasis on

787
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,320
output

788
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,279
it was what they needed at the time they

789
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,360
needed output

790
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,640
and in that system you measure

791
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,919
efficiency be

792
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,640
by how many output you get

793
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,799
by given input that's the only measure

794
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,159
that really matters

795
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,440
so these ideas were formulated by an

796
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,080
organization

797
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,120
uh called harvard harvard graduate

798
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,720
school

799
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:02,640
and this is their first ever graduating

800
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,000
mba class in 1908

801
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,559
that's a very long time ago and these

802
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
were it was harvard so these were the

803
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,360
wealthy

804
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
leaders or the the children of the

805
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,960
wealthy leaders

806
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,799
of the time and they flocked to

807
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,000
organizations around the world

808
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,159
and these tayloristic uh practices

809
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
these traditional management practices

810
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,240
spread

811
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:30,480
all over the world that's kind of where

812
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,480
we're where we where we ended up

813
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,240
and then in the 1950s a new way

814
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,880
of this new way of working uh

815
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,519
emerged where we're going to divide the

816
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,960
workforce into specific skills

817
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,320
create things sequentially so in in a

818
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,320
particular order

819
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,799
tell them how to do their work encourage

820
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,080
them to specialize in just one thing

821
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,640
and then reward them based on individual

822
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
output that sounds a little bit familiar

823
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,039
it's just

824
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,799
the next uh phase of that idea

825
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,200
this was the birth of sequential working

826
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,320
where you complete your stage and then

827
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,360
pass it on

828
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,880
to the next department marketing

829
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,760
markets the deal sales clinches the deal

830
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,559
contracts codifies the deal business

831
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,440
analysts

832
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,559
document the deal the makers maybe

833
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,039
coders

834
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,159
build the deal could be manufacturing

835
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,200
could be anything

836
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,799
uh testers test the deal and then

837
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,519
operations deploys

838
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,640
and runs the deal whatever those things

839
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,480
are

840
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,399
they don't need to understand anything

841
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,440
outside of their

842
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,960
little box of operations or marketing or

843
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,240
sales or contracts or whatever those

844
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,440
things are

845
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,120
the us military complex came along and

846
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,240
they became the largest

847
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,600
purchaser of services and goods in the

848
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,559
world

849
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,840
for those that don't know uh the us

850
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,399
military today

851
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,600
has a budget of 850 billion dollars

852
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,159
every year and has 2.8

853
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,760
million employees so that's not

854
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,200
including

855
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,040
contractors it's not including uh

856
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,720
consultants all of those things all of

857
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,520
their vendors

858
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,320
and and they became this largest

859
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,200
purchaser

860
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,839
because of that focus uh of trying to

861
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
defeat

862
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,560
communism after the second world war the

863
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,280
us turned towards the russians

864
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,079
and they created a bunch of processes

865
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,079
based on

866
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,240
these ideas taylor and gant

867
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,520
and rewarded their suppliers and

868
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,320
contractors

869
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,960
based on the incentives model so it just

870
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,560
became part of their procurement process

871
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,280
and because it became part of their

872
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,200
procurement process they demanded that

873
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:59,680
all their suppliers work the same way

874
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:03,839
sequentially that's where these ideas

875
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,680
came from this sequential way of working

876
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,400
it spread across the world because it

877
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,400
was so effective when applied

878
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,040
to the most common type of work at the

879
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,079
time which was simple work

880
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,040
widgets in factories however in the

881
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,040
1980s

882
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,880
things began to change it was really

883
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
changing before then but this is when

884
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,079
things really started picking up speed

885
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,079
communication got easier data began to

886
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,760
be processed and the internet

887
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,200
was born this sealed sequential uh

888
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,440
workings fate

889
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,880
even if it would take many years for it

890
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,280
to even realize

891
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,720
that it was doomed today the world is

892
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,440
moving faster

893
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,000
than ever before and how many of the old

894
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,079
guards

895
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,880
are still left the best analogy i have

896
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,960
uh and i don't know uh culturally how

897
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,599
this translates but the best analogy i

898
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
have

899
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,400
is this thing called orienteering which

900
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,440
apparently is some weird sport

901
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,160
in europe um but it it came it has

902
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,640
military

903
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,160
origins because if you're a soldier and

904
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
you need to get from one place to

905
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
another

906
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,320
uh you have to use a map you have to be

907
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,119
able to read a map

908
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
and orienteering was a technique for

909
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,000
practicing map reading

910
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,680
but it's become a sport but in

911
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,760
orienteering uh you have a goal a place

912
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
you have to get to or potentially a set

913
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
of check

914
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,520
points that you have to get to along the

915
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,400
way

916
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,920
uh here is one of the the the the

917
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,920
participants in the sport

918
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,839
checking in at one of the checkpoints

919
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,839
they usually have a little a way of

920
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,640
identifying themselves so they have to

921
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,359
get to every checkpoint along the way

922
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,359
um but the caveat i have for how it

923
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,119
doesn't quite relate to orienteering is

924
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,040
though checkpoints are changing

925
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,040
all the time rather than being in a

926
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
fixed place like they would if you were

927
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,720
all

928
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,200
in a sport together and but you

929
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,040
as a business leader probably have a

930
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,040
vision that describes

931
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,079
the the intended outcome that you

932
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,440
want to have from any change uh

933
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,000
effectively what you're currently

934
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,040
envisaged end state will look like

935
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,680
that end state will evolve over time

936
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,359
but for now you've got this idea of this

937
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,560
is this is where i want to go

938
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,560
you have a goal and we can get behind

939
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,920
that goal you

940
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,560
not some external coach and consultant

941
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,240
need to decide not only what the initial

942
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,880
end state will look like but

943
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,560
what are your first steps going to be

944
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,280
along the way and how you're going to

945
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,480
measure

946
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,440
the outcomes once you have that

947
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,040
you need to make that first step and see

948
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,480
where you get to

949
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,800
while there are some well-known

950
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,000
checkpoints along the way like having an

951
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,960
adaptive backlog

952
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,839
of tactical changes or self-organizing

953
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,880
teams

954
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,960
mostly it's an open field that's why

955
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,079
there's so little guidance

956
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,760
when you speak to agile coaches and

957
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,640
folks in the agile industry you say what

958
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
should i do next

959
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
it's like well i don't know you need to

960
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,480
decide what you want to do

961
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,040
let me explain the problem you're trying

962
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,040
to solve

963
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,599
you've come up with the ideas you as

964
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,400
leaders

965
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,920
need to understand why you are taking a

966
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
particular direction

967
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,000
and what you expect the outcome for your

968
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,640
organization to be

969
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,079
while you may need help you are

970
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,040
accountable

971
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,800
for the changes ahead and only you if

972
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,000
you're the leaders in the organization

973
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,200
you're accountable for those changes as

974
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
you take each step along your journey

975
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,680
you may realize that you were wrong that

976
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,119
this direction leads not to your

977
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,880
intended outcome but

978
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,720
somewhere else you then need to decide

979
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
if that somewhere else is actually a

980
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,119
better place than you thought of

981
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,079
at the start and then figure out what's

982
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,359
my next step where do i need to go next

983
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,440
you need to be free to experiment accept

984
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,520
that any processes and practices you

985
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,760
create would be

986
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,320
imperfectly defined and adapt

987
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,880
to what you discover along the way you

988
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,480
will use

989
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,800
orienteering to stop periodically

990
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,000
reassess both your goal in the direction

991
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,200
you need to go

992
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,599
and then take the next step towards

993
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:31,599
your intended outcomes experimentation

994
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,480
is key to this process you will not

995
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,960
know what will work until you try it

996
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,119
you'll also not know what will not work

997
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,280
think back to how you might have built

998
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,920
your company in the first place

999
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,079
it was likely a short iterative process

1000
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
where you continuously tried different

1001
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,880
things

1002
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,160
figuring out what was a good way to do

1003
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,440
things and keeping the things that

1004
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,920
worked

1005
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,839
and ditching the things that didn't this

1006
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,760
entrepreneur

1007
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,520
entrepreneurial spirit is what we're

1008
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,920
trying to retrieve

1009
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,119
and create a system within which we can

1010
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,040
maintain it

1011
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,720
indefinitely over time we need to remove

1012
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,240
bureaucracy and get back the creativity

1013
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,720
that was smothered by that bureaucracy

1014
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,760
of these traditional practices i want to

1015
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,119
be clear

1016
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,480
that this new state of agility in this

1017
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,000
new state of agility

1018
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,560
everything will change every business

1019
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,800
process you currently have

1020
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,119
was built on the bureaucracy that you

1021
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
have in your organization it was created

1022
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,359
slowly over time

1023
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,680
these bureaucratic processes will have

1024
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,560
to be dismantled as they are no longer

1025
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,960
valid

1026
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,319
for the new speed of the world that

1027
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,599
takes time

1028
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,760
focus and commitment this type of change

1029
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
is not something you can buy in from the

1030
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,280
outside

1031
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,880
and it must be organically and

1032
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,760
iteratively grown

1033
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,760
inside your organization you may hire

1034
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,119
many consultants coaches and trainers

1035
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,400
along the way

1036
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,359
but it is you who must be driving that

1037
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,800
vision

1038
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,000
and setting that direction don't get

1039
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,079
trapped

1040
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,119
into a transformation of one

1041
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,160
bureaucratic

1042
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,760
process for another instead

1043
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,240
evolve your organization out from under

1044
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,920
it

1045
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:30,000
and innovate your way to success

1046
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,800
this is the inevitability of change

1047
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800

maybe it's i think you made a comment on

1074
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,079
management and

1075
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,319
frederick winston taylor he's the source

1076
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,319
of all our problems today

1077
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,280
he's not really he was doing the right

1078
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,400
thing at the time

1079
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:50,160
if you are currently managing a factory

1080
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,200
you're probably going to use the ideas

1081
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,319
that he came up with but as your factory

1082
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,440
moves towards

1083
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,880
replacing the people automation with

1084
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,000
robot automation

1085
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,720
mechanical automation the people that

1086
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,440
then run

1087
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,280
your factory are going to be creative

1088
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,800
people who are solving problems on a

1089
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,800
day-to-day basis and you'll need these

1090
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,240
new

1091
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,240
so any questions

1092
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:26,480
and the question will take about

1093
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:29,440
three to four minutes at five minutes

1094
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,240
we'll take some few any questions please

1095
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,200
any questions for martin

1096
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,720
wow so i think martin your presentation

1097
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,560
was quite

1098
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,920
clear and i think people have yeah

1099
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,960
temptation by the way that's all

1100
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,319

i tried the board i didn't succeed

1104
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,480
it depends on how fast your computer is

1105
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,280
and the internet and all kinds of things

1106
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,560
so

1107
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,079
um it's okay i just put a a link

1108
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,599

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:22,240
my linkedin profile as well if you're

1111
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:24,640

there any other any other questions it

1113
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,440
can be anything it doesn't have to be on

1114
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
what i was talking about

1115
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,000
i don't mind

1116
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,640
awesome no questions

1117
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,000
[Music]

1118
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,800
martin i actually do have a question

1119
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,200
yeah

1120
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:52,400
i took my ipod modification with eggs in

1121
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,359
and i want to become like you right

1122
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,960
so that i can become a pm a scrum dot

1123
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,760
org trainer

1124
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,480
so i reached out to scrum.org and i said

1125
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,400
to them

1126
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,640
that i'd like i want to do their

1127
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,520
certifications

1128
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,359
and and they said that for me to become

1129
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,079
one of their trainer i still have to go

1130
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,599
through the process of doing the um

1131
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,440
the psm1 and above

1132
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,640
i mean what advice do you have for me

1133
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,920
though

1134
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,480
uh so for psm1

1135
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,839
reading the scrum guide is probably

1136
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
reading and understanding the scrum

1137
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,200
guide is

1138
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,560
is really the the what what you need for

1139
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,640
the psm1

1140
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,880
psm2 is a lot more situational questions

1141
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,480
um so having some experience as a scrum

1142
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,599
master works well

1143
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:45,760
uh for for psm2 um

1144
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,800
psm3 is a lot i think it's um

1145
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,079
i think there's five five plus essay

1146
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,200
questions

1147
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,760
uh so it's marked by uh a human rather

1148
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,680
than

1149
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,200
marked by the system uh and that's

1150
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,560
that's a lot more complicated if you

1151
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,560
want to be a trainer you need to get

1152
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:06,160
95 in order to

1153
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,800
pass um

1154
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,280
so i would just follow the the learning

1155
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,240
path

1156
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,000
on the website there's a list of on the

1157
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
scribbler website there's a link for i

1158
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,119
want to be a trainer

1159
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,359
and they have a number of different

1160
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,160
routes in there's a route in through

1161
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,160
kanban

1162
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,640
there's a i think you're not a coder

1163
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,640
mercy

1164
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,280
i'm not a cro i'm not a coder i'm a

1165
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
scrum master

1166
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,200
okay yeah so the that you want to use

1167
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,520
the psm

1168
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,280
roots then there is a coder route but uh

1169
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,079
you want to use the psm route

1170
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,079
um so yeah it just it's it's taking the

1171
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,720
assessments getting a high enough score

1172
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,400
and you will need 85 percent you also

1173
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,760
need to attend

1174
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,760
a special um psm

1175
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,119
class uh that's run by scrum.org they

1176
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
run them periodically and they're

1177
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,280
special

1178
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,920
train the trainer uh kind of

1179
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,599
events that's a little bit longer and

1180
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,920
they dive into

1181
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,119
some of the things around why we talk

1182
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,280
about things in the class and the

1183
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,319
purpose of the different exercises

1184
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,119
um it's it's it's an involved process

1185
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,560
it is an involved process it's much so

1186
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,400
you should have become a trainer when i

1187
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,640

1188
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,640
