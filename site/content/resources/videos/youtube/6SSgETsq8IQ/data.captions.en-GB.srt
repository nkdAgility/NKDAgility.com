00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:06,330
The Professional Scrum Product Owner is a
hands-on, activity-based course where students

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,700
explore Professional Scrum and develop an
understanding of the Product Ownerâ€™s critical

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,780
role on the Scrum Team.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,080
Being a professional Product Owner encompasses
more than writing requirements or managing

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,090
a Product Backlog.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,449
Product Owners need to have a concrete understanding
of all product management aspects, including

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,110
but not limited to product ownership, that
drives value from their products.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,790
Being a Product Owner is a key position that
sets the tone for product leadership and the

9
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,610
definition of success in the organization.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,990
As a Product Owner, modern product management
practices and mindsets are expected to be

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,210
put into practice daily.

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:56,230
The Product Owner is accountable for and has
the authority to maximize the value of the

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,630
product and the effectiveness of the Product
Backlog.

14
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,429
Our training is delivered as an interactive,
activity-based course over half-day sessions

15
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:07,900
using Microsoft Teams, and Mural.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,869
Throughout the class, students learn several
Product Ownership practices that they can

17
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,119
use once they leave the classroom while also
receiving an introduction to Agile Product

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,119
Management.

19
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,789
Between sessions, we provide additional reading,
writing, and watching activities to maximise

20
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:28,890
the learning opportunities and complement
the classroom experience.

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,829
After the conclusion of the class, we provide
access to a community of peers and continued

22
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,479
access to the trainer through office hours,
quarterly catchups, and constant engagement.

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,850
All students are given a password to take
the PSPO1 assessment to maximise validated

24
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
learning.

25
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,399
If they take it within 14 days and are unsuccessful,
they will be granted a second attempt.

26
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,070
As part of our validated learning experience,
we provide a 30-minute learning review, a

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,490
one-hour coaching session, and access to future
courses at a 30% discount on future classes.
