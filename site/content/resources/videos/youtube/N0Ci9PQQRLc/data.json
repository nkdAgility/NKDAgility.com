    "description": "#scrum is defined as easy to understand, yet incredibly difficult to master by the co-creators of #scrum. The #scrumguide is less than 20 pages long and so you could move through the theory in a couple of hours, at most.\n\nSo, if it's incredibly easy to understand and you're able to flick through the guide in less than 60 minutes, why do we have intensive #scrummaster, #productowner, and #agilecoach training? Why does it take people years to master #scrum and become an effective #agilecoach or #agileconsultant?\n\nBecause it's hard. Because each application of #scrum is unique, and the context of every application comes with it's own series of challenges and opportunities.\n\nIt's one thing to read a guide to a classroom of people, and it's an entirely different kettle of fish to actively transform people and deeply embed the learning experience through professional, certified #scrumtraining.\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how his years of experience as a software engineer, DevOps consultant, and #agile practitioner have informed his training style at NKD Agility.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
