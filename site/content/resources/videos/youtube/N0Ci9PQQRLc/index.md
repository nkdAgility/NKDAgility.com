 #scrum is defined as easy to understand, yet incredibly difficult to master by the co-creators of #scrum. The #scrumguide is less than 20 pages long and so you could move through the theory in a couple of hours, at most.

So, if it's incredibly easy to understand and you're able to flick through the guide in less than 60 minutes, why do we have intensive #scrummaster, #productowner, and #agilecoach training? Why does it take people years to master #scrum and become an effective #agilecoach or #agileconsultant?

Because it's hard. Because each application of #scrum is unique, and the context of every application comes with it's own series of challenges and opportunities.

It's one thing to read a guide to a classroom of people, and it's an entirely different kettle of fish to actively transform people and deeply embed the learning experience through professional, certified #scrumtraining.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains how his years of experience as a software engineer, DevOps consultant, and #agile practitioner have informed his training style at NKD Agility.
