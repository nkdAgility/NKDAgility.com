When I reflect on how my real-world experience shapes my training style, I realise just how pivotal my journey has been. I began my career as a software engineer, diving into the world of coding just before .NET emerged. My first year was spent with ASP, but once .NET came along, I found my sweet spot. This foundation has been instrumental in my understanding of software development and the intricacies of the industry.

In 2008, I was honoured to be recognised as a Microsoft MVP for my work with Team Foundation Server (TFS). This accolade opened doors to a wealth of resources and connections, particularly the annual MVP Summit in Redmond, Washington. Imagine three and a half thousand MVPs from around the globe converging in one place! It was an incredible opportunity to network and learn from some of the brightest minds in technology.

During my time as an MVP, I was part of a tight-knit group of 80 to 90 professionals focused on DevOps and Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). This was a transformative period as DevOps was just beginning to gain traction. I absorbed knowledge from my peers, which not only enhanced my skills but also allowed me to impress others in the field. 

My journey took me to Australia, where I worked remotely for a year with Adam Cogan, before moving to Seattle as a DevOps consultant. Over three years, I had the privilege of working with various clients across the United States, spanning 15 different states and numerous industries—from aerospace to healthcare and even finance. One particularly memorable project involved a finance company that managed the finances for Hollywood stars. Their building was mostly empty, save for one floor dedicated to their operations. 

This diverse experience has equipped me with a treasure trove of stories. I’ve encountered organisations facing challenges that often seem insurmountable, yet I’ve always found that there’s a silver lining. When I share these stories during training sessions, it resonates with participants. Knowing that others have faced even greater dysfunction can be a powerful motivator. It instils hope and encourages individuals to believe that improvement is possible.

In my training, I emphasise the importance of learning from both successes and failures. I often recount instances where certain strategies didn’t pan out, highlighting the lessons learned. This approach not only fosters a culture of openness but also encourages participants to engage more deeply with the material. 

As a Professional Scrum Trainer (PST), my background as a software engineer lends me credibility when working with teams. I’ve been in their shoes, and I understand the challenges they face. My years as a DevOps consultant have provided me with a broader perspective on the processes surrounding software development, particularly the journey towards continuous delivery. I firmly believe that there is no software on this planet that cannot move towards continuous delivery. 

Ultimately, my experiences form the bedrock of my training and consulting efforts. They inform the classes I develop and the insights I share, aiming to empower others to embrace change and enhance their practices. My hope is that through sharing my journey and the lessons learned along the way, I can inspire others to embark on their own paths of growth and improvement in the ever-evolving world of software development.
