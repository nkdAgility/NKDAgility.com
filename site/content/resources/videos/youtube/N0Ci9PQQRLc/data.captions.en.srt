1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,139
how does my real world experience

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:17,220
translate into my training style well

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,440
I think they're neat for that you to a

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,619
little bit understand

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:26,460
my my my experience I guess

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,980
um I was a software engineer for 10

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,619
years I just got into software

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,719
engineering the year before.net came

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,500
along

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,480
so I was ASP for a year and then

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,420
straight into into.net and that's where

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,640
I I'd really been ever since I mean I I

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,680
I do other things but that's mainly

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,559
where I where I where my sweet spot is

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,579
right my my comfort zone

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,820
um and then I got recognized by

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,100
Microsoft as doing some interesting

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,620
things with Team Foundation server

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,019
right I was that was and I became a

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,619
Microsoft MVP

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,040
um in 2008

22
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:13,560
uh and then what really happened was

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,180
um you got when you become an MVP right

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,100
you kind of get access to a whole bunch

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,680
of internal stuff you get access to lots

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,720
of free tools and lots of things but the

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,900
big thing is you go to the MVP Summit

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,680
every year and the MVP Summit is three

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,180
and a half thousand uh uh MVPs from all

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,460
over the world all the different

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,320
countries all the different Technologies

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,720
all descend on Redmond in uh Washington

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,939
state in the US

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,540
um we basically take over the whole of

35
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,600
Redmond all of the hotels uh for uh for

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,880
a week and Microsoft puts on a whole

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,040
bunch of sessions and events and all

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,840
kinds of things

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,640
so you get you start to get these

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,799
personal connections with all sorts of

41
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,240
other people in the in the in the

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:07,259
organization uh but my experience was my

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,560
uh competence was TFS kind of TFS devops

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:14,280
Alm was that space and there was between

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,959
80 and 90 MVPs in that category and this

46
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,840
was a really tight-knit group because

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,420
devops was emerging at the time it was

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,040
definitely loads of people who were at

49
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,500
the top of their game right because

50
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,220
they're into all these different things

51
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,220
and Technologies and coming into that

52
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,520
world and writing a lot of content in

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,900
that world and really understanding what

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,879
it is that we're trying to do with

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,360
devops like I leveraged a lot of their

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,480
knowledge absorbing all of their ideas

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,760
allowed me to then uh I guess impress

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,239
some of the people there

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,819
um and I worked for a year remotely for

60
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,580
an Australian company with Adam Cogan

61
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,620
um and then I got hired by Steve Borg to

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,560
go live in Seattle

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,599
um as a devops consultant and I spent uh

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,640
three years I think it was Alm right

65
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,519
application life cycle Management pln

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,739
Consultant bit devops uh consultant for

67
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,780
three years in the US and I effectively

68
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,980
had a different customer every week or a

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,620
different customer every two weeks

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,780
across the us so I think I spent time in

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,080
about 15 different states

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,120
um I saw all the industries like there's

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,400
no specific industry that devops is

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,400
relevant for it's any company that has

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,099
software so we did Aerospace we did

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,140
military we did I think I didn't work on

77
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,879
that project but the nuclear power

78
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,440
plants

79
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:42,780
um Healthcare uh Finance I did a gig for

80
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,120
uh finance company that does the

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,220
finances for all of the stars in

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,599
Hollywood and so they have this huge

83
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,620
building and they only have one floor at

84
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,900
the top and the rest of the building's

85
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,420
empty it was really interesting

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,840
um but

87
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,299
that experience of seeing all these

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,040
different organizations seeing what

89
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,860
they're doing seeing how they're

90
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,260
treating and engaging people means that

91
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,060
I I almost I think I've never had a

92
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,700
circumstance where I don't have a story

93
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,739
for where there's somebody else that's

94
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,720
more dysfunctional than whatever the

95
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,040
person that's talking to me the story

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,680
that they have

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,759
so I I think I think that's a huge power

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,940
in the training world because you want

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,620
you want people that you're training to

100
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,699
realize that there's light at the end of

101
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,220
the tunnel

102
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,500
you want them to realize that they can

103
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,960
get to somewhere else and unfortunately

104
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,419
I think this is a very human thing

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,600
knowing that somebody else is worse

106
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:47,160
makes you feel better right and it makes

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,620
you go maybe I can be less worse right

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
maybe I can so then I'm listening more

109
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,699
and engaging more so I think those

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,900
stories help from that perspective and

111
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,699
but also bringing the stories of

112
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,560
um how people have solved particular

113
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,199
problems or even

114
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,460
things that haven't worked right oh I've

115
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,680
had a couple of customers that I've

116
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,419
tried that this way and it's just not

117
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,960
worked for them at all they just had to

118
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:17,120
to to ditch it and I think that is one

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:22,020
of the core characteristics of not just

120
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,199
uh uh um me as a PST but most of the

121
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,539
psts that I interact with are people

122
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,460
that have worked in Industry that have

123
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,919
worked with lots of customers that have

124
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,240
all of these stories and and there's

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,460
nothing more interesting than a whole

126
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,840
bunch of psts getting together

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,860
um to have a conversation about all

128
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,419
these crazy things that have been

129
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,940
happening in organizations because then

130
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,979
you can share those stories and bring

131
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,860
more things to the table when you're

132
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:49,440
training so I feel like that that

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,500
experience of being a software engineer

134
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,320
right that's one thing that that it

135
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,000
lends me credibility when I'm working

136
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,580
with people in teams that build software

137
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,500
right because I have been the person

138
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,320
building the software I understand how

139
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,380
that works and then the the seven years

140
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,840
as a devops consultant

141
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,960
um is that that little bit level above

142
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,060
all of the processes around how we build

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,520
software moving towards continuous

144
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,620
delivery

145
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,020
being able to categorically tell people

146
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,479
there is no software on this planet that

147
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,580
can't move towards continuous delivery

148
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,180
right there's no pulling the wool over

149
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,800
my eyes for uh uh capabilities in that

150
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,280
space

151
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,479
um and then moving into into training

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,759
and

153
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,220
agile Consulting

154
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,620
means that all of that stuff is the

155
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,840
foundation upon which I'm I'm building

156
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,180
the classes and the courseware and and

157
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,460
what I'm trying to do and what I'm

158
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,520
hoping people will learn and engage with

159
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,539
and and find out more about

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,539
um what they can do
