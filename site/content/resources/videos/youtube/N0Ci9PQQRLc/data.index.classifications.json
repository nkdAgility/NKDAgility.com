    "ai_penalty_details": "none",
    "final_score": 1.0,
    "reasoning": "The content does not mention Service Level Expectation (SLE) at all, nor does it reference any related concepts in the specific Agile, Scrum, or Kanban context required by the definition. While the article discusses the author's background as a software engineer, DevOps consultant, and Scrum trainer, its focus is on professional journey, storytelling in training, and broad themes of continuous improvement and DevOps. There is no discussion of SLE calculation, application, transparency, or any foundational concepts or practices exclusive to SLE. The intent is personal and motivational rather than educational about SLE. The audience could partly overlap with SLE practitioners (Scrum, DevOps, and software professionals), leading to a slightly higher audience alignment score, but overall signal-to-noise is low for this category since none of the content is relevant to SLE in the required context. No penalties were applied as the content is not outdated or critical; it simply does not address the category.",
