1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
so

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,940
the difference between a a an agile

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,240
leader and a traditional manager

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,880
is that a traditional manager tends to

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,700
focus on

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,920
um telling people what to do right on

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,060
creating a a walls so that people can

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,859
focus

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,960
but in actual fact they reduce

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,580
communication

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
um they reduce the capability of the

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,699
organization to make decisions and

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,099
reduce the capability of the

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,860
organization to respond to the market

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,200
it's not it's not their fault as

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,660
traditional managers it's the system

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,540
within which they're expected to operate

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,040
right so they're they're just following

19
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,840
the the the conventions of the

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,640
organization that they're in

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,980
but the the agile leader I think in

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,680
those organizations challenges those

23
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,640
organizations pushes them towards

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,620
thinking differently and enabling people

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,800
to make the decisions that they need to

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,800
make
