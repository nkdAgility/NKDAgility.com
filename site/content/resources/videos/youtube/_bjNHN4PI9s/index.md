Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to share my experiences and insights from running live virtual classrooms, particularly focusing on the technologies that enhance our learning environment. As a professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) trainer with Naked Agility, I’ve had the opportunity to facilitate numerous classes, and I’ve learned a thing or two about making the most of our digital tools. 

### Embracing Technology in Virtual Learning

When I first started running live virtual classes, I noticed that many students felt a bit overwhelmed. Not only were they grappling with the concepts of Scrum, but they were also navigating new technologies. To ease this transition, I’ve been using two primary tools: **Microsoft Teams** for video conferencing and **Mural** for digital whiteboarding. Let’s dive into how these tools can enhance your learning experience.

#### Microsoft Teams: Your Virtual Classroom

Microsoft Teams is a powerful platform that allows us to connect and collaborate effectively. Here are some tips to ensure you have a smooth experience:

- **Download the App**: I highly recommend downloading the Microsoft Teams app rather than using the web version. The app provides a much better experience, especially for our two-day classroom activities.
  
- **Logging In**: When you connect, use the email address I invited you with. This could be your corporate credentials or a Microsoft account. If you encounter issues, don’t hesitate to reach out to me for assistance.

- **Navigating Teams**: Once logged in, ensure you switch to the **Naked Agility Limited** account in the top right corner. This will grant you access to all the features we’ll be using during the class.

- **Joining Meetings**: You’ll find a join button for meetings in the channels. Even if no one else is in the meeting, you can still join and get familiar with the environment.

- **Breakout Rooms**: We often use breakout rooms for group activities. You’ll be able to switch between the main room and your team’s room seamlessly, allowing for effective collaboration.

#### Mural: The Digital Whiteboard

Mural is another fantastic tool that I’ve integrated into my classes. It serves as a digital whiteboard where we can brainstorm, collaborate, and visualise our ideas. Here’s how to make the most of Mural:

- **Accessing Mural**: I’ll share a link to the specific Mural we’ll be using in class. Once you’re in, you’ll see an outline on the right side, which helps you navigate through the content.

- **Creating Notes**: You can easily add notes by double-clicking anywhere on the board. Customise your post-it notes by changing their colours to keep things organised.

- **Facilitator’s View**: As your facilitator, I can summon everyone to specific points on the Mural, ensuring we’re all on the same page during discussions.

- **Timers and Voting**: We’ll use timers for our time-boxed activities, and I’ll facilitate voting sessions to gather feedback and ideas from the group. This interactive approach keeps everyone engaged and involved.

### Preparing for Class

I’ve found that the first half-day of class can feel lengthy for those unfamiliar with these technologies. To combat this, I conduct a tech check before we dive into the content. This allows everyone to familiarise themselves with Teams and Mural, ensuring we can focus on learning rather than [troubleshooting]({{< ref "/tags/troubleshooting" >}}).

### Conclusion

Incorporating tools like Microsoft Teams and Mural into our virtual classrooms has transformed the way we learn and collaborate. By embracing these technologies, we can create an engaging and interactive learning environment that mirrors the dynamics of in-person classes.

I hope this overview helps you feel more prepared for our upcoming sessions. Remember, the goal is to learn and grow together, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out. Let’s make the most of our time together!
