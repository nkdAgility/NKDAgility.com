1
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:31,200
hey welcome to running a live virtual

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,670
classroom my name is Martin nature wood

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,890
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

4
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:40,200
Rhonda dark and I run our company called

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,200
naked agility out of Scotland

6
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,690
naked agility is available for DevOps

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,690
and agile training

8
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,909
[Music]

9
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:06,370
okay so I been running a number of live

10
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:11,680
virtual classes I've run two so far and

11
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:13,750
I have noticed that em when students

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,360
first come in to the class it can be a

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,610
little bit difficult and daunting not

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,810
just maybe learning scrum for the first

15
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,880
time but also learning new technologies

16
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:30,580
for the first time so I wanted to cover

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:34,540
the two technologies that I will be

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:37,000
using in my trainings one is Microsoft

19
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,760
teams as I'm using that for video

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,330
conferencing and for some communication

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,330
channels and I'm also using a product

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:49,750
called mural for digital whiteboarding

23
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:56,250
so get some of that feel of an in-person

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,250
class so first off Microsoft teams

25
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:10,629
so Microsoft teams is a tool from

26
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:14,610
Microsoft that allows us to create calls

27
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:18,280
one of the first hurdles to get over is

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:21,099
connecting to Microsoft teams we do

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,560
recommend that you download and install

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,709
the app rather than use the web version

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,209
it gives a much better experience during

32
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,950
the class the web version is good if

33
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,250
you're just joining a meeting for a

34
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,549
short period of time but we're doing two

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:39,400
full days of classroom activities and

36
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:45,250
really having the the thick client is

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:47,140
important when you connect open up

38
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,650
Microsoft teams it'll ask you to log in

39
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,629
you should log in with the email address

40
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:57,640
that I invited you to the class with and

41
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:01,150
hopefully that will be the same as your

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,010
corporate credentials or it might be a B

43
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,209
or as your Active Directory credentials

44
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:10,870
from your corporation or it might be an

45
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:14,380
MS a Microsoft account so like the same

46
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,079
thing you log into Xbox or Skype and any

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,599
of those things if it's a not one of

48
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:23,470
those email addresses so might be your

49
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:27,220
Gmail it might be whatever you will be

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:30,130
asked to enable that as a Microsoft

51
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:34,359
account and just like Google do this as

52
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,730
well you're able to enable any email

53
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:39,970
address regardless of what platform it's

54
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,940
from as an account you can use to log

55
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:46,150
into Microsoft services and so it's just

56
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,549
a case of setting setting that up if

57
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,160
you're coming on under an MSA I do

58
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,739
recommend that you use your corporate

59
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,310
credentials if you can and if you need

60
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:59,470
to change your email address because

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:03,549
your corporate corporation might block

62
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:07,660
your ability to log into my teams as a

63
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:10,449
guest then that please ping me and I

64
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,400
will change your email to something else

65
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:17,880
and you maybe come in under an MSA

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,590
so let's take a look at teams teams is

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,180
not the simplest application in the

68
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,729
world it does come with a lot of

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,770
features and we're only going to be

70
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:30,180
using a small subset of those features

71
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:33,539
but it's useful to get just at some of

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,690
the the nuance of of how you connect in

73
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:40,560
now you might have joined teams using a

74
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,720
meeting invite and when you join using a

75
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,080
meeting invite you're coming in not as

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,910
an on earth indicated guest which means

77
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,610
that you don't have access to some of

78
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,870
the tools that we're going to be using

79
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,800
what you want to do when you come into

80
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,070
teams is on the top right hand side of

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,560
teams next to your profile picture there

82
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,979
will be a little drop-down list and and

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,630
it should say your company name if you

84
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,229
normally log into teams with your

85
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:13,800
company and I you should change that

86
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,430
drop-down list so that it says naked

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,750
agility limited that's my company and

88
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,750
once you've done that you'll see

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:36,610
so just reordering that so here I've got

90
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:41,630
a live virtual PSF on the 1st of January

91
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:44,990
2015 for my demo account here and what

92
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,080
I've done is created a single meeting

93
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,330
the everybody in that team will have

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,640
access to so what will happen is I will

95
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,700
add you to the team I'll invite you to

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,460
the team you'll get an invitation

97
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,290
request via email click the link follow

98
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,770
the instructions and then you'll be able

99
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:08,420
to come in here as a fully fledged guest

100
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:13,370
in my team's account now once you're in

101
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,920
here if you click on any of the items

102
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,890
that have this little symbol here you'll

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,050
be able to go in and open the meeting

104
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,330
and in the top right hand side you'll

105
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,680
have a join button so even if nobody

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,990
else is in there

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,040
you will have a join button to be able

108
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:34,610
to to get in so if you click join

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,430
because you're already authenticated it

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,580
will just allow you to have access right

111
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,130
away so I'm going to turn my video off

112
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:48,490
so we don't get confused by what's

113
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,490
coming up here and I'm going to join now

114
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,900
okay let me make myself a little bit

115
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,540
smaller there we go

116
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,630
so once you're connected to the team

117
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:06,330
you'll obviously see the the carousel of

118
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,430
people's videos you should have both a

119
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,940
short conversation and assure

120
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,670
participants enabled and if you do not

121
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,290
you have not come in under an

122
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,200
authenticated account you've come in

123
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:22,230
under an anonymous account which can

124
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,330
happen but if you come in under an

125
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,760
authenticated account negative jollity

126
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,720
limited then these buttons will be

127
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,520
enabled for you one of the things that

128
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,940
we're going to do is part of the the

129
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,460
team is ruined to work in breakout rooms

130
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,750
so this is the main channel that will be

131
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,620
open all day this is where when we get

132
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,570
together and we have our big room events

133
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:51,690
with however many people are in the

134
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:54,090
class and everybody will be in this room

135
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,610
so most people will set with mute on

136
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:00,030
when people start talking at the moment

137
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:03,690
that you can only have nine videos in

138
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:07,050
and I don't know what you call it

139
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,510
gallery nine videos in a gallery and

140
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,460
whoever's talking will be one of those

141
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,840
nine videos in the gallery and if you

142
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,120
have a particular interest in an

143
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:22,170
individual you can right-click on their

144
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:24,480
picture and pin it to the gallery so

145
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,950
that they don't disappear but what I'm

146
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,020
going to do is I'm actually going to go

147
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,510
over here onto the left-hand side and

148
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,130
you'll see the team's button again if

149
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,100
you commit not authenticated you won't

150
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:38,910
have this you should open team's log in

151
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,330
and switch to negative ility but if I

152
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:45,600
click on teams I'll go back to the main

153
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,150
view where we're looking at the team the

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,090
call will be in this little display here

155
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:53,460
so whoever's talking will have the the

156
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,680
picture the one picture you can have

157
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,710
there and and then you'll see down here

158
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,560
that this team has two channels general

159
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:04,190
and team X the general channel has a

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,400
little icon to see that the

161
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,280
is currently a meeting underway in that

162
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,190
channel and if you go in click on that

163
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,380
channel you'll see here that you'll have

164
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,230
a big join button because the meeting is

165
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,660
currently under way and the same option

166
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,670
to click through into the calendar item

167
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,860
and start it but because it's already

168
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,870
started you can just join it and go

169
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:32,930
straight in which is really powerful and

170
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:35,480
when you're instructed to you have

171
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,670
particular exercises that are done in

172
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:43,100
teams each team will have maybe teams 1

173
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,480
2 3 4 maybe they'll have names it

174
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,380
depends on the type of class we're

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,110
running but each of those teams will be

176
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,540
listed here I'll be creating them during

177
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,490
the class and if I click on this team

178
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,820
you'll see it's currently empty it was

179
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,630
brand new it has nothing in it but we

180
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:06,170
want to create a space for that group of

181
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,470
people to be able to to interact if

182
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:13,010
there's not one already you can actually

183
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,760
click meet now and then it's actually

184
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,160
it's helpful if you put in the name of

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,620
the team and then whatever else you want

186
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:29,120
after that and you can just click on

187
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:32,330
meet no so now I'm in our second team

188
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,620
meeting oh there we go so there's my let

189
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:39,650
us earn the camera off again otherwise

190
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,330
somebody might freak out and you can see

191
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:45,800
on the left hand side here that the

192
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:48,410
other main room has been put on hold so

193
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,780
if I go back to teams again you'll see

194
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,800
that there's two call started and I'm

195
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:58,280
currently participating in team X and I

196
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,550
have main on hold this means if I just

197
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:05,120
leave these calls open so I don't click

198
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,910
hang up when I change between calls I

199
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,070
can actually just go here click play and

200
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:15,610
now I'm in the main room so if I open up

201
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,780
full screen now I'm in the main room

202
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,340
Nariman team X

203
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,090
now I'm in the main room so I can very

204
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:25,640
easily and quickly switch between those

205
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,530
those rooms we normally run with

206
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,410
multiple facilitators so there will be

207
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:33,020
somebody to help with this but once you

208
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,270
get to grips with it you went to the the

209
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,850
team room for a short period of time you

210
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,210
pop back out when we're doing the the

211
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,370
main exercises and it's it flows pretty

212
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,860
well and it's a very quick transition

213
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,350
now one of the things that I can do is

214
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,550
you'll see and you've got a little short

215
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:57,650
conversation at Wendell here in the main

216
00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:00,200
room if I want to send you some

217
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,990
information while you're in that room

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:09,470
and I'm actually able without joining

219
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:13,130
the room it to go in here and hit time

220
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,690
is up to let you know to come back to

221
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:20,420
the main room and when I send that in

222
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:22,670
your team X meeting that you're having a

223
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,830
discussion at this short conversation

224
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,560
will actually light up and you'll see

225
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,860
the times up in the meeting chat on the

226
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,350
right-hand side that's a very quick way

227
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,150
for me to do that you may not notice if

228
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,400
you don't notice give you a moment then

229
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,620
I'll pop in and say oh we need to come

230
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,660
back to the main room because I'll be

231
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,360
able to switch between multiple teams as

232
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,780
well and I typically run this class with

233
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,510
between these classes between 10 and 20

234
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,920
people specifically for the PSF and I

235
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,530
always have at least one additional

236
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,910
facilitator to help make sure you can

237
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:02,150
switch between those rooms effectively

238
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,760
in addition to that so I went too high

239
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:09,080
on those two cars no hang up those two

240
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,080
calls they're finished and at the end of

241
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,500
the class you'll be invited to join the

242
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,410
professional scrum at community team

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,630
here this is a team that everybody that

244
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,700
has gone through one of my classes is a

245
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:28,400
member of and and in here there's some

246
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:31,400
interesting chat but there's also access

247
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,230
to the course where you'll have a direct

248
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,530
link in the email that I send at the end

249
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:40,220
of the class and but if you use teams to

250
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:43,040
access this files and data for example

251
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,860
if I open up the PSF you'll see a list

252
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,000
of the course where that has been

253
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,310
available and I make the PDFs available

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,550
for each version of the courseware that

255
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,470
comes out so I'm continuously updating

256
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,440
this so if you did take a previous class

257
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,730
you'll be able to go in and get a newer

258
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,180
version of the courseware when it

259
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:08,350
becomes available and there's some extra

260
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:11,420
material in here available as well and

261
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:16,490
if you click on class media you'll have

262
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:20,480
a folder for your team your class that

263
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:23,240
only you and the people on your class

264
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,570
will be able to access they'll that will

265
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,030
only be visible to those folks and it

266
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,430
will have additional things like if we

267
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,580
took pictures during the class and if we

268
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:37,730
use murals and PDF them or other things

269
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,610
then they will end up in that folder

270
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:44,210
there and in addition to that I have a

271
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:47,390
folder with all of the presentations

272
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:51,410
that I do at conferences so sometimes

273
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:54,290
I'll mention them in the class because

274
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:57,170
adds value to our discussion but maybe

275
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,330
not 100% relevant for everybody so we

276
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:02,480
don't do it in the class plus we only

277
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,130
have two days so you can go and see some

278
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,600
of these presentations that have been

279
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,880
done previously and those recordings

280
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,880
online as well on my youtube channel so

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,990
that was I kind of walkthrough of how

282
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,740
we'll be using

283
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:23,180
teams in the class hopefully that was

284
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,150
useful and will help you figure out how

285
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:27,890
to get things going as quickly as

286
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,540
possible one of the things we do find is

287
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,280
that the first half day can be a little

288
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,990
bit lengthy that when folks don't

289
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,410
understand the technology or haven't

290
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:41,300
used it before and so just this is just

291
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:44,390
to give you a quick brief so I think we

292
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,690
need to have a look at the second piece

293
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,640
of technology

294
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,640
which is mural

295
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:06,060
okay so mural is a digital whiteboarding

296
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:08,850
tool and it's reasonably powerful we've

297
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,010
been using it quite extensively for

298
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,860
classes both of the classes that I've

299
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,690
run have used it and many other scrum

300
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:21,269
trainers have used this class as well

301
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:23,970
and so let me switch to mural is

302
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:27,420
available in the web there has a number

303
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,220
of pretty straightforward capabilities

304
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,790
as well as some advanced capabilities as

305
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:36,480
well and I'll be sharing a link directly

306
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,980
to the individual mural with you

307
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,930
and you'll be able to go directly into

308
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,529
that mural so this will just take a

309
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,529
second to load

310
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:54,180
there we go so this is at the mural that

311
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:58,350
I'll be using for my class on Monday

312
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:02,310
well this is the kind of demo make a

313
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,439
mass version of it and in this you'll

314
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,000
see there's an outline on the right hand

315
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,910
side if you don't have an outline

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,410
there's a button to toggle the outline

317
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:16,050
up there and and we'll start on at

318
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,089
preparation where we'll do some

319
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,790
introductions and we'll figure out who

320
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,199
everybody is what we're doing here and

321
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,280
that kind of thing we will also have

322
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,199
slides in combination with this as well

323
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,380
and just to note that if you want to

324
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,330
take notes or you're asked to UM add

325
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,490
data to these pages you can actually

326
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,610
just double click anywhere on any page

327
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,080
and it will put a post-it there and if

328
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,620
you want to change your post-it color

329
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,260
you can change it in here and then you

330
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,840
can add other post-its and if you do

331
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,640
another post-it close to a post-it that

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,040
you've changed it will be the same as

333
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,040
the one you just created but if you do

334
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,929
it next table I don't put their next two

335
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,520
other ones that will be yellow and that

336
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,990
will be a purple circle so there's a

337
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,510
number of tools to be able to do that

338
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:11,610
text shapes drawing images you can do

339
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,160
anything you like on there and just move

340
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,520
them around and do a bunch of things

341
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,770
with them what I'll be doing during the

342
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,840
class as a facilitator this is the

343
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:26,520
facilitators view that you're seeing now

344
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,410
is I'll be able to go in in here and

345
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,840
I'll be able to summon everybody to that

346
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,309
this point so I'll be instructing all of

347
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,530
the students in the class might be 20

348
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:36,480
people to all go to the same mural and

349
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,309
I'll see a little icons down in the

350
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,620
bottom for each of the students that are

351
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:42,809
in here and when I summon everybody

352
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,740
they'll come and see the same thing as

353
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:49,020
me they'll have follow enabled on me so

354
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,179
you can see that somebody who's left it

355
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,169
open on their computer from the last

356
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:58,020
class and has anonymous elephant and our

357
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,320
self aunt is now following me so as I

358
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,020
drag around as

359
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,800
move around they'll have their display

360
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,960
moved as well and they'll see exactly

361
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,820
what what I'm seeing so we can talk

362
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:15,480
about it we can have discussions we can

363
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:18,460
talk about those and those capabilities

364
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,340
in addition to that this is just the

365
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,830
main mural we're all all of us will be

366
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,220
working there's also a separate team

367
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,110
based at mural just for teams and for

368
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,090
teams to work in for for each class

369
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,410
again it depends on the class which

370
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,230
murals we use this is for the

371
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,870
professional scrum foundations class and

372
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:41,590
what I'll hopefully be doing is I'll be

373
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:45,160
setting timers when we have time boxes

374
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,900
so even if you're in your separate teams

375
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:52,150
meeting you

376
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:54,550
teams team meeting yeah you'll be able

377
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,310
to see the timer and I would point out

378
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,400
that the timer is javascript-based and

379
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:03,610
if you switch away from the display and

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,490
then back again the timer does not keep

381
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,590
the correct time so if you have more

382
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,200
than one mural open and you switch

383
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,600
between them the timer gets out of sync

384
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,730
with the real world it's a little bit of

385
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,820
a bug in mural but I'm sure they'll fix

386
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:22,210
it at some point but ultimately having a

387
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:25,120
timer that you set on your phone for the

388
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,390
time boxes that are described will will

389
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,360
help a great deal and help us make sure

390
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,750
we keep on track and come back and we

391
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,470
don't have to chase everybody so much

392
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:40,780
quite often we extend the first exercise

393
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,020
the first time box we have a kind of

394
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,950
team-building exercise at the start and

395
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:50,170
we often extend it just because first

396
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,510
use of the tool people need a little bit

397
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,520
of extra time so I'm going to end that

398
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,320
timer and when the timer is up and it

399
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,600
will actually pop up a little message on

400
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,910
your screen that says time up it's not

401
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,820
super obvious but it's not super hidden

402
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,800
either and then we will go back to the

403
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,710
main room and maybe bring some of that

404
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:13,480
discussion that we've had back to every

405
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:16,500
in the organization so um in addition to

406
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,899
that we might do some voting quite often

407
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,850
we maybe come up with five or six ideas

408
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:22,779
for something and then we want to have a

409
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,850
vote on it

410
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:29,860
this is something that you can do in

411
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:31,659
your team rooms as well actually maybe

412
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,399
you can't but you're good edit rights

413
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,830
but you maybe can't do a voting session

414
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:38,830
that's a good point so ignore me and

415
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,830
that but we might do voting sessions as

416
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,520
a group so I will create a voting

417
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,270
session some thought I'll say how many

418
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,700
votes

419
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:53,500
everybody gets and I'll start that

420
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,149
voting session and you can see you can

421
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,549
click a card to add a vote and

422
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:59,740
shift-click to remove a vote and your

423
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,230
voting is anonymous and nobody else sees

424
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,440
your votes until the end and so we can

425
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,990
begin voting and I can add two votes to

426
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,250
one card one boat to another card and I

427
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,260
have no votes left and I can see how

428
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,750
we're getting on and maybe III don't

429
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,169
know it's a little bit anonymous who

430
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,659
vote car but um I can I can call out

431
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:25,149
that this three votes left from people

432
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:27,700
I'll give it a set amount of time and

433
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:29,440
then I will end the voting session and

434
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,230
when I end the voting session everybody

435
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,230
will see what are the stickies what are

436
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:37,840
the posts what are the items that

437
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:41,080
everybody's voted on this can be very

438
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:47,770
useful for facilitating classes and

439
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:50,919
agile agile training um okay so mural is

440
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:53,649
fairly straightforward this is the the

441
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,610
mural that I created just as a

442
00:22:53,649 --> 00:23:01,450
playground for students I usually do a

443
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:04,270
tech check before a class and I take

444
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:08,880
them through and live this type of

445
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:12,909
exercise which maybe maybe helps them

446
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:16,270
really understand what it is what it is

447
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:19,330
they need to do so I would very much

448
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,820
like to have that many of you in my

449
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,490
class ease

450
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:28,159
and I'm going to be sending this video

451
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:33,269
out to prospective students as a short

452
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,220
introduction and commit 23 minutes to to

453
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:37,710
to get started with both of those

454
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,710
capabilities logging into teams working

455
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:43,200
out with mural and then coming back to

456
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:47,279
the main group and all of the murals

457
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,100
will be PDF at the end of the class and

458
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:57,049
available for all of the students to go

459
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:57,049
down Lord it's a very powerful tool cool

460
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:06,460
so um that was really everything I had

461
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:11,740
for folks that was at teams and mural

462
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:15,790
I'm I'm hoping that that will make it a

463
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:18,750
little bit easier for you to get started

464
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,210
and either in one of my classes or

465
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:26,820
anybody else's classes or training where

466
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,820
they're using teams and mural
