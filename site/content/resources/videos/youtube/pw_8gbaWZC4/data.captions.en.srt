1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,120
one of the key aspects of a caman

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,519
strategy is improving the system

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,719
improving your workflow so after you've

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,200
defined what your workflow is you've

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:19,119
written down how you're going to uh work

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,400
your system and you've started actively

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,400
monitoring uh the work that is underway

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,359
you'll hopefully start seeing

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,280
patterns if we're using the metrics from

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,440
the flow metrics from a cand strategy

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,640
then we should be able to see when

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,920
things are sitting around for too long

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,440
and they're too old we should be able to

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,719
see patterns of delivery we should be

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,000
able to see um groupings of things that

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,239
are perhaps not quite where we expect

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,680
them to be on the graphs that we might

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,920
use to visualize that data and that

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,920
allows

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,400
us to ask more interesting questions it

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,920
allows us

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,840
to lift the carpet and see in the dark

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,320
see in the dark that's a great a cban

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,520
strategy is like

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:23,240
a torch shining the light in the

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,960
darkness of your system to see where

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,360
things are broken where things aren't

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,479
working as optimally as they could be to

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,000
see what's going on on where it would be

30
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,439
opaque normally um this is especially

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,360
true for teams doing scrum scrum has no

32
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,399
metrics at all um and the metrics that I

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,280
would always recommend would be the

34
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:50,960
caman flow metrics right because cban is

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,680
designed as something that can be used

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,039
to monitor any system it's a monitoring

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,159
tool it's not the system itself it's the

38
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,320
tool you use to observe the system think

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,799
about if you were building software and

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
you wanted to understand which features

41
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
of your product your customers were

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,599
using so that you could choose which

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
parts of the product to continue to

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,360
invest in and which not how would you do

45
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,840
that well you'd need to put some hooks

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,200
into your application and collect a

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,920
bunch of telemetry and then analyze the

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,519
data right so you can see what's going

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,160
on you need to increase transparency and

50
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,640
a cand strategy is that tool for any

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,360
system so regardless of whether scrum is

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,519
your system that might be your starting

53
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
point or that might be where you jump to

54
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,599
right you might start from over here but

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,840
you jump to scrum or you've got a system

56
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,720
that you just made up right that's

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,920
totally cool that's what lots of people

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,800
do we have a system that we just made up

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:59,319
then we can use

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,000
caman to gain insights and understanding

61
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,920
on what what's going on in this system

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,120
by monitoring it by collecting some

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,400
Telemetry on how our work happens so

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,879
that we can see better what's going on

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,239
it's it's it's I don't understand why

66
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,400
teams try

67
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,000
and manage their system from a position

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,959
of opacity right they can't see what's

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,480
going on they're looking into the fog of

70
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,400
war and they can't see the problems

71
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,959
and a cbad strategy and particularly the

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,720
flow metrics part of a cand strategy and

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,760
the visualization of the work remove

74
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
that fog of War so you can see what's

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,400
going on you can actually see when

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,799
things aren't working properly and it's

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
obvious look here's a problem here I can

78
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,519
see it it's visually triggering my brain

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,680
and I can see it so hopefully being able

80
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,120
to see all these problems will encourage

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,000
you to actually do something actually

82
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,799
make a change and we're effectively not

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,239
implementing a cand strategy of we're

84
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,079
not improving the workflow right imp

85
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,280
improving and making changes to the

86
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,879
system in order to see the numbers

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,799
change in a more positive or more

88
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:17,320
likable manner right so caman supports

89
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,320
continuous Improvement by giving you the

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,040
the the the torch to shine on the

91
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,280
problem The View through it's your radar

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
that lets you see through the fog of war

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,039
and be able to make better decisions if

94
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,320
you're struggling to create create a

95
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:36,520
pool based system of work then we can

96
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,600
help you we provide worldclass cand

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,800
training from Pro caman as well as

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,199
Consulting and coaching for teams trying

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,600
to implement a campan strategy if you're

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,600
a scrum team then I we always recommend

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,000
bringing in flow metrics as a

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,080
complimentary practice and have cbang

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,080
classes from scrum.org as well
