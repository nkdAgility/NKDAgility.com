While these are relevant to Product Developers' values, there is no explicit mention of Product Developers as a role or accountability. The discussion never addresses their structure, responsibilities, or collective accountability, and focuses instead on general ethical considerations in Scrum. The target audience likely includes practitioners (such as Product Developers), thus audience alignment is moderate-high.
