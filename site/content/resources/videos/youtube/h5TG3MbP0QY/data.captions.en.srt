1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:08,160
the most common thing I hear in the PSM

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,679
class is uh but in the real world

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,679
um and usually around the point when

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,820
we're talking about moral flexibility

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,199
and what we talk about in the uh the PSM

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,840
is the inflexibility of our moral

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,279
obligation to our customer to tell the

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,680
truth

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,579
and you hear many people in that class

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,559
say but in the real world we have to

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,680
tell our customer how long it will take

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,260
and how much it will cost up front

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
right and that the moral influx the

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,239
flexibility there is that that's a lie

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,820
right you just lied to your customer you

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,940
sold them a squirrel Burger

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,620
um a roadkill burger right it's not what

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,360
you just said it was and perhaps they

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,360
bought it based on that understanding
