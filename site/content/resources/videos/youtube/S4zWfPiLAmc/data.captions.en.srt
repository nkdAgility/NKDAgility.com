1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,720
one of the main ways to mess up the

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,519
implementation of your your cand

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,240
strategy and not get the value that

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,759
you're expecting IE we're doing better

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,240
than we were before is to is to not look

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,880
at the data right I I I see this in in

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,640
in team after team uh they say they're

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,240
doing

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
caman but all they have is a board with

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,519
some

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
columns they don't have any whip limit

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,440
um and that's it they just have a board

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,719
with some columns and they call it caman

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,640
I'm sorry to say but that is definitely

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,680
not enough to be uh Canan Canan strategy

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,559
right it's just not enough uh one of the

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,800
key things that they they miss out is is

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,440
not looking at the data or using vanity

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,039
metrics oh my goodness me the vanity

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,760
metrics coming up my ears uh uh story

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,239
points velocity uh burnd Downs W get rid

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,720
of all that crap it's terrible it's not

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,119
going to help you maximize the flow of

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,439
value for your customers it's not going

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,439
to help you um see what's going on

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,320
enough to be able to ask more

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,080
interesting questions that allow you to

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,640
change your process in order to optimize

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,159
it those metrics are not absolutely

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,280
absolutely not uh not good enough in

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,400
that story uh there are there are there

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,880
are four key metrics in cat

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,040
that you should be looking at um they're

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,880
all fairly straightforward easy to

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,840
collect most of us are using digital

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,640
tools today um so you you effectively

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,719
only need one piece of data well

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,200
technically two pieces of data for each

39
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,920
piece of work that flows through your

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,079
system um the date and time when it

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,920
started and the date and time when it

42
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,119
finished that's it those two pieces of

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,840
data if you're using jira if you're

44
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,880
using Azure devops if you're using

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Trello all of that data is collected for

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,759
you it's in there and you just need to

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,239
render it in a way that makes sense

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,280
so if it's started but not finished it's

49
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,040
part of your working process right

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,599
that's your whip right if it's started

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,319
uh but not finished you can also see how

52
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,480
old it is how long's it been sitting

53
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,560
there that's work item age um if it's

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,480
finished if it's crossed that Finish

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,000
Line you know uh how many items you've

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
delivered per unit of time right so over

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,480
each 30-day period how many items do we

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,800
deliver there you go we've got that

59
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,360
number by by just by virtue of that end

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,080
date and if you have the start date and

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,560
the end date you also have the cycle

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,440
time right how long it actually took uh

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
to deliver each of those items and then

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,360
you can do a bunch of math which is

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,560
pretty standardized um you can go or

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
look at a bunch of pieces of information

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,200
in that but without that

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
data you can't see what's going on right

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,760
transparency

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,599
inspection and adaption where's the

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,840
transparency if you don't have the data

72
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:09,239
or you decide to look at vanity metrics

73
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
or metrics that don't actually provide

74
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,799
you with anything actionable that's the

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,879
key it is the data what are you doing

76
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,879
with the data you're looking at how you

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,159
changing the way you work based on the

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,720
outcome of that data if you're not

79
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,040
you're either not doing it or you're not

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,080
looking at the right data because the

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,319
data is not telling you something that

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,239
helps you

83
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,319
change stop looking at back data as part

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,519
of your cband strategy stop looking at

85
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,239
vanity metrics and improve your process

86
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,680
if you're struggling to implement a

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,760
cband strategy we can help or help you
