 📊 If You Can’t See Your Flow, You Can’t Improve It
🎥 Episode 7 of 10 — From Legacy to Engineering Excellence with Azure DevOps

You're building products.
You’re making decisions.
But here’s the hard truth:

📉 If you’re not tracking real data—you're just guessing.

✅ Lead time
✅ Cycle time
✅ WIP limits
✅ Flow efficiency

These are the signals that actually show how your teams are working. And yet—most teams still rely on gut feel.

🔍 Built-in telemetry from every work item
📈 Basic metrics like lead time, cycle time, cumulative flow
🧠 Full data access via APIs + Power BI for custom dashboards
⚙️ Third-party tools like FlowViz (free) and ActionableAgile (powerful) for clarity at scale
