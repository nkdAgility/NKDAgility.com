1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
If you're building products um at any

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,839
scale, whether it's small scale or large

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,880
scale, it's really important to make

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,719
decisions based on actual evidence. And

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
that evidence can come in the form of

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,119
hypothesisdriven practices at the

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,000
business level, at the value level, or

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,880
it can come all the way down to to flow

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,160
metrics at the delivery level. And

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,800
that's one thing that I I would probably

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,519
say Azure DevOps is a little bit

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,239
rudimentary in that space out of the

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:39,440
box, but we can absolutely get those

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:43,440
things and augment those things. Um so

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,879
one of the fundamental um

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,520
understandings that I've gained over

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,320
many years of building software and

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
helping teams build software is without

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,559
visibility, you can't see what's going

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,079
on. And without being able to see what's

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
going on, you can't make effective

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
changes. And you also can't see the

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,320
impact

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
and effect of those changes on the way

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,840
that you work.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,560
So we need telemetry. We need data. Does

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,360
some of that telemetry comes from your

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
product, right? Building uh um open

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,840
telemetry into your product, collecting

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,360
specific and deliberate telemetry from

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,920
your product. Um but we can also use

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,560
telemetry on the way that we work and

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,680
Azure DevOps is a fantastic system for

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,520
gathering gathering that telemetry. Um

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,560
so in Azure DevOps um every value of

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,360
every variable that ever was inside of

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,000
your work items is collected and stored.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,320
Okay. So um it doesn't matter what field

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,680
it is. If you add a custom field, no

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,000
problem. The full history of that field

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,119
um is available uh within the context.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,759
So that allows you to pull and collect

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,640
any sort of data you like in any way you

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,439
like. Okay. Uh that's the powerful part,

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,920
right? All of that data is there. Um the

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,879
visualizations that are built into Azure

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
DevOps, we can they're they're a little

48
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,280
bit rudimentary, but that's that's

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,440
fundamentally Microsoft's premise,

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,000
right? Microsoft's premise is we're not

51
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,120
going to build everything for you. We're

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,440
going to build the data layer, the API

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
layer, and then we'll build some

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,800
examples of here's what you can do with

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,360
that data that that that meet the table

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,319
stakes. We'll build the table stakes and

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,080
then let partners um build the the the

58
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,440
value ads that are specific to your

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,480
organization. So I work with customers

60
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,160
that have a large internal ecosystem of

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,360
custom

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,760
boards, controls, dashboards that they

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
build internally and ship around the

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,360
organization. So they have an

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,599
engineering team who builds

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
augmentations for Azure DevOps. They

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,440
support other teams who build

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,200
augmentations for themselves in Azure

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
DevOps and allow those to be shared

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
across the organization. And Azure

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
DevOps has has capabilities for that as

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
well, right? That's for people that are

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
really big. If you're really big, you

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
can absolutely do that. If you're really

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,159
small, you don't want to have to do

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,440
that. You want some vendor uh uh to do

77
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,440
that for you and you you absolutely um

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
have that capability. So there's a

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
couple of things that you can do within

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,360
the context of of Azure DevOps. So out

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,760
of the box, it does have h lead time and

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,319
cycle time. Okay. And there's a little

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,080
bit of work in process. So, at the top

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,239
of your columns on your your boards,

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,840
uh the board uh the I guess they're

86
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
called Carban boards, right? But they're

87
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
not really they're just boards. The on

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
the top of the boards, they have a a

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,080
whip limit. It is not enforced. It will

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,080
just go red if you go over the limit.

91
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,159
And the limit is for each column. They

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,200
don't have a system limit, right? So,

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
that's a limitation. They don't have a

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
system limit, just a limit for the for

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,519
each column.

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,680
uh you can add uh cycle time and lead

97
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,959
time to the the dashboards and it will

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,080
give you a hover over uh view of your

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,400
average just the average uh cycle time

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
and lead time. Um I don't like the

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,759
average. I like the 85th percentile and

102
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,359
it should have all of them but it

103
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
doesn't. So that's what I mean by

104
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,479
sometimes it's a little bit basic and

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,520
rudimentary. It's opinionated. They pick

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,040
one thing. Uh so they have they have uh

107
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,360
that but you can hover over individual

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,600
items and see see where they are and

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
then they have a cumulative flow right

110
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,240
which is again straightforward just

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
visualizes the the cumulative flow

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
that's out of the box you get that for

113
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,199
free uh Microsoft is opinionated on when

114
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
work items start and when work items

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,600
finish. That's beyond the scope of this

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,240
but um we can we can definitely talk

117
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,360
about that in another another video. Um

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400
but there are all of all of that data

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,400
that they use to make that is stored in

120
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,680
the system. So you can access the APIs

121
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,000
and access the PowerBI the analytics. So

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,240
everything be loaded into PowerBI and

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
build whatever graphs you want. Right?

124
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
So that's one. But if you're small

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,800
enough, you don't want to build it

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,000
yourself. Um, I recommend two, there's

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,479
two, um, tools that I definitely

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,560
recommend taking a look at. Uh, one is

129
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,280
called Flow Viz, and that's effectively

130
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,919
some pre-built PowerBI reports that you

131
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,759
can load in to your to your PowerBI

132
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
environment. It connects to Azure DevOps

133
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,240
and pulls your data and displays all of

134
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,199
the cool stuff. And it's free, right?

135
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,600
Flow Viz uh, gives you that capability.

136
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
Great. Go try it out. uh download it,

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,240
install it. The other one is actionable

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,720
agile metrics for predictability. So

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,440
actionable actual is a plugin, an

140
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,160
interactive javascriptbased, no data

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,280
goes anywhere but your system uh uh

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,160
plugin, but it's $20 per user per month.

143
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,880
I recommend that one, too. That's what I

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,199
use because I just want an easy visual

145
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,560
indication uh that I can just add a

146
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,240
plugin to to Azure DevOps and go spelunk

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,360
people's uh people's data. So um that

148
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,840
get both of those tools give you much

149
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
more accurate accurate is probably the

150
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,520
wrong word but much much better much

151
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,479
more more features many more features uh

152
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
for for lead time cycle time for

153
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,400
percentiles

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
um for seeing your work in process

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,160
seeing your your flow. I particularly

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,039
like in actionable agile it has a view

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,639
uh which is work in progress and you can

158
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,400
see the overlay of your percentiles on

159
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
your work in process. So you can see the

160
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,840
things that are much

161
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,840
which are most likely to be in danger uh

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,960
within that context. So using Azure

163
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,479
DevOps you get all access to all of the

164
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,440
data and some visualizations. then

165
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,800
bringing in some third party tools. Uh

166
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,680
on top of that, you can make it really

167
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,680
light up and create any sort of data

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,039
visualizations you want. If you're a

169
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,120
coder, uh Ben also has a I think it's

170
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,919
called the um Azure DevOps admin tools.

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
He has a little uh command line toolkit

172
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,759
uh that you can run that will get you

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
most of the data as well and give you

174
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,039
your cycle time, leak time, build your

175
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,120
graphs, all of those things from the

176
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,960
from the command line. Um so if you're

177
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
developer, you can you can use that, but

178
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,680
it's not as friendly for for everybody

179
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,160
else that might be using the system. So

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
I if if

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
with all of these options, it can be a

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,720
little bit difficult to navigate. So if
