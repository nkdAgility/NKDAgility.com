    "description": "In this video, I delve into the innovative immersive learning program that’s designed to bring real change to your product development process. Unlike traditional training, this program isn't just about delivering content—it's about engaging deeply with that content over a longer period of time. This approach allows participants to not only learn new tools, techniques, and philosophies but also to apply them directly within their own organizations, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\n\nYou'll learn how outcome-based assignments encourage you to take what you've learned and immediately test it in your real-world environment, with your real products and teams. By fostering ongoing reflection and discussion, this immersive program helps participants to understand and question their current practices, drive meaningful conversations within their organizations, and ultimately lead to more effective and value-driven product development.
