1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,799
so the new immersive learning program

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:10,639
for that we apply to pretty much

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:16,920
everything we do now is uh designed

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:20,760
around this idea of um not not just

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,359
imparting knowledge right not just uh uh

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,119
going through some

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:28,480
content but it's an immersive format

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,840
where we have

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,399
um the content delivered over a much

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,879
longer period of time so we have a

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,079
structured program over a much longer

12
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,320
period of time and it includes some

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,800
learning right we want to learn some new

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,800
things some new tools some new

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,559
techniques some new philosophies some

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,559
new ideas um but at the end of each of

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,840
those learning learning

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,199
sessions even though we've done some

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,120
exercises perhaps practical exercises

20
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,560
demonstrating how it might work within

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,680
the context of of the learning right um

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,680
we use we use liberating structures to

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,880
help uh um create smaller groups and

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,439
have people figure out how to use the

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,079
knowledge but it's still within the

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,920
context of a of of

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,439
of still within the context of that

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,240
group of people right it's not out in

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,119
your real organization it's not out with

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,840
your real product and your real teams

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,399
and your real customers so at the end of

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,799
each kind of learning learning session

33
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,680
where we learn something new um we have

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,840
a we have an assignment and That is an

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,119
outcome based assignment the idea is

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,520
that for each assignment we're trying to

37
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:54,399
achieve something so for example um I

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,920
just had the third session of the

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:03,079
product management um Mentor program for

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,600
uh a a company in in Sri Lanka and their

41
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,640
product managers we we talked about

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,680
value with the product managers um The

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,160
Learning the piece the new information I

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
was providing for them was here's how

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
you can think about value here's how you

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,519
can understand value here's how you can

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
potentially measure value so we talked

48
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,720
about evidence based management we well

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,760
we talked about the value pyramid then

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,640
we talked about evidence based

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,080
management um and we talked about other

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,760
metrics and uh stories around that and

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,360
even people kind of because we were

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,840
talking about metrics they started to

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
bring up other questions around you know

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,440
answering that a old question when will

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,800
it be done so we talked a little bit

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,640
about just a little bit about

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,239
probabilistic forecasting um and flow

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,120
metrics as well right so they drove the

61
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,640
learning content as well as me having a

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,519
plan for for what I would like them to

63
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,239
understand and then the outcome based

64
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,480
assignment the assignment that they've

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,080
got

66
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,080
is to go

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,080
apply that to their organization like

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,799
what what

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,080
metrics go out into your organization

70
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,680
and figure out what metrics do you

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,959
currently use in your

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,440
organization how what do you collect how

73
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,239
do you use them and how does it impact

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,080
on decision making right that's that's

75
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,000
their that's that's the the kind of core

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,519
part of their assignment is to go

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,560
understand what it is company has and

78
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,040
what the company's doing but

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,360
then in addition to that perhaps they

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,200
should start a conversation about do we

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
have the right metrics is is is there a

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,400
simpler way to collect the thing we're

83
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,599
trying to achieve can we optimize this

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,640
and start having those

85
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,799
conversations so the

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,720
outcome from that that I'm trying to

87
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,400
achieve is that they as a group so this

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,480
was this was about six 16 product

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,319
managers for one company they as a group

90
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,120
either in small groups go off and have

91
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,079
those conversations as individuals have

92
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,840
those conversations or they can do it

93
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,079
all together I I I leave it up to them

94
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,600
but when they come back and we're doing

95
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,600
our facilitated Reflections we're going

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,560
the idea that I'm trying to achieve is

97
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,120
that

98
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,960
they they understand more about what it

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
is that their product does and and how

100
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,400
does it work and what they're trying to

101
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,120
achieve with it because they've looked

102
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,360
at how they're measuring their success

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,800
they've looked at how they're measuring

104
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,800
their capability to deliver the product

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,199
um and then

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,520
they're thinking about whether those are

107
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,039
the right things they should be looking

108
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,000
at right because a lot of the time in

109
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,759
organizations we're looking at the wrong

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
things we're looking at the wrong data

111
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,120
we perhaps have vanity metrics uh

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,120
metrics that look great uh you know like

113
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,840
velocity or story points but don't

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
actually add any value to the

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,639
conversation you know we've managed to

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,880
get our our original estimate and our

117
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,400
actuals within you know 10% of each

118
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,000
other we're awesome yeah but what value

119
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,720
does that PR provide to the organization

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,800
does it actually provide any greater

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,479
degree of predictability does it

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,680
actually help the organization

123
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,840
understand when things will be done um

124
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,240
and the answer is no but trying to

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,880
trying to figure out uh

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,560
and have those conversations so they're

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,039
starting to have those conversations

128
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,960
within the organization not just within

129
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,759
themselves but with other people within

130
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,720
the organization so they're starting

131
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,400
that conversation generally in the

132
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,280
organization and then when we come back

133
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,360
for the next session which is usually a

134
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:50,400
week later a week or two weeks later

135
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,039
depending on the the what it is we're

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,479
doing when we come back for that

137
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,440
reflective uh

138
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,160
session they're

139
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,319
explaining what what it is they did what

140
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,000
they managed to learn um what they

141
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,680
discovered in their organization as they

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,880
were doing those things

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,840
and really sharing with not just with

144
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,080
each

145
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,280
other

146
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,120
but I can help provide them with

147
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,120
potential directions that they could

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,880
take if things weren't working for them

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,039
or if things were working well what

150
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
might be possible next steps that they

151
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,199
could try

152
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,759
and hopefully over time they're able to

153
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,560
figure out a lot of those things

154
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,840
themselves right when you start from a

155
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,280
position of not necessarily

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,919
understanding something not doing it not

157
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,199
knowing that you have to do it and not

158
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,080
knowing what you're trying to achieve

159
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,400
with it you need that kind of

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,039
facilitated reflection to start thinking

161
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,400
about what value it brings as you start

162
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,800
understanding the value that the the

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,520
outcome that we're trying to to achieve

164
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,680
and the value it provides to you and

165
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,479
your business you start getting more

166
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,400
engaged with that topic you start poking

167
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:17,160
at it and pulling it threads and trying

168
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,919
to figure that out so this idea of um

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,440
immersive immersive learning right

170
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,400
immersive uh the immersive program so we

171
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,000
we apply it both to our training classes

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,040
and to our uh mentorship programs that

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,479
you have this

174
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,240
[Music]

175
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,039
um these these

176
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,800
outcomes which will hopefully enable

177
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
changes within your organization so

178
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,759
there's no there's no guarantees for

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,840
anything right absolutely no guarantees

180
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,280
for anything your organization could

181
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:54,159
completely ignore everything you're

182
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,960
trying to do but I find that this type

183
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,800
of

184
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,639
Engagement has the best chance of impact

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,039
because the par ipants are able to go

186
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,120
start that conversation and then come

187
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,960
back and we can all share ideas on why

188
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
did that not work why did people ignore

189
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,560
you why did they dismiss what it was

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
that you said I I've had product

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,479
managers come back and they've been told

192
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,759
stay in your lane right this this is

193
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,280
this is above your pay grade you know

194
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,759
this is you need to stay out of this

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,919
when in fact it's something that

196
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,680
somebody who is a product manager should

197
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:28,919
be heavily involved in and heavily

198
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,279
engaged in where do the requirements

199
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,680
come from right

200
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:38,399
so each of those assignments is designed

201
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,800
to be a catalyst for change within the

202
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,919
organization through conversation and

203
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,040
discussion within that

204
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,200
organization and what we want to be able

205
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,480
to do is enable the teams and people

206
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,200
within the organization to be able to

207
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,959
become more effective right by having

208
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,760
those conversations discussing those

209
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,760
things hopefully we'll even make small

210
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,519
changes or at least plant the seeds for

211
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,440
changes and then start them growing over

212
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,760
multiple sessions right because we come

213
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,120
back around on on similar topics to

214
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,040
reinforce them um and that should enable

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,680
teams and people within the organization

216
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,240
to become more effective and be able to

217
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,839
focus more effectively on the goals that

218
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,000
they're trying to achieve and hopefully

219
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,120
have better outcomes for for their team

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,200
for the people for the organization and

221
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,200
for the business
