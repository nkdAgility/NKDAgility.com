It highlights maximizing value, gathering feedback, updating the backlog, engaging stakeholders, and aligning on product goals—concepts that align with 'Customer Focus.' However, it does not directly discuss measuring outcomes or anchoring decisions on customer evidence. While customer value is implicit, direct references are sparse, and discussion stays at the practice/process level rather than deep exploration of customer outcomes or value definitions. The main audience matches agile practitioners, and most content is relevant, but there's light filler (call to action, self-promotion). No penalties apply as content is current and supportive.",
