1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,620
so who should lead the Sprint review at

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,940
why and how I think that's a great

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,599
question

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,880
um

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,980
I'll start with the purpose of the

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,779
Sprint review right

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,080
um the purpose of the Sprint review is

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,180
to get the best possible information

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,859
from the stakeholders in order to

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,140
maximize the value of the next Sprint

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,060
right the product backlog is in the best

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
possible State it's got all of the

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,800
things that we need in it we've absorbed

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,200
the the the we've we've brought together

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,360
the information from you know what we've

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
done in the last two weeks in the

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,840
product what's happened in the last two

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,700
weeks in the business what's happened in

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,200
the last two weeks in the market and

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,120
we're mushing that together and actually

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,680
updating the product backlog so when we

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,280
walk out of Sprint planning we have that

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,620
updated as up-to-date as we can as

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,379
effective as we can put it backlog so we

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,039
maximize the value that we deliver

26
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,539
um so then the question of of of who is

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,240
to lead it

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,220
who on the scrum team is accountable for

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,200
for Value delivery for maximizing the

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,140
value of the work done by the scrum team

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,939
product owner right

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,220
so I would normally expect the product

33
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,340
owner to be the one

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,380
um leading the Sprint review I mean it

35
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,540
can be anybody on the team I have no

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,140
problem with that right but the product

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,659
owner is the accountable party uh for

38
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,200
maximizing the value of the work done so

39
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:38,040
it's in their best interest to make sure

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,900
or enable the the Sprint review is as

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,640
valuable as possible and quite often

42
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,159
that means they are the facilitator

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,560
right they are the ones who are getting

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,600
the most out of it right because that's

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,979
their accountability they're ensuring

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,159
their accountability

47
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,299
so perhaps they should create the the

48
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,960
the

49
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,360
um

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,759
the flow of the Sprint review what do

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,439
you if you're a product owner what do

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,280
you need from your stakeholders this

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,840
Sprint

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,460
right that's what you're trying to get

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,220
to how are you going to create and

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,660
organize that event so that you maximize

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
the chance of you getting the

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,780
information that you need

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,819
um in the time that you need it having

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,440
the conversations that you need during

61
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,620
that event

62
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,900
um so so how do you run it wow that any

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,180
way you like as long as you get to the

64
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,520
outcome right I don't really care how

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,840
you run it so some teams do demos some

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,300
teams don't do demos right because

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,959
they're already in production

68
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,239
uh perhaps a flow that I kind of like

69
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,940
um I have it documented on my on my

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,620
website but I flow I kind of like is you

71
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,480
need to use you know the product owner

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,860
should be should be setting the scene at

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,280
the start right what's the current

74
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,900
vision of of the product let's reset

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
this is what we're talking about is the

76
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,680
vision that's what we're trying to get

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,700
towards what's the current product goal

78
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,099
right what's our our current

79
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,440
short-term uh or intermediate strategic

80
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,120
goal that we're trying to get to

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
um and then what was our tactical goal

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,620
this Sprint what was it that were

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,140
actually actually focused on that what's

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,940
the the outcome that we told the

85
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,640
stakeholders at the beginning the

86
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,040
singular Sprint goal what's the outcome

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,360
that we're gonna we're gonna focus on

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,640
and then perhaps the team do a a demo

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
showing you know what it was what's what

90
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,120
we created in the last two weeks that's

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,159
pretty cool

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,159
um but also we need to get feedback on

93
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,080
that demo that's almost uh more

94
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,879
important than anything else is getting

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,099
feedback on that demo

96
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,200
um but then that's if that's the end of

97
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,000
your Sprint review then you're missing

98
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,680
out on a lot of extra stuff because

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,319
perhaps we need to have a conversation

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,599
about yeah we need to have a

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,299
conversation about what's happened in

102
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,680
the business what the stakeholders are

103
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,180
coming to bring information what

104
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,280
information can we get out of the

105
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,840
stakeholders about things that are

106
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,159
coming up in the future things that

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,440
might be talked about in the business

108
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,260
changes in the market that we can bring

109
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,120
into our our story

110
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,459
um and all the whole throughout this we

111
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,280
need to be actually updating the product

112
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,879
backlog so I think there's there's lots

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,100
of ways to run that but those are the

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,699
key information PCS that we need to get

115
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,759
by the end of it so run it however you

116
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,000
like whoever you like can facilitate it

117
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,979
but ultimately the accountability we're

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,020
fulfilling here is the product owners
