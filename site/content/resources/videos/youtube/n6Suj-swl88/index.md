The [Sprint Review]({{< ref "/tags/sprint-review" >}}): Who Should Lead and Why It Matters

As I reflect on my experiences with [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}), one question that often arises is: who should lead the Sprint Review? This is a pivotal moment in our Agile journey, and understanding its purpose is crucial for maximising the value we deliver in the next Sprint.

### The Purpose of the Sprint Review

At its core, the Sprint Review is about gathering the best possible information from stakeholders. This ensures that our [product backlog]({{< ref "/tags/product-backlog" >}}) is in the best possible state, ready to guide our next steps. Here’s what we aim to achieve:

- **Absorb Information**: We need to synthesise what we've accomplished over the last two weeks, alongside insights from the business and market.
- **Update the Product Backlog**: By the end of the review, our backlog should reflect the most current and relevant information, setting us up for success in the next Sprint.

### Who Should Lead the Sprint Review?

Now, let’s tackle the question of [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}). Who is accountable for delivering value? The answer is clear: the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}). 

- **Accountability**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximising the value of the work done by the [Scrum Team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}). This makes them the ideal candidate to lead the Sprint Review.
- **Facilitation**: While anyone on the team can facilitate the review, it’s often the Product Owner who is best positioned to extract valuable insights from stakeholders. They have a vested interest in ensuring the review is as productive as possible.

### Structuring the Sprint Review

So, how do we run an effective Sprint Review? The beauty of Agile is that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. Here are some key elements I recommend:

1. **Set the Scene**: The Product Owner should start by reiterating the current vision of the product. This helps everyone align on what we’re working towards.
   
2. **Define Goals**: Clarify the current product goal and the tactical goal for the Sprint. What were we aiming to achieve? This sets the context for the discussions that follow.

3. **Showcase Progress**: If applicable, a demo of what was created during the Sprint can be incredibly valuable. This is not just about showing off; it’s about engaging stakeholders and gathering feedback.

4. **Encourage Feedback**: The feedback we receive during the demo is often more important than the demo itself. It’s our opportunity to learn and adapt.

5. **Discuss Future Directions**: Use this time to converse about what’s happening in the business and market. What insights can stakeholders share that might influence our future work?

6. **Update the Backlog**: Throughout the review, ensure that the product backlog is being updated with new information and insights. This is crucial for maintaining its relevance.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the Product Owner is typically the one leading the Sprint Review, the format can be flexible. The key is to ensure that we’re fulfilling our accountability to maximise value. 

I encourage you to experiment with different structures and approaches to find what works best for your team. Remember, the goal is to leave the Sprint Review with a clear, updated product backlog and a shared understanding of our next steps.
