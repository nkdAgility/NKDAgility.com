You can't measure understanding. You just can't measure it. You can't say, "Here's a line in the sand," and at this point, everybody understands it. It's a lot more nebulous than that, a lot more fuzzy than that. So you, as a product owner, need to learn to read the room, to know what language you need to use in order to enable understanding, to know what sometimes people don't want to admit that they don't understand your thing. Right? So you need to learn to be able to read when people are in that category and maybe do some more around it.
