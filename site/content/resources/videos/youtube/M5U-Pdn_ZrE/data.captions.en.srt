1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,919
you can't measure understanding right

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,760
you just can't measure it you can't say

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,320
here's a Line in the Sand and at this

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,759
point everybody understands it it's a

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,480
lot more nebulous than that a lot more

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,119
fuzzy than that so you as a product

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,960
owner need to learn to to read the room

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,000
to to to know what language you need to

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,519
use in order to enable understanding to

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,519
know what what sometimes people don't

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,760
want to admit that they don't

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,760
understand your thing right so you need

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
to learn to be able to read when when

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,800
people are in that category and and

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,800
