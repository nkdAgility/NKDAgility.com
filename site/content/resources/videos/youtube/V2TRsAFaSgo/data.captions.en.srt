1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,279
are legacy contracts keeping you stuck

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,200
with the wrong vendors you're not alone

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,280
Vendor lockin is a real issue for

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,400
organizations trying to modernize their

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,639
systems of work It happens when outdated

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
contracts proprietary platforms or

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,279
deeply embedded dependencies make it

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,039
nearly impossible to shift Instead of

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
focusing on what's best for your

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
business you're trapped maintaining

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,760
somebody else's business model So how to

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,279
break free first let's talk about why it

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,600
matters Sticking with the wrong vendors

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,320
doesn't just slow you down it limits

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,320
your ability to adapt You're forced to

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
work within their constraints whether

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,360
that's rigid licensing slow innovation

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,320
cycles or overpriced services that no

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,680
longer align with your needs At Naked

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,680
Agility we don't sell tools We help

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
organizations make sense of their

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
systems of work the way teams

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,600
collaborate plan and deliver value

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
Because the real issue isn't just the

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,000
software you're using it's how decisions

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,159
are being

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,720
made Breaking vendor lockin isn't about

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,439
swapping one system for another It's

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,080
about making better choices Choices that

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,280
give you flexibility control and the

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
ability to adapt as your business

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,360
evolves We work with teams to understand

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
their real constraints whether that's

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,240
technical contractual or organizational

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
Then we guide them through pragmatic

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,600
step-by-step transitions towards more

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
open adaptable solutions This isn't

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
about throwing everything out and

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,000
starting over It's about untangling

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,840
dependencies enabling better decision-m

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,560
and creating options instead of dead

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,640
ends If you're feeling stuck the first

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,040
step isn't buying another tool It's

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,439
understanding the choices you actually

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
have Let's start a conversation
