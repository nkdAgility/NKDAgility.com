Are legacy contracts keeping you stuck with the wrong vendors? You're not alone. Vendor lock-in is a real issue for organizations trying to modernize their systems of work. It happens when outdated contracts, proprietary platforms, or deeply embedded dependencies make it nearly impossible to shift.

Instead of focusing on what's best for your business, you're trapped maintaining somebody else's business model. So how to break free? First, let's talk about why it matters. Sticking with the wrong vendors doesn't just slow you down, it limits your ability to adapt. You're forced to work within their constraints, whether that's rigid licensing, slow innovation cycles, or overpriced services that no longer align with your needs.

We don't sell tools. We help organizations make sense of their systems of work—the way teams collaborate, plan, and deliver value. Because the real issue isn't just the software you're using, it's how decisions are being made.

Breaking vendor lock-in isn't about swapping one system for another. It's about making better choices—choices that give you flexibility, control, and the ability to adapt as your business evolves. We work with teams to understand their real constraints, whether that's technical, contractual, or organizational. Then we guide them through pragmatic, step-by-step transitions towards more open, adaptable solutions.

This isn't about throwing everything out and starting over. It's about untangling dependencies, enabling better decision-making, and creating options instead of dead ends.

If you're feeling stuck, the first step isn't buying another tool. It's understanding the choices you actually have. Let's start a conversation.
