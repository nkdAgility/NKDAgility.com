1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,240
scrum is like communism it doesn't

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:12,200
work this is a phrase I hear often from

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,440
folks who have been unable to adapt

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,000
their systems of work to incorporate the

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,720
core philosophies theories and practices

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,560
of scrum they sit and look at the

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,720
signals coming from scrum that things

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,800
are broken and don't work like they're

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:33,759
supposed to work and do nothing but say

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,759
scrum is like communism it doesn't

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,920
[Music]

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,520
work hi I'm Martin Henwood owner and

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,239
principal consultant at naked agility

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,160
scrum.org a professional caman trainer

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,199
with Pro caman and I've been a Microsoft

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,199
MVP in GitHub and as your devops for 15

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,199
years

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,439
in this video we'll explore five myths

20
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,400
from scrum that inhibit its adoption

21
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,280
from language definition inflation to

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,000
cognitive bias here are the top five

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,479
myths that result in the idea that scrum

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
is like

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,240
communism there's a myth in scrum that

26
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,920
you spend more time talking than doing I

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,119
see this quite a lot people talking you

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,159
usually people are using old school

29
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,200
terminology when you hear them talking

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,119
about that you hear them talking about

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,280
ceremonies right rather than events and

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,079
one of the main reasons why scrum

33
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,280
doesn't call the the activities the

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,960
events ceremonies is because it's

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
ceremonies we get together and nothing

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,520
happens it's a ceremony it's something

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,399
we do that's perhaps the same every time

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
and there's no actual outcome to a

39
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,240
ceremony apart from maybe people have

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,599
some jollies and they feel good right um

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,760
the reason scrum calls them events and

42
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,680
also not meetings the reason they're

43
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,840
called events is something's supposed to

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,040
happen

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,200
there every single one of the scrum

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,640
events serves

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,640
empiricism that's their purpose right

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,239
you're going to inspect something and

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,040
that adapt

50
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,599
something if you're not

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,560
adapting there's no point in being there

52
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,680
there's no point in having it there's no

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,120
point in doing it their purpose is to

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,560
adapt so for example at your Sprint

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,879
planning you're inspecting your product

56
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,040
backlog and your product goal and you're

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,120
adapting your Sprint backlog and your

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,879
Sprint goal you that emerges through

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
that con perhaps through that

60
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,319
conversation

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,720
right but at the end of your Sprint

62
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:10,319
planning you should have a Sprint

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,200
goal you should have selected backlog

64
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,200
items what do the developers think best

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,319
serves working towards the product goal

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,239
and you should have some kind of a

67
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,040
starter plan to complete them if those

68
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,560
three things don't exist at the end of

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Sprint planning there was no point in

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
having it that's what it's there for so

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
that we understand what it is we're

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,360
going to take into the next Sprint so

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,560
that we can communicate that perhaps

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
with other people what's our goal for

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,720
this Sprint what are we trying to

76
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,200
achieve how do you get the stakeholders

77
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,599
to actually turn up for the Sprint

78
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,400
review well you have to give them

79
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,439
something that they're interested in

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,560
coming in providing feedback on that's

81
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:55,079
your Sprint goal right and that's just

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,200
one of the events in scrum every sing

83
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,360
your daily scrum it's only 15 minutes

84
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,720
how does that add up to a boatload of

85
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:10,159
meetings at most 15 minutes per day

86
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,319
where the team gets together and plans

87
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,400
the next 24 hours that's its purpose

88
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,400
you're inspecting your existing Sprint

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,759
back

90
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,280
clog and you're adapting that Sprint

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
back clog based on what you learned in

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,680
the last 24 hours you might have learn

93
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,040
some stuff from actually working on the

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,360
product what can and cannot be done you

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,880
might have uh a gained more information

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,759
and insight from other stakeholders and

97
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,320
collaborating with the business and

98
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,000
doing analysis on what it is you're

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,639
going to work on that means that

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,960
something that you've got in the Sprint

101
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,720
needs to be taken out because it's no

102
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
longer viable or something else needs to

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,160
be brought in because it becomes part of

104
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,520
that that story of what it is you're

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,840
trying to achieve that

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Sprint that's your daily

107
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,639
scrum right it's not an elaborate status

108
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,240
event it's not a time that you're

109
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,160
wasting it's where you're maintaining

110
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,560
the transparency that is required to be

111
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,240
able to inspect and adapt you're serving

112
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,039
empiricism and all of the scrum events

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,039
serve

114
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:24,560
empiricism one of the common uh myths in

115
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,199
scrum um is kind of a a a proxy myth

116
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,319
this proxy myth is you know why do we

117
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,960
spend so much time working on story

118
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,080
points

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
um when story points measure complexity

120
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,479
and not time and then we have to figure

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,400
out how many story points fit in a

122
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,000
Sprint right and I I 100% agree with

123
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,880
that that part is not a myth the bit

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,479
that's a myth is that story points are

125
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,520
even a scrum thing in the first place

126
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,479
they're not story points has nothing to

127
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,720
do with scrum it never has apart from as

128
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,800
a practice potentially complimentary PR

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,120
practice that teams choose to take on in

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,960
order to get to an

131
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,400
outcome when you find complimentary

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,759
practices are not adding value you

133
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,599
should be stopping doing them not

134
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,479
continuing with them so if you're in

135
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:21,880
that position where you find that story

136
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,319
points are not adding value great stop

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,520
doing them and choose something else

138
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,680
choose a different way the guy that

139
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,319
invented story points or that is

140
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,639
generally accredited with inventing

141
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:40,199
story points has a public apology online

142
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,240
for creating them in the first place

143
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,759
because of how they are tend to be used

144
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,800
within organizations as a pseudo proxy

145
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,400
for time to beat developers around the

146
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,720
head with right they were originally

147
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,160
invented as a reasonable way for

148
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,240
developers to sit and have a

149
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,720
conversation

150
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,800
and find out figure out what they don't

151
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,240
know that's the purpose in story points

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,879
we can all get together we maybe use

153
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,919
another complimentary practice called

154
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,680
planning poker and all that really is is

155
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,800
we we keep our cards to ourselves right

156
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,879
we we're not going to tell each other

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,560
what story point we're going to pick how

158
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,160
complex t-shirt sizes right whatever you

159
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,039
pick how complex this thing is and

160
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,960
you've got one developer that that says

161
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,479
this is a small or a one right you've

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,000
got four developers that say that this

163
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
is a five or a medium and then you've

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,919
got one developer that says this is an

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:50,800
extra large or a 21 right and the idea

166
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,080
is what do they know that we don't or

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,720
what do we know that they

168
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,919
don't that's the

169
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,280
purpose of story points and complexity

170
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:05,159
conversation

171
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:08,400
it should be used almost solely during

172
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,800
refinement in order to enable teams to

173
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,319
rightsize their backlog items and decide

174
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,720
do they fit in a Sprint do we understand

175
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,240
them or do we

176
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,479
not after that delete the numbers

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,560
they're

178
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,240
useless don't use them anymore that's

179
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,950
their purpose for that one context don't

180
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,639
bring them into the wider context

181
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:34,039
[Music]

182
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,760
one of the common uh myths in scrum is

183
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,800
that is really a a forum for

184
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,279
micromanagement and the the there's a

185
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,159
there's a core test for this in your

186
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,839
team it is it is a myth right but it's a

187
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:50,440
reality for many teams so is it a myth

188
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,720
or is it not a myth that is a matter of

189
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,600
perspective however I would point out

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,519
that it's not scrum so it's a myth in

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,240
the context of scrum but it's not a myth

192
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,800
in the context of how lots of

193
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,279
organizations and teams approach scrum

194
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,040
because most organizations approach

195
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:12,600
something like scrum from their

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:16,760
traditional topdown steering based

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,200
perspective and they want to tell teams

198
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,000
what they're going to deliver in a

199
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,120
Sprint so you walk into Sprint

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,839
planning and the product owner or the

201
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:32,800
tech lead or the project manager or

202
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,160
whoever the scrum Master the worst one

203
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
but the scrum Master says here's a list

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,720
of things we need you as a team to do

205
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,959
this

206
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,480
Sprint as soon as that happens not

207
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,320
scrum we've gone out of the bounds of

208
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,519
the scrum guide who decides what we work

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,760
on this Sprint the developers who

210
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,440
decides how we work on it the

211
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,200
developers okay it's not anybody else

212
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,440
because the de developers that's this

213
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,760
this core reason why they dislike that

214
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,560
approach it's the developers that

215
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,320
understand the nuance and intricacies of

216
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,560
the technical challenges of actually

217
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,040
delivering on the work inside of the

218
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,959
Sprint nobody else can understand that

219
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Nuance because they're living it right

220
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,920
they've got skills that I don't have as

221
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,720
a manager or as a product owner they've

222
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,360
got understanding of the product and the

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
technologies that we're using to deliver

224
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,800
that product the tools and techniques

225
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,639
that we're using their best place to

226
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,200
make that decision now can the product

227
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,959
owner say oh my goodness me we're in a

228
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,360
difficult place because we're not

229
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,880
working through the work that we need to

230
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
deliver as fast as we would like yeah

231
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,519
absolutely they can have that

232
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
conversation and they can have a

233
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,079
conversation with the developers about

234
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:58,760
how the developers might choose to cut

235
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:02,680
Corners into in order to accelerate work

236
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,760
but it must be done with their Ascent if

237
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,600
the developers say no then we can't work

238
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,920
any faster cuz we might be taking on too

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,120
much technical debt and most businesses

240
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,760
and for all businesses all technical

241
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,120
debt is a risk to the business and most

242
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,760
businesses don't understand the context

243
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,800
of technical debt enough to make an

244
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,040
informed decision on whether they should

245
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,519
acrew it and how they should pay it back

246
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,600
that's why we have have hired these

247
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,480
technical experts in order to deliver

248
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,120
our product and we should trust their

249
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,639
understanding and view of the product in

250
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,440
order to do that so I would say that it

251
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:49,560
is a myth that anybody should be telling

252
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,639
the developers what to work on and when

253
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,519
to work on it but I do understand that

254
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,240
lots of organizations don't understand

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,160
how to let go of that control and her

256
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,800
are not yet ready for

257
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:11,120
agile one of the common myths in scrum

258
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,600
is that since we're doing agile we don't

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,320
need no

260
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:21,760
planning um and that is just utter

261
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,839
garbage scrum for example is all about

262
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,880
planning we have Sprint planning we have

263
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,560
refinement which is a type of planning

264
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,040
we have uh daily scrum which is about

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,079
planning the next 24 hours we have a

266
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,800
review where we review what happened

267
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,079
based on the plan and adapt the plan

268
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,399
going forward into the future it's it's

269
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:45,440
all about planning it's all about

270
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,680
getting things right it's not about

271
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,040
planning

272
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:55,160
upfront it's not about

273
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:58,240
spending too much time upfront planning

274
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,320
okay but there's a phrase which is often

275
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,240
misinterpreted

276
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,440
which is we should do just enough

277
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,040
planning we should do just enough right

278
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,720
if we do twoo much planning and we plan

279
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
a bunch of stuff that we end up not

280
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,120
doing because it gets taken out of the

281
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,160
out of the backlog then that was waste

282
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,160
maybe that was okay waste maybe we

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
needed to do that planning in order to

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,880
find out other stuff and have that thing

285
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,839
removed or maybe that was a little bit

286
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,959
too much was is there a way that we

287
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:31,199
could have learned the same thing that

288
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,639
we we learned doing that planning doing

289
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,279
something a little bit

290
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:40,199
less

291
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:42,320
and the converse of that is if you are

292
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,360
building I'm trying to think what you

293
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,160
could be building that needs lots of

294
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,000
let's say you're working on

295
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,680
Windows and you're one of 2 and a half

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,399
thousand software Engineers how many

297
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,240
teams is that metric assloads of teams

298
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,959
right if you you're that many teams

299
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,800
working on one product then you're going

300
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,000
to need to plan right you're going to

301
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,959
need to understand what's happening

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,120
going out into the future you're going

303
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:17,680
to need to coordinate across hundreds of

304
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,680
teams on Direction and strategy I mean

305
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,519
most of that in scrum is done through

306
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,160
communication right Vision product goal

307
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,320
Sprint goal right you've got that

308
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,079
communication chain how do we all get

309
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,639
behind the same thing but

310
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,800
we're trying to

311
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,959
have as

312
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,079
light a plan up front as possible within

313
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,199
our

314
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:49,360
context so even even if I was working on

315
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:52,240
the Windows team I would probably have a

316
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,360
a road map I'm probably going to have a

317
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
road map for my current 6 months if

318
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,600
you're not familiar with how how

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,959
Microsoft product teams

320
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,720
have they've created their own scaling

321
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,560
framework around what they need in their

322
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,160
business um it's often called the

323
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,959
season-based model because they do they

324
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,079
they talk about the spring update and

325
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,040
the fall update for their really big

326
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
products uh many of their products do

327
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,519
continuous delivery but they're talking

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,759
about long-term view of what it is

329
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,880
they're trying to achieve and that's

330
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,839
that's about 6 months and they look

331
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,319
three seasons ahead so they're looking

332
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,480
18 months out they have an 18mon plan

333
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,759
and I'm using air quotes because it's

334
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,399
probably pretty vague right if you're

335
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:43,639
looking at that third season out things

336
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:47,360
are really big right you might have um

337
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,759
uh themes rather than individual things

338
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,600
you're going to deliver you might be

339
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,360
looking at what are the investment

340
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,360
opportunities what's happening in the

341
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,759
market where do we need to to get ahead

342
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,040
of the of the competition going over the

343
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,680
next 18 months and that generates these

344
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,079
big themes buckets of work that many

345
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,040
hundreds of teams might work in um to to

346
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,440
actually you know make progress towards

347
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,839
those big themes but you're looking that

348
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,360
far out you're planning that far out you

349
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,680
know um probably what your goal your

350
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,199
product goal if if they call I don't

351
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,120
think they call it that but whatever

352
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:31,959
their their theme for uh their their

353
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,040
primary theme for us each of the seasons

354
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,959
they probably know what they're going to

355
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,240
be 18 months out for the season that

356
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,279
we're in you know we're probably got

357
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,160
backlog items and actual things we're

358
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,639
going to tactically deliver for the next

359
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:52,560
three four maybe five Sprints

360
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:55,160
maybe and then in the next bucket we

361
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,480
maybe have you know here's some Sprint

362
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,959
goals we might tackle here's some

363
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,240
product goals we might look at

364
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,760
um in that next seasonal bucket and then

365
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,919
the season after

366
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,720
that we we don't have any of those

367
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,880
detail just what's the big theme and you

368
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,160
can you can see how they did that they

369
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,919
did a uh one recently uh I'm saying

370
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,959
recently in The Last 5 Years right uh

371
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,480
recently that was called the creators

372
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,000
update so when they when they were

373
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,439
talking to us the general public about

374
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,799
the products they talked about the

375
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,360
creators update we're going to invest in

376
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,320
opportunities to make our systems and

377
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,720
products and services better for

378
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,559
creators that was an organization wide

379
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,039
uh theme that can es spawn out of the

380
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,760
windows team but think of all the things

381
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:46,440
that impacts not only does that impact

382
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,799
on Windows the operating system right

383
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,880
but what about offices impact most

384
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:55,280
people interact with the operating

385
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,280
system through off office so if you're

386
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,120
to hey fever if you're talking about um

387
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,440
pen support right you've got the the the

388
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,280
actual pen touching the screen on the

389
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,240
surface and the number of levels of

390
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,200
capability that it has in that world

391
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,039
you've got so that's that's hardware

392
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,480
that's the surface hardware and perhaps

393
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,000
third party vendor Hardware

394
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,960
collaborating with then you've got the

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,120
application that you're actually is

396
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,320
interpreting those signals so that could

397
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,679
be Microsoft's applications it could be

398
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,360
office it could be third party software

399
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
and then you've got the underlying

400
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,720
operating system which is providing

401
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,960
support for the I think it used to be

402
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:40,400
256 uh levels of pressure and now it's

403
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,440
uh 1024 at least uh uh levels of

404
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,000
pressure that you can put on the pen in

405
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,200
order to to to get that you know I'm

406
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,559
drawing on the page type of type of feel

407
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:55,080
and that requires collaboration looking

408
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,679
forward into the future what do we need

409
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,400
what are we trying to achieve all of

410
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,000
those strategic things happening we just

411
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,159
probably don't store them in a Gant

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,320
chart one of the myths in uh scrum is

413
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,039
that we have have no

414
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,520
governance um this kind of leads on to

415
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,520
the bigger myth that just because it's

416
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,520
not in the scrum guide um doesn't mean

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,120
you're not supposed to do it um scrum

418
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,039
does absolutely have have governments it

419
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,159
has small amounts of governance baked in

420
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:32,280
right but in general you need governance

421
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,280
to build your product so it's kind of

422
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,320
correct to say scrum doesn't have a lot

423
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,480
of governance right there's a very small

424
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,400
amount of governance built in but if you

425
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,880
want to be successful at Building

426
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,440
Products if you're for example Building

427
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,200
Products within the healthcare space

428
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,200
then you're you're going to have to

429
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,520
worry about your ability to support

430
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,880
Hippa to support the Regulatory

431
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,720
Compliance that comes from the outside

432
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,320
don't that's governance imposed on your

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,919
organization from the outside that you

434
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,960
have no control of um you're going to

435
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,840
have um things that your organization

436
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,799
does internally perhaps uh your

437
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:17,080
organization has usability guidelines

438
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:19,000
perhaps they have um uh uh uh like ux

439
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,080
guidelines for here's how our all our

440
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,640
products ux is going to function so that

441
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,360
anybody interacting with our software

442
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,200
already knows how it's going to work

443
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,120
because it follows the same rules um

444
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,480
then that's internal governance that has

445
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,760
been applied to your product you maybe

446
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,640
have a a business um rules that are

447
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,720
another form of governance you might

448
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,840
have particular ways in which you

449
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,280
interact with the market as a business

450
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,159
that's your unique uh one of your unique

451
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,200
selling points your unique engagement

452
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,200
points with the market and they have

453
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,159
those those ways of working have to be

454
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,600
implemented in your systems in that way

455
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,600
that's internal governance

456
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,600
just

457
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:10,520
because scrum talks about um minimizing

458
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,880
that governance doesn't mean it's not

459
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,080
there right you just you have just

460
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,279
enough governance to support the

461
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,559
business need um it's when you have way

462
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,200
too much governance that you start

463
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:27,039
running into a problem that's why in

464
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,880
very large organizations for example

465
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,880
Banks right they really struggle to move

466
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,960
towards uh scrum and agile practices

467
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,360
because they're encumbered by the

468
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,720
baggage that they can't put down uh

469
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,400
Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK was the

470
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,120
I think it was the first bank in the

471
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,320
world it's currently the fifth biggest

472
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,880
bank in the world um and they've been

473
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,760
going for over 200 years can you

474
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,279
imagine the the the the procedural and

475
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,919
compliance baggage that organization has

476
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,880
many of it around for no other reason

477
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,520
than nobody's Revisited it in a long

478
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,400
time nobody's challenged it in a really

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,840
long time how many policies and

480
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,120
procedures do you have in your

481
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,240
organization that nobody knows where

482
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,760
they came from or what they're for or

483
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,720
who owns that policy or procedure or why

484
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,400
right it's just the way we do things

485
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,039
here those are the things that we want

486
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,640
to challenge we want to challenge

487
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,520
anything that gets in the way of inh

488
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,960
inhibiting our ability to deliver value

489
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,640
those are the things we want to prevent

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,200
those are the uh policies practices and

491
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,590
procedures the governance that we want

492
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:50,720
to reduce to the absolute m

493
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:50,720
