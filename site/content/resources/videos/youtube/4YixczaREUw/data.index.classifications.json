Direct mentions of Scrum and its practices, such as Sprint Planning and Daily Scrum, are frequent throughout the content, indicating a strong focus on the framework itself. The conceptual alignment is high because it emphasizes the roles of planning, governance, and team autonomy within Scrum, which is central to understanding Agile methodologies. The depth of discussion is also substantial, providing insights into how these myths can impact Scrum implementation, thus adding significant value to understanding and applying this framework in various organisational contexts.",

There are no direct mentions, references, or discussions regarding Service Level Expectation (SLE), its calculation, benefits, or role in Agile, Scrum, or Kanban frameworks. None of the primary or secondary topics relates to the definition, application, or improvement of SLE. The main purpose is to inform and guide Scrum practitioners and organizational leaders, which loosely aligns the audience and overall tone with the category, but the content itself does not support, mention, or elaborate on SLE in any substantive way. Thus, the scores for mentions, alignment, depth, and intent are extremely low, while audience alignment and signal scores are higher due to relevance to general Agile/Scrum practitioners. No penalties apply since the content is not outdated, critical, or satirical toward SLE. The final confidence score is very low and proportionate to the total lack of relevance to Service Level Expectation.",
