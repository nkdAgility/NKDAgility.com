1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,800
how does a scrum master or agile coach

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,860
motivate a scrum team

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,740
I don't know is that their job

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,460
I think it's part of their job I mean

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,460
the the the

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,539
[Music]

7
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,359
accountability of the scrum Master is

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,360
the effectiveness of the team how are we

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,399
as effective as possible and sad unhappy

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,520
people doing work are definitely not

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,260
effective if people don't care about the

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,840
work that they're they're doing if they

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,879
don't feel an empathetic connection to

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,160
the product an empathetic connection to

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,860
this to the stakeholders or the

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,480
customers then you're not going to get

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,160
great products that's where great

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,620
products come from

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,140
so if a team is eminently demotivated

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,280
you've got to figure out a way to to to

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,320
get some mojo back into that team

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,720
um so that they can move forward a

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,560
really common thing that I I see is the

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,600
reason why teams get demotivated

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,920
um is we're building the wrong thing and

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,400
nobody turns up at the Sprint review

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,720
right that's one if even the I I had I

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,420
worked with a team in in Norway and the

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,880
product owner didn't even bother to turn

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,140
up for the Sprint review so why would

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,180
the team

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,799
care about what it is they're building

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,780
if even the product owner doesn't care

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,960
about what it is that they're building

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,299
right that's that's that's really

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,740
powerful message there

37
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,939
um but

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,259
quite often it's because of the Sprint

39
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,040
goal

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,220
um because teams tend to create Sprint

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,460
goals that Encompass the entire Sprint

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,500
right so this you need the entire 10

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,780
days and a two-week Sprint 10 days to go

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,340
well in order to achieve the Sprint goal

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,659
or

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,000
um you've got a Sprint goal that's

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,400
complete these 10 things right that's

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,560
also that one or these three features

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,980
that's the other one that I see as well

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,120
right they're they're all [Â __Â ] sprinkles

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,300
because what what happens is the chances

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,120
of success are smaller

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,400
and I don't know about you but if I say

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,900
to my customers I'm going to do this and

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,060
then I have to listen to them complain

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,420
about how I didn't manage to do that for

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,459
whatever reason I'm not a happy team and

58
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,760
if you do that Sprint on Sprint on

59
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,140
Sprint on Sprint why would you think you

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,560
the outcome would be anything else other

61
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,440
than a demotivated unhappy uh team that

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
isn't able to to deliver working product

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,840
so

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,040
figuring out that the Sprint goal

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280
doesn't have to be your whole Sprint

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,099
right and if you've got three important

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,319
things you're working on pick one what's

68
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,940
the most important what's the not even

69
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,099
what's the most important thing for the

70
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,140
product right that for your Sprint goal

71
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,300
what's the most important thing for your

72
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,879
stakeholders at Sprint review right what

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,180
do they care about that's

74
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,260
your sprinkle it might only be 20 of the

75
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,480
work you're going to do in the Sprint

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,000
that's your sprinkle that's what you're

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,420
committing to show them at the end of

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,800
that Sprint everything else then

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,420
effectively becomes optional that's your

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,480
your buffer zone but you're gonna do as

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,680
much as you can of that other stuff that

82
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,599
needs to happen

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,640
right it could be long-term

84
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,739
architectural changes are happening it

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,379
could be two other features that you're

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,860
working on in the product

87
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:50,879
um and and but reduce the size of that

88
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,220
Sprint goal so that you have more chance

89
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,319
of being successful at the end of the

90
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,640
Sprint and if you're successful into the

91
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,560
Sprint it'll add a little bit of

92
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,299
happiness to your team you know we were

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
able to be successful we did something

94
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,959
we provided it if you focused on

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
something that's of value to your

96
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,500
customers then the customers are like oh

97
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,599
great job team right this is awesome

98
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,099
we've this is exactly what we want and

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,400
here's how we want you to just because

100
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,160
they're engaging right so the team sees

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,199
people that care about what the work

102
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,780
that they're doing engaging with them

103
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,600
and that builds that motivation

104
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,800
um so if you really goes back to Dan

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,180
Pink's book drive right autonomy Mastery

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
and purpose

107
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:37,320
right hey that that purpose piece if you

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,740
don't have purpose it all falls apart

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:45,000
um so it makes sure that your your team

110
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:48,060
um understands how their work helps

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,040
other people and have those other people

112
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,660
part of that Sprint review so that they

113
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,280
can tell the team that yeah this is

114
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,960
great it's helping us we've solved this

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,060
problem we've solved that problem here's

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,919
the next thing we need to work on and

117
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,940
you'll start to build that motivation in

118
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,340
the team
