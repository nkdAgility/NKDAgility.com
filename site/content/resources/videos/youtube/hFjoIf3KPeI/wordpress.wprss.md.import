In a traditional #projectmanagement environment, the #projectmanager actively drives the team to ensure that the #project is delivered on time and within budget. #agile focuses a great deal more on inspiration and capability development to ensure that the #agileteam are building the most valuable product, in the most valuable way, at the most valuable time.

So, how does a #scrummaster create that motivation and inspiration within the #scrumteam? How do they ensure that the team are inspired by the #productvision, #productgoal, and #sprintgoal?
