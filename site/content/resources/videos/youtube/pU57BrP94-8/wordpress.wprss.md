There's heaps of value in reading a book about #scrum, and even more value in doing a 2-day #scrumorg #scrumcourse, but you sometimes find that there is so much information to digest and it's hard to apply everything you learn effectively.

Enter the immersive learning experience. A multi-week learning journey where you don't just learn valuable information, but also get to apply it on the job in the form of assignments and tasks. You also get to bring what you have learned back into the classroom and receive coaching that will help you iterate and improve.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the value of the new immersive learning experience and how it will help you in your job.
