1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,820
so the immersive learning experience

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,240
helps coach people on the job because

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,240
it's done over a number of weeks

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,720
um usually I think the the PSM is eight

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,140
weeks the pspo is seven weeks uh the EPS

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,060
is 10 weeks so we have one session a

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,580
week at the beginning of the week like

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,680
four hours and then at the end of that

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,779
session you get an assignment that

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,099
you're able to then do within your

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,380
organization

12
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,360
so because you're doing it within your

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,719
organization you're then going to come

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,420
to the next session the next week with

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,579
uh you know stuff that didn't work out

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,640
so well or maybe it was all awesome

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,460
right but be able to get feedback and

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,840
iterate on some of those ideas

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,700
um so at the beginning of each session

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,940
apart from the first one obviously we

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,920
have a debrief uh for that for that

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,079
exercise which is why the immersive

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,239
classes tend to be a little bit smaller

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,159
right because we've got to go through uh

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,260
uh everybody's everybody's debrief and

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,200
make sure everybody's good and okay but

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,900
you're also going to have maybe up to 12

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,080
other well 11 other people as well as

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,119
myself for the trainer that you are able

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,759
to have a conversation with right and

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,200
see uh what did they try right if

32
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,240
everybody had the same assignment what

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,979
worked in other organizations maybe

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,500
there's more than one of you from your

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,000
organization and you find out that they

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,740
were successful and you were

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,020
unsuccessful and then you can figure out

38
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,659
well so what did you do differently in

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,040
the organization that was was worked out

40
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,680
and what did I do differently that

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,780
didn't and how do we share that

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,060
knowledge and share that experience so

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,939
that's that that iterative double Loop

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,740
learning that you get so that you can

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,840
collaborate not just within your

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,759
organization but without in the

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,259
immersive uh class experience
