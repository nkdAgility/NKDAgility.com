## Immersive Learning: Revolutionising On-the-Job Agile Learning

In my many years in the Agile landscape, I've keenly observed and deeply felt the power of immersive learning.  🚀 

More than just a buzzword, it signifies a paradigm shift, especially among those familiar with Agile's intricacies. 

## Extended Learning Curve 

Courses such as the PSM, spanning eight weeks, the PSPO over seven weeks, and the EPS for ten weeks, have proven to be game changers.  

The big difference and benefit of immersive learning is that it's completed over several weeks.  It is a massive leap forward in breaking away from the constricted feel of courses packed into a few days at a time.  

The great thing about immersive learning is that we're not speeding through content.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  

With immersive learning, we're embarking on a transformative journey, each week presenting a comprehensive four-hour exploration.  ⏳ 

## Real-World application  

After each learning session, participants can dedicate a week to completing an assignment tailored to their organisational contexts.  🌐 

And it's this direct application that truly makes immersive learning stand out because you're doing it within your organisation, which is a valuable point that I stress a lot. 

Immersive learning gives you the space you need in order to prepare and then approach the next learning session armed with practical experiences, including the good, the bad and the challenging tasks.  

This is more than theoretical —it's learning interwoven with tasks and assignments that give you time to learn on the job. 

## **Valuable Feedback**  

A part of the immersive learning sessions that I always look forward to is the debrief.  

At the beginning of each session, apart from the first one, of course, we first get stuck into a debrief.  

This feedback loop, rich with experiences and insights, ensures the learning process is deeply intertwined with precise learning and understanding.  

Immersive learning is a genuine dialogue of growth.  🔁 

## The Power of Collaboration

Another great point I'd like to make about the immersive learning model is that this methodology thrives on shared experiences.  

With a group of participants, there can be no doubt that everyone's journey enriches the collective learning process.  

I'd also like to highlight the benefits of exploring and having valuable conversations centred around a shared collective exploration, which makes the immersive approach so much more interesting and effective.  🤝 

## Immersive Advantage 

Wrapping things up, I'd like to finish off by saying that immersive learning has an iterative double-loop learning advantage that allows you to collaborate not just within your organisation but also in the immersive class experience. 

This is what makes this learning experience truly stand out.  

Immersive learning isn't just another class—it's a meeting point of diverse insights.
