1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,200
one of the ghosts of agile past is

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,840
Dogma we've all run into those

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:15,440
dogmatic uh uh folks that that try and

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,279
pursue an idea irrelevant of the the

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,359
data and the experience of the people

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,400
around them um we need we need to kick

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,720
those folks to the carb um I usually I I

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,320
I I can be not dogmatic is the wrong

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,280
word um almost 100% of the time when I'm

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,280
working with teams I'm pragmatic but I

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,399
can also be pedantic if I'm in a

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,960
training situation whatever it is I'm

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,039
training if I'm teaching you that thing

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm going to be uh H

15
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:54,280
um specific about what things are called

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
and what they mean based on what they're

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,399
called whether that's scrum or

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,640
continuous delivery or C or or whatever

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,720
it is there are specific meanings for

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,759
the nouns that have been defined within

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
the context of the thing that we're

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,479
learning and we need to understand what

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
they are what the impact is and how they

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
engage with each other in the real world

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,920
with

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,520
teams we need to be pragmatic we need to

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,880
understand that people call things

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,280
different things than we're expecting

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560
they have different uh uh um Knowledge

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,799
and Skills they've come from different

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,079
places where they use things in

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,399
different ways and we need to work

33
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,119
within the bounds of what it is we've

34
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:44,320
got so one of those ghosts of agile past

35
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:47,560
is Dogma oh there's been some dogmatic

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,320
things I've seen uh the worst one was

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:55,439
told to me uh by a good friend and my

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,079
boss Steven Borg about a scrum master

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,560
who had just been fired from their job

40
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,680
in Washington State uh because they had

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,200
been adamant that if the team weren't

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,879
standing up during the daily standup

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,879
then they weren't doing scrum and you

44
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,080
have to be standing up in order to do

45
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:20,200
scrum uh but that team had specifically

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,680
decided uh that they wanted to sit down

47
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,360
because they had a disabled team member

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
in a wheelchair and they didn't want to

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,720
be towering over that

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,440
person that is the right thing that is

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,840
the very definition of a scrum team of

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,120
being respectful to each other of

53
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,360
openness respect and courage to do the

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,640
things that they think are valuable and

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,519
one of those was let's all sit down so

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,040
that we can be at the same level and

57
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,840
work together and this

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,360
dogmatic uh scrum Master uh got

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,760
themselves fired for cause and I think

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:03,680
anyone who is

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,840
dogmatic and dogmatic is where

62
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,440
you're see Dogma has this relationship

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,400
to to to to religion it it's really

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,360
about believing something in spite of

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,840
the evidence to the contrary that's what

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,599
I think about Dogma right so that team

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,239
was told that if they're not standing up

68
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,599
they're not agile when in fact they were

69
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,560
demonstrating agility and sitting down

70
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,120
and the other person was just following

71
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,680
and it's not even the letter of the law

72
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,480
cuz there's no stand up and scrum right

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
but the letter of their understanding of

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,720
the law in order to just enforce that

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,360
rather than working with people within

76
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,280
the context and learning more and that's

77
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,599
where uh Dogma differs uh from just

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,360
being pedantic right uh pedant pedan

79
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,599
pedant I can't even say that word but

80
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:59,239
being pedantic is uh uh sometimes

81
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:03,000
valuable within the context of training

82
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,120
uh but being pragmatic is the way most

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,879
scrum Masters and agile coaches uh

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,200
should be don't be dogmatic be pragmatic

85
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,319
and try and get rid of one of those

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,400
ghosts of agile

87
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,479

90
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,160
consultant or trainer who can don't let

this Phantom undermine the effective

of your value delivery and the longer it
