title: 'The Pitfalls of Routine Agile Questions: Avoiding the Ghosts of Agile Past'
short_title: Pitfalls of Routine Agile Questions
description: Explores how routine Agile questions can hinder team progress, stressing the importance of focusing on value delivery, goal alignment, and managing task bottlenecks.
tldr: Focusing daily meetings on routine status questions leads to disengagement and distracts from delivering real value. Instead, teams should use these meetings to track progress toward sprint goals, manage aging tasks before they become bottlenecks, and adapt ceremonies to support value delivery and continuous improvement. Review your Agile practices and shift the focus from individual updates to team outcomes for better results.

In the world of Agile, we often hear about the famous "three questions" used during the daily [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) or retrospective sessions:

- **What did I do yesterday?**

- **What am I doing today?**

- **What's blocking me?**

These questions are a staple in Agile ceremonies, providing a framework for team discussions. But here's the reality: while there's nothing inherently wrong with these questions, when they become the **sole purpose** of your meetings, it leads to dysfunctional behavior. This blog explores how these Agile routines can quickly turn into "ghosts of Agile past" and why **focusing on value** is a better approach.

## **The Ghosts of Agile Past: The Danger of Routine Questions** **👻**

You’ve probably seen it before: a [Scrum team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}) gathers for the [daily Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/daily-scrum" >}}) or a retrospective, and the meeting turns into a checklist of the three questions. Each team member goes into autopilot, simply answering the questions without giving it much thought.

The problem arises when these **three questions become the primary focus** of the meeting. Here’s what often happens:

- Team members mechanically answer the questions without reflection.

- The **[Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}})** (or worse, the project manager) jots down the answers to update a project plan.

- The real purpose of the daily Scrum – to **focus on progress towards the sprint goal** – gets lost.

⚠️ **Warning**: When your Agile ceremonies become rote procedures, your team risks losing sight of the real goal: **delivering value**.

## **Shifting Focus to Value and Outcomes** **🎯**

So, how do we steer away from these ghosts of the past? By shifting the focus to value. Rather than rigidly following the three questions, Scrum teams should emphasize the progress toward delivering value.

Here’s how you can do it:

- **Focus on the sprint goal**: What is the most critical value we need to deliver, and how are we progressing toward that?

- **Skip the unnecessary updates**: If Bob has been working on the same task for three days, there’s no need to hear the same update every day.

- **Collaborate on blockers**: If several people are working on the same task, only one person needs to provide the update. What matters is the progress the team is making **as a group**.

**Key Takeaways** **📝**

- Focus on **value**, not individual updates.

- Reduce redundancy: **one update** per group working on the same item.

- Use daily Scrums to monitor progress toward the **sprint goal**.

## **Enhancing Meeting Efficiency: Ban the Banana Peel** **🍌**

A fun analogy that many Agile practitioners use is the **banana peel visual**. Imagine a Scrum board with sticky notes representing work items. Next to each note is a banana peel. The longer the peel sits, the browner it gets, and the more fruit flies gather around it. The same goes for tasks that stay stuck on your board: the longer they linger, the harder they are to complete.

Here’s why this happens:

- Work items that are **stuck for too long** are more likely to stay stuck.

- Tasks become exponentially harder to finish as they age.

- Without clear guidelines, tasks may sit **until the end of the sprint**, at which point they are either incomplete or deprioritized.

This visual might seem silly, but it highlights a crucial point: if your team doesn’t **actively manage** tasks that have been on the board for too long, those items become bottlenecks.

### **How to Avoid Task Bottlenecks** **🚧**

- Use metrics like **work item aging** to track how long tasks have been on the board.

- Establish **clear rules** for handling old tasks: don’t let them rot!

- Review which tasks haven’t moved during the **daily Scrum** and decide as a team how to tackle them.

## **Overcoming Outdated Agile Practices** **🚀**

Agile practices, like anything else, evolve over time. The three questions served their purpose in the past, but as teams and workflows become more sophisticated, sticking to these routines can hinder your team’s progress.

Here’s how you can **overcome the ghosts of Agile past**:

- **Focus on [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}})**: Make sure your daily Scrums and retrospectives are centered on delivering value, not just answering routine questions.

- **Involve the whole team**: Ensure that the team is collectively working toward a common goal and not just providing individual status updates.

- **Adapt and evolve**: Don’t be afraid to modify your Agile ceremonies if they no longer serve the team’s needs.

## **Conclusion: Exorcise the Ghosts of Agile Past** **👻**

If your Agile practices are haunted by the ghosts of the past, it’s time to **rethink your approach**. The three questions may have been helpful once, but now it’s time to focus on **value delivery** and [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}).

Remember:

- Rote routines can lead to **dysfunctional behavior**.

- Keep the focus on **progress towards goals** and **value**.

- Manage old tasks before they become bottlenecks.

If your team is struggling with outdated practices, don’t let them haunt you. Reach out to a **Scrum trainer** or **Agile coach** who can help exorcise those phantoms. We’d be happy to assist you on your journey towards a more effective Agile process.
