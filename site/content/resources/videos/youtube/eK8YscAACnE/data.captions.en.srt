1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,480
one of the most common forms of agile

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,679
banditry is the use of story points and

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,639
velocity they're often used to beat the

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,679
team around the head with them they're

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,080
used to Ambush the team uh they're used

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,160
to Ambush leadership as well story

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,920
points and velocity are subjective uh

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,560
they are not useful out with the bounds

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,800
of a conversation between team members

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800
so please don't be an agile Bandit don't

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,480
use story points and velocity in instead

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,360
look at cycle time and throughput and

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,360
other objective measures instead
