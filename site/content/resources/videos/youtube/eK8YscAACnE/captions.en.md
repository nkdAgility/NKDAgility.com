One of the most common forms of agile banditry is the use of story points and velocity. They're often used to beat the team around the head with them. They're used to ambush the team. They're used to ambush leadership as well. Story points and velocity are subjective. They are not useful out with the bounds of a conversation between team members. So please don't be an agile bandit. Don't use story points and velocity. Instead, look at cycle time and throughput and other objective measures.
