00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
one of the most influential people

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,920
um for me in agile is Geronimo pascalo

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,200
who is a Spanish PST

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,500

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,560

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,300
thing and he effectively shared all and

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,779
as much of his learnings

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,480
from that experience with me with the

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,040
other psts in the community and really

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,800
became that kind of Beacon of sharing

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,160
and caring and looking forward into the

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,040
future and trying to help fellow psts

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,420
