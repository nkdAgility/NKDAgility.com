When I reflect on my journey in the agile community, one name stands out prominently: Jernimo Palacios. As a Spanish Professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Trainer (PST), Geronimo has been a beacon of inspiration and knowledge for many of us navigating the complexities of agile practices. His influence on my understanding of Scrum and the broader agile landscape cannot be overstated.

### A Pioneer in Agile

Jernimo was the first individual in Spain to embrace the scrum.org framework, and he didn’t just stop there. He took it upon himself to build a thriving business and consulting network, sharing his insights and experiences with others. This spirit of generosity and collaboration is what truly sets him apart.

In my own experience, having a mentor like Jernimo has been invaluable. Here’s why mentorship is crucial in the agile community:

- **Guidance**: A mentor provides direction, helping you navigate the often turbulent waters of agile implementation. Geronimo’s insights have guided me through various challenges, allowing me to make informed decisions.

- **Embracing Change**: Agile is all about adaptability. Jernimo embodies this principle, always looking for ways to improve and innovate. This mindset is something I strive to adopt in my own practice.

- **Fostering Collaboration**: The agile community thrives on collaboration. By sharing our knowledge and experiences, we can elevate the entire field. I encourage everyone to take a page from Geronimo’s book and contribute to this culture of sharing.
