One of the most influential people for me in agile is Geronimo Pascualo, who is a Spanish PST. He built his own business and consulting network in Spain. First person in Spain to do the scrum.org thing, and he effectively shared all and as much of his learnings from that experience with me, with the other PSTs in the community, and really became that kind of beacon of sharing and caring and looking forward into the future and trying to help fellow PSTs get better at doing the stuff that we do.
