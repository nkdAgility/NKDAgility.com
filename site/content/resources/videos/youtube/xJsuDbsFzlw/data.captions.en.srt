1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,840
so the Sprint planning uh Workshop that

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,020
we have is delivered over multiple

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,300
sessions because we want you to be able

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,220
to have a chance to practice what we're

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,140
talking about right it's designed to be

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,160
run with a single organization

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,380
and we're going to start off by having

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,539
having a workshop where we we figure out

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,520
what Sprint planning is and what it

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,860
means to your organization that's kind

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
of the first part so we'll have a lot of

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,040
learnings in that part a lot of

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,219
exercises working through those those

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,559
ideas and hopefully solid outcome of

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,280
what do you want Sprint planning to be

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,800
within your Arc and then we're going to

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,239
to help you through your first few

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,180
Sprint plannings right uh so so somebody

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,879
there to to facilitate that Sprint

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,579
planning help coach you through it

21
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,400
um help get the most out of it

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,159
um and perhaps give a bunch of feedback

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,780
and debrief those those things what

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
happened during that event so that we

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,420
can make it better and over time what we

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,960
would expect to see is that you take

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,939
over all of that at work in running it

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,119
and making it effective and you make it

29
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,520
even more your own uh by adapting it to

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,680
what you what you need and having

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,860
it emerge over time right it's going to

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,780
keep changing keep emerging and as you

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,119

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,000
get from it and how you can leverage it

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,979
to make your business more successful

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,700

37
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:48,240

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,060

actually depends on how you work there's

40
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,040
no point in me coming to you in person

41
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,200

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,640

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:07,020
right uh so pick whatever format makes

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,039
sense for the way you work uh because

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,200
that's where you're going to get the

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,920
most learnings because the the learnings

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,900
that you get if I'm delivering digitally

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,840

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,200
techniques and practices that work well

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,020
digitally and you can also bring those

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,640
tools and techniques uh into that that

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,840
