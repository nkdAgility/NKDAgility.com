Creating great teams is at the heart of what I call "naked agility." It’s a straightforward concept, yet it’s often overlooked in the hustle and bustle of organisational life. If we have unhappy, disengaged people, we can’t expect to produce exceptional work or build outstanding products. As customers and users, we deserve better than mediocre offerings; we deserve products that enhance our experiences and help us achieve our goals.

### The Importance of Happy Teams

When I reflect on my experiences, it becomes clear that the emotional state of a team directly influences the quality of their output. Unhappy teams don’t just create subpar products; they create products that can be downright detrimental. Here’s what I’ve learned about fostering happiness and engagement within teams:

- **Autonomy**: Team members must have the freedom to make decisions. When people feel they have a say in their work, they become more invested in the outcomes. This engagement is crucial for creativity and innovation.

- **Mastery**: It’s essential for individuals to develop their skills and expertise. Mastery isn’t just about being good at what you do; it’s about striving to be the best. Unfortunately, many organisations stifle this growth, which can lead to frustration and disengagement.

- **Purpose**: Understanding the ‘why’ behind our work is vital. If team members don’t know the direction they’re heading or how their contributions fit into the bigger picture, their motivation wanes. When people care about the purpose of their work, they take greater care in the products they create.

### Enabling Engagement

It’s not enough to simply tell people to care about their work. We must create an environment that fosters this engagement. Here are some strategies I’ve found effective:

- **Encourage Decision-Making**: Empower your team to make choices about their work. This autonomy leads to a sense of ownership and responsibility.

- **Invest in Development**: Provide opportunities for team members to enhance their skills. This could be through training, mentorship, or simply encouraging them to pursue their interests.

- **Communicate the Vision**: Regularly share the organisation’s goals and how each team member’s work contributes to those objectives. This [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) helps everyone feel connected to the mission.

### The Outcome: Great Products

When we cultivate an environment where autonomy, mastery, and purpose thrive, we create great teams. These teams, in turn, produce great products. It’s a cycle that feeds itself: happy, engaged people lead to exceptional work, which leads to satisfied customers.

In my journey, I’ve seen the transformative power of naked agility. It’s about stripping away the layers of bureaucracy and creating a culture where people can flourish. When we prioritise the well-being of our teams, we not only enhance their experiences but also elevate the quality of the products we deliver. 

Let’s strive for greatness—not just in our products, but in the teams that create them. After all, we all deserve to work on something meaningful and impactful.
