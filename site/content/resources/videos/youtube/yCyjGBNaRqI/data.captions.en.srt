1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,280
the purpose of naked

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:11,559
agility is to help organizations create

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,559
great teams I it's something that

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:20,160
I've it's plainly obvious when you say

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:22,439
it but if you have unhappy sad people

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
you're not going to get good work out of

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,400
them you're not going to build great

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,239
products and I believe that

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,960
every person

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:39,000
deserves to be using great products we

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:43,079
as customers we as users of products

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,239
don't deserve bad shitty products we

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,000
don't deserve that we deserve great

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,440
products that provide us with a great

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,640
experience and do great things for us to

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,480
help us do the things that we need to do

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
and unhappy sad teams don't create great

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,000
products they create bad terrible

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,720
products

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,479
in order to have happy

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,759
engaged people we need to create those

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,880
ideas of great teams within our

23
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,119
organization how do we engage with

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,439
people how do we enable them to be the

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,840
productive story that we're trying to

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,799
create and in the creative world in the

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,320
software world that that means autonomy

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,320
Mastery and purpose right autonomy is we

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,320
need to be the ones making the decisions

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,600
we need to be the ones that are on board

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,799
that are engaged in the story The people

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,720
doing the work need to be engaged in the

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,719
story we certainly need to be also be

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,680
masters of the work that we're doing we

35
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,719
need Mastery we need expertise we need

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,880
skills we need knowledge we need to be

37
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,280
able to be uh uh the best that we can be

38
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,640
at at at what it is that we're doing and

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,039
lots of organizations suppress that we

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,200
need purpose we need to understand

41
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,200
understand what direction we're going

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,399
and why we're going there and how the

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,000
work that we're doing contributes to

44
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,560
that story otherwise it doesn't matter

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,680
what we're working on like why would I

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,040
care about the product if I don't know

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,959
what it's for or who it's helping and if

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,440
I don't

49
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,120
care what care am I taking in the

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,480
product in the work that I'm doing I'm

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,360
taking less care because I don't care

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,599
and enabling you can't just tell people

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,319
to care right you have to enable you

54
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,440
have to create an environment within

55
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,959
which the people that are participating

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,239
that are working on the software

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,120
products that you want to create and use

58
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,080
and

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,440
develop care about what they're doing

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,000
they have that autonomy they have

61
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Mastery and they have purpose and that's

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,920
how we create great teams that create

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
great products
