    "reasoning": "The content focuses exclusively on the value of openness and transparency in Scrum, exploring trust, clear communication, accessibility of information, and emotional openness. Nowhere does it mention, allude to, or apply the term 'Service Level Expectation (SLE)' as defined in the context of Agile, Scrum, or Kanban. There's no discussion of forecasting, elapsed time ranges, probabilities, use of historical data, or any quantitative analysis related to SLE. The audience is Scrum practitioners, which partially overlaps with the SLE category, but the discussion is thematically and informationally distant from SLE. While transparency is discussed, this refers to interpersonal and process transparency, not SLE metrics. The scores are all very low to reflect the near-total lack of direct or indirect connection, with minor points for audience overlap and general relevance to process improvement in Scrum. The confidence score is proportionally very low as there is no substantive evidence linking this content to Service Level Expectation as a concept.",
