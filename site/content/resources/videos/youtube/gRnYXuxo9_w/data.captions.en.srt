1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
so the question is what does what does

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,960
openness mean in the scrum values and

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,639
why does it

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,560
matter and I think openness is really

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,840
important it has a number of of of

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,199
aspects to it but it really comes it it

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,800
comes down to that serving of the the

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,359
the transparency right the values are

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
trying to in order to have transparency

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,760
we need Trust

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,879
right without trust we've gotten nothing

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,879
so how do we get trust because trust is

13
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,960
an output not an input right to the to

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,480
the to the story it's just it's a result

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,640
it's a thing that we can observe and see

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,600
that we have but you can't magically get

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,160
it just cuz you want it so openness

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,320
openness serves that by um being be

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,480
being being open well I guess partly

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,359
open and transparent in and of yourself

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,600
right but just telling people people how

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,760
it is right there there are things that

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,479
we need to talk about there's things

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,119
that need to be in place there's um

25
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,840
stories that we need to tell inside of

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
the organization so that everybody

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,479
clearly understands what's going on so

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,880
are we expressing things are we are we

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,640
hiding things right that might be the

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,759
opposite of openness are we are we is is

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,880
it easy for everybody to to find and

32
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,479
understand what's in the product backlog

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,640
is it easy for people to find and

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,960
understand what our working practices

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,119
are is it easy for people to find and

36
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,920
understand how how we as a team do

37
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,720
things or we as a group do things if not

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,159
then how are we being open right um and

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,320
also just just if you bring that back to

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,360
the emotional context right are are are

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,520
we being open and saying to people when

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,320
we don't don't like something are we

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
being open and saying to people when

44
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,479
something's affecting us in a way that

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,360
maybe they didn't know or

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,560
recognize that openness

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,920
enables us all to have a conversation

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,679
because we're talking right we're not

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,120
we're not hiding or resenting uh

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,760
something that's happening in the

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,360
organization we can actually have a

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,040
conversation we can talk about it

53
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,440
whether it's a physical thing that's to

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,080
do with do with scrum or the way we work

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,599
or it's an emotional thing to do with

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,400
the way we interact or communicate with

57
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:29,920
people and just being um being being

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,959
open right that's that's part of that

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,840

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
