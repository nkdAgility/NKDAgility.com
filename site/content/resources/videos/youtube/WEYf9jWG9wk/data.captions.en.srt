1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,560
they went from from 25 features to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,359
production each year with the same

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,760
number of people to nearly nearly 150

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,679
features to production each year and

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,599
even taking four years to get there holy

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,119
moly I would rather have 800 features

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,199
than 25 features right and yes the

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,640
features are smaller but it's more

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,760
experiments right it's more chances to

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,279
get something right it's more ideas to

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,800
see if they connect with the customer so

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,800
in the old way is you you you have to

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,640
stick with and focus on something even

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,960
when it's not quite the most optimal

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,160
thing but if you're doing lots of little

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,399
experiments you can find oh this thing

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
resonates really much more than these

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,760
other things with the customer let's do

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
more on that until it stops resonating

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,760
and then we move on to something else

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,320
and move on to something else and we

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,320
build a better product with more

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
capabilities
