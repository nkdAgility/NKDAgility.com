They went from 25 features to production each year with the same number of people to nearly 150 features to production each year, and even taking four years to get there. Holy moly! I would rather have 800 features than 25 features, right? And yes, the features are smaller, but it's more experiments, right? It's more chances to get something right. It's more ideas to see if they connect with the customer.

So in the old way, you have to stick with and focus on something even when it's not quite the most optimal thing. But if you're doing lots of little experiments, you can find, "Oh, this thing resonates really much more than these other things with the customer." Let's do more on that until it stops resonating, and then we move on to something else and move on to something else. And we build a better product with more capabilities.
