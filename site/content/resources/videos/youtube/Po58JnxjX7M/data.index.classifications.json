There is no mention of OKRs, Objective Key Results, or related outcome-based frameworks. The article does not discuss goal alignment, measurable key results, or any elements foundational to OKR principles or practices. Its intent, depth, and audience do not match the OKR category. Any overlap (continuous improvement, iteration) is incidental and not structured around OKRs or their purposes. Therefore, the confidence is extremely low for inclusion in this category.",

    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses the importance of practical experience for Agile coaches, emphasizing credibility, empathy, and firsthand knowledge. While it highlights aspects of developer agency and team empowerment—somewhat related to Agentic Engineering's focus on human agency—it lacks explicit discussion of decentralised decision-making, AI collaboration, systemic observability, or engineering practices that maximize both human and AI agency. The DevOps mention is peripheral and not linked to agentic practices. No mention of ethical AI, observability, or systematic feedback loops is present. While some conceptual overlap (developer/team autonomy) exists, the core theme is advice for aspiring Agile coaches, not the deliberate design of agentic engineering systems or practices.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article emphasizes the value of practical experience for Agile coaches but does not address the core principles of Agentic Engineering, such as maximizing agency, systemic observability, or AI integration. Its relevance to the category is tangential and limited at best.",

No direct or indirect references to agentic principles, AI agents in delivery processes, or the technical enablers listed in the category definition are present. The content's intent, themes, and audience are squarely aligned with human-centered Agile coaching rather than practices integrating AI or agentic systems. Because the fit is extremely weak (nearly nonexistent), all dimension scores are just above zero only because superficial overlap may exist: both topics relate to improving modern software delivery outcomes, but by entirely different means (human experience vs. agentic augmentation). No outdated practices or anti-category tone are evident, so no penalties applied.",
