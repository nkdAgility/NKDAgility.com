Before you can call yourself an Agile coach, you must, absolutely must, have worked with a team actually building some kind of product. If you're going to be working with teams and helping encourage them to do more practices, more higher quality in their product, you really need to understand and gain credibility from their perspective of actually doing the work. 

So, if you want to be an Agile coach, have you ever worked with a team? If you haven't, go join one, help them build a product, and learn what it takes to work on a team.
