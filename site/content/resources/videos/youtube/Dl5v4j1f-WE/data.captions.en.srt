1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,660
how would you like to be remembered as a

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,860
professional scrum trainer what free

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:20,600
things matter most to you

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,600
uh uh I guess the first one is integrity

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,320
I like to do the right thing I like to

6
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,359
be seen to be doing the right thing

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,460
I don't like to be seen to be doing the

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,079
wrong thing

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,300
I don't like to do the wrong thing not

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,300
just be seen to do it right

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,360
and but some of sometimes that comes

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,260
with hard choices because

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,379
it might be easier for me

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,920
to market for example Market my classes

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,140
in a particular way that I don't believe

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,559
is

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,480
morally effective probably is the the

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,000
like it's not moral

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,100
for me to do that

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,159
um I could I could have I could have a

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,700
policy whereby if a customer came to me

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,159
and had a quote from another another

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:16,740
scrum trainer that maybe I know right

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,500
that I could undercut their their price

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,740
in order to win the the business

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,020
but I don't do that I I have all of my

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,700
rates published on my website I do give

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,799
people discounts right but I have all of

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
my rates published on my website and

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,280
that's generally the rates that that I

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,119
quote

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,840
um

33
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,700
so people know even my competitors know

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
how much I'm going to be going to be

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,060
charging and they're welcome to undercut

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,119
me right but I'm not going to do that to

37
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,920
them because I think that's morally

38
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,060
repugnant within the bounds of

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,500
where a bunch of people trying to do the

40
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,320
right thing it's not in keeping with the

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,979
with the scrum values right so

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,100
um yeah that's the first thing

43
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,100
um

44
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,020
forthright probably

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,840
forthrightness that part of that comes

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:21,020
from uh my my ESD neural Divergent right

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:24,720
is that I don't like things to be wrong

48
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,459
and for me I'm I I feel like I'm

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,739
reasonably good at separating out the

50
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,780
difference between

51
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,340
the data

52
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,220
I.E what's what's the truth of the

53
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,900
matter versus what my opinions are on

54
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,560
top of that

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,379
um so I I I'll work with organizations

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,620
and I'll help them understand

57
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:50,040
not only what's broken

58
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,080
uh but what my suggestion is for for how

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,580
to fix it right and my suggestion part

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,099
might be right or might be wrong for

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,099
them they need to try it and see

62
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,940
but the data is the truth

63
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,580
um

64
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,560
and that's really important to me

65
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,660
um just in general so that's that would

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,819
be that would be the second thing

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,840
I'd like I'd like

68
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,940
um

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
I'd like people to think of think of me

70
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,860
as somebody that they they they can they

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,860
can come with their problems and I'm not

72
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,379
gonna sugarcoat anything but I'm also

73
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,400
not gonna poop on them does that make

74
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:28,080
sense like I I if they're doing if they

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,860
or their organization is doing something

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,959
that is downright Daft for example stack

77
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,819
ranking all of their employees right

78
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,620
that's I've seen that Microsoft did that

79
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,420
many minutes ago

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,060
um

81
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,340
the detrimental effects to a business

82
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,980
its organization the ability for people

83
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,159
to function is is is fairly well

84
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,400
documented for those types of issues

85
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,220
so I can categorically say that's a bad

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,319
idea here is the effect it's going to

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,440
have in your organization

88
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,120
um I'm not going to say that something's

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,220
I'm not going to say that something's

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,260
good if it's not

91
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,019
but that comes back to that that second

92
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,580
one right of of of honesty and what what

93
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,200
are the what are the facts if you're

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,380
doing something stupid you're doing

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
something stupid nothing I sugarcoat is

96
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,859
going to make it unstippit so what's the

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,280
point in the sugar coating when all that

98
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,320
does is bring politics into the story

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,900
whereas you can do something with that

100
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,400
data of okay I understand this is a bad

101
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,320
thing and I can do something with it so

102
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,940
I feel like that that ability for people

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,860
to come to me

104
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,780
um and that's why I offer

105
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,780
you know 60 Minutes one-on-one

106
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,160
Consulting and ultimately I have I have

107
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,440
people that I work with that keep coming

108
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,960
back for that for that 16 60 minutes

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,880
because not everybody uses it so it's

110
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
it's it's fine until it's a problem it's

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,040
fine right it's like Air Miles

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,600
um the the the they keep coming back and

113
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,340
they'll ask me questions they'll they'll

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,720
describe a problem or situation in their

115
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,280
organization and I'll give them advice

116
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,460
I'll give them free Consulting right

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,900
because because they need help they came

118
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,759
on my training course I built a

119
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,440
relationship with them

120
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,300
um I want to continue that relationship

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,040
and I want to continue to help them and

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm not going to charge them for that

123
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,620
because that's just me helping somebody

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,400
out I think that kind of comes from my

125
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,160
time as a Microsoft MVP right the the in

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,900
order to be in a Microsoft MVP you're

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,759
not getting paid to do the thing that

128
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,979
you do

129
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,479
right the thing you get your MVP for is

130
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,340
not stuff you get paid for it's

131
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,960
basically for giving free advice and

132
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,759
Consulting to anybody who needs it

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,400
whether that be in the form of blog

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,280
posts or conference talks or just

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,440
talking to people or presenting uh the

136
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,600
product and where things are are buried

137
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,479
it's it's where the bodies are buried

138
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,180
right it's it's it's that free and open

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,800
transfer of information that is really

140
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,840
important to me if you want to come and

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,120
do a scrum.org class then you know

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,199
there's a cost for doing a scrum.org

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,400
class

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
um but if you just want to come and have

145
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,600
a chat with me for 30 minutes

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,699
go to my website it's free book up book

147
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
a 30 minute chat have a chat talk about

148
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,240
anything you like we could talk about

149
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,100
board games if you like I don't mind

150
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,720
what it is

151
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,460
um because I'm always happy to hear from

152
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,259
people and chat to them and I think

153
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,660
especially in this

154
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,759
in this day and age there's there's too

155
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,080
few there's nowhere for people to go for

156
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,819
help

157
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,940
right you can you if you've got good

158
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,979
Google Foo right or bingfu you can go

159
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,100
find uh

160
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,100
um

161
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,240
contexts

162
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,039
on the internet where other things have

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,039
helped other people but they're never

164
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,139
the same as your context and while I'm

165
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,300
very good at finding code contacts that

166
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,100
help me like when I'm coding I'll be

167
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,720
able to go find some code and then adapt

168
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,819
it to what I need

169
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,100
I think that's much harder when we're

170
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,840
talking about people and relationships

171
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,479
and practices and how we work in

172
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,699
organizations and sometimes you want an

173
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,039
expert to hear the story and then offer

174
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:07,560
some advice and I have a number of

175
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,240
people that have literally I met them

176
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,840
coming through my classes whether public

177
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,759
or private that keep coming back and we

178
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,740
chat all the time I've got what one

179
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,240
scrum master in fact he wasn't a scrum

180
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,560
Master when I met him

181
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,500
um he is now and uh we have

182
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,759
multiple chats a week just talking about

183
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,280
things that are going on in the

184
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,620
organization how could maybe he could

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,599
maybe do things differently he he talks

186
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,979
about his wins right somebody to talk to

187
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,020
about the things that you've been able

188
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,580
to achieve and what's the next thing I

189
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,860
should be thinking of and was that a

190
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,720
good idea right and I think that's

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,960
that's something we all need

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,720
so so if there was one thing like the

193
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,259
top thing it would be

194
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,300
um I'd like to be known as somebody who

195
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,740
is approachable even though I'm

196
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,840
sometimes very pedantic right but

197
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,960
approachable and able to separate out

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,940
that pedantic nature of

199
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,919
following the scrum guide right that's

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,199
that pedantic part of learning something

201
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,819
I.E the teacher mode right you're

202
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
learning something you want a teacher to

203
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,000
be pedantic because that's how that

204
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,060
works

205
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
and the pragmatic side which is well I'm

206
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,720
trying to do this in my company and this

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,220
is my situation which means I can't do

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
this thing that you said would be a good

209
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,180
idea how else could I work at this and

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,620
I'm not going to say well that sucks you

211
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,660
have to do it this way I'm like well

212
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,379
let's figure out within the bones of

213
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,899
your organizational context what is some

214
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,979
way that you can try and make things a

215
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,320
little bit better a little bit more

216
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,500
effective that that's probably the main

217
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,500
thing

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,740
