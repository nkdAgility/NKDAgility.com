It's about being seen to do the right thing. üíØ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Sometimes, as a professional Scrum Trainer, you're faced with decisions where it's tempting to make easy choices, like marketing my classes in a particular way that might not resonate with my core beliefs or undercutting a competitor's prices to snag a client. &nbsp;&nbsp;üèÖ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But that's not me. &nbsp;I prefer transparency and fairness, such as publishing all my rates on my website, for instance.&nbsp; I know this means that my competitors know what I charge, and they're welcome to undercut me, but it also means that my clients know I'm honest and upfront from the very beginning.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, I won't do the same as some of my competitors because, to me, that's morally unacceptable and goes against the Scrum values. &nbsp;It's just not me.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-honesty-and-forthrightness\">Honesty and Forthrightness</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The second thing that's incredibly important to me is forthrightness. &nbsp;Being straightforward is key. &nbsp;I'm all about zeroing in on the truth and separating it from opinions. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When working with organisations, I focus on helping them understand not only what's broken but also providing suggestions on how to fix it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I also strive to differentiate between the facts and my own opinions.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I know these suggestions may or may not work for them. &nbsp;What matters is the data and the facts - the unvarnished truth, which I hold in high regard.&nbsp; It's of paramount importance to me.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-being-approachable-and-helpful\">Being Approachable and Helpful</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The final point in my trifecta is my openness and willingness to lend a helping hand. &nbsp;I want people to remember me for my approachability and willingness to assist.&nbsp; People can approach me with their problems, and they know I won't sugarcoat things. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, I also won't be unnecessarily harsh either. &nbsp;Instead, I offer straightforward advice backed by data and facts.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the services I'm most proud of is offering free 60-minute one-on-one consulting because people need help. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Many individuals I've worked with appreciate this service and keep coming back. &nbsp;I consider these relationships valuable, and I want to continue to help them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This approach of mine stems from my time as a Microsoft MVP, where the aim was to provide free advice and consultation to whoever needed it. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Whether it's a quick chat or a deep dive into a complex issue, I'm here to help. &nbsp;It's about the free and open transfer of information, something I truly value.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At the end of the day, I'd love to be known as someone approachable. Despite being pedantic, I‚Äôm also pragmatic. &nbsp;But there‚Äôs a reason for my pedantic nature, which is the unchangeable fact that the learning process, according to Scrum principles, needs to be precise.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>I'm always ready to help figure out ways to make things more effective within your organisation's unique circumstances.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Interested in learning more about Scrum?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Join me in my Agile and Scrum courses, where we deep-dive into these values and more.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Can't wait to see you there! üöÄ</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
