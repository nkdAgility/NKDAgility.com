## My Professional Scrum Trainer Legacy: What Matters Most to Me?

Hello to all my Agile and Scrum enthusiasts!

I get asked a lot of questions, and I think the question of how I'd like to be remembered as a professional Scrum Trainer is definitely one I have thought about in the past and I would like to share my top three priorities that are important to me.

So, without further ado, let's dive into the three things that matter most to me as a Professional Scrum Trainer!

## Integrity

Let's kick off with my numero uno - Integrity.  Integrity is right at the top of my list.  For me, it's not just about doing the right thing. It's about being seen to do the right thing. 💯

Sometimes, as a professional Scrum Trainer, you're faced with decisions where it's tempting to make easy choices, like marketing my classes in a particular way that might not resonate with my core beliefs or undercutting a competitor's prices to snag a client.   🏅

But that's not me.  I prefer transparency and fairness, such as publishing all my rates on my website, for instance.  I know this means that my competitors know what I charge, and they're welcome to undercut me, but it also means that my clients know I'm honest and upfront from the very beginning.

However, I won't do the same as some of my competitors because, to me, that's morally unacceptable and goes against the Scrum values.  It's just not me.

## Honesty and Forthrightness

The second thing that's incredibly important to me is forthrightness.  Being straightforward is key.  I'm all about zeroing in on the truth and separating it from opinions.  

When working with organisations, I focus on helping them understand not only what's broken but also providing suggestions on how to fix it.   I also strive to differentiate between the facts and my own opinions.

I know these suggestions may or may not work for them.  What matters is the data and the facts - the unvarnished truth, which I hold in high regard.  It's of paramount importance to me.

## Being Approachable and Helpful

The final point in my trifecta is my openness and willingness to lend a helping hand.  I want people to remember me for my approachability and willingness to assist.  People can approach me with their problems, and they know I won't sugarcoat things.  

However, I also won't be unnecessarily harsh either.  Instead, I offer straightforward advice backed by data and facts.

One of the services I'm most proud of is offering free 60-minute one-on-one consulting because people need help.  

Many individuals I've worked with appreciate this service and keep coming back.  I consider these relationships valuable, and I want to continue to help them.

This approach of mine stems from my time as a Microsoft MVP, where the aim was to provide free advice and consultation to whoever needed it.  

Whether it's a quick chat or a deep dive into a complex issue, I'm here to help.  It's about the free and open transfer of information, something I truly value.

At the end of the day, I'd love to be known as someone approachable. Despite being pedantic, I’m also pragmatic.  But there’s a reason for my pedantic nature, which is the unchangeable fact that the learning process, according to Scrum principles, needs to be precise.

I'm always ready to help figure out ways to make things more effective within your organisation's unique circumstances.
