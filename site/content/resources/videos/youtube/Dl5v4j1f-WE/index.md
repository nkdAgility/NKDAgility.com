# How would you like to be remembered as a Professional Scrum Trainer?

#scrumorg was created by the cocreator of #scrum, Ken Schwaber, with the intention of providing aspiring #scrummasters, #productowners, and #scrumdevelopers with a rock-solid training and certification experience.

Something that really prepared them for the working #scrum environment and empowered them to contribute value from their first day on the job, with the intention of learning and evolving from there.

#professionalscrumtrainers or #PST are the people identified by Ken Schwaber as the perfect training facilitators, scrum coaches, and scrum trainers to help you on that journey.

So, the bar has been set really high as a #PST, but what else really matters? How would Martin HInshelwood want to be remembered in the context of a professional #scrumtrainer?
