The target audience is general Agile practitioners interested in Sprint Review ceremonies, not those seeking guidance on SLE within Agile/Kanban frameworks. The only minor alignment is a generic reference to feedback, improvement, and retrospectives, but this is far removed from SLE's specific purpose. Signal-to-noise ratio remains low for the SLE category. No penalties were warranted.",
