This workshop was delivered on 27th September 2021 and focused on introducing the core concepts of the Agile Leader and evidence-based management. I used a combination of Liberating Structures, Microsoft Teams, and Mural to deliver an interactive session. This session went really well however we had some technical issues on the live stream!

## Introduction to Agile Leadership \[Review\]

**Product Vision \\ Goal:** Demonstrate the viability and drive interest of live virtual delivery of content as a primary and premier method to share ideas and content.

### Iteration Summery

For this fifth session, my goal was to validate the technology in use and become more proficient.

The session went well and we covered everything that I wanted to.

### Delivery

I believe that we met the goal and the feedback was very positive ( Other than those that could not get in). I was very happy with all of the technology used.

### Feedback

There was time for feedback and I appreciate it all.

There was a lot of feedback around the meeting link but I am unsure what I can do. Mighty Networks provides the link on the Event in two places and while for me this is obvious what is not obvious is that it hides the link unless you say "Going". I will try turning that off for future.

## Introduction to Sprint Reviews \[Retrospective\]

The additional changes on the live stream worked well, soundcheck was a success.

**Retrospective outcome:** more of the same... build on quality.

## Other Workshops: Whats Next?
