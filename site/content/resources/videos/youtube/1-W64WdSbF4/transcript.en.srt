1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,059
[Music]

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:24,080
[Music]

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,279
do that

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,359
okay

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,279
um i guess uh welcome to this is the

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,360
is this the fifth

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,399
fourth fifth

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,760
fifth

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,960
uh um live workshop that i've been

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,040
doing uh this one is introduction

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
to the sprint review

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,039
so we're going to dive a little bit into

13
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,320
how the sprint review works

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
and maybe

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
why it's not working for us because in

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,320
some cases i'm sure it's it's it's not

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
working

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
um and how to do it a little bit better

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,160
um hopefully

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,399
this will be a good interactive

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
experience and i'm going to try my best

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
um to do better with the timing because

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,560
last week's uh not last week's two weeks

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,040
ago the

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,600
um kanban session

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
um that was the main feedback was

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,479
martin's timings up

28
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
so

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,439
um i'm gonna gonna try and do better at

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,920
that

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
peter is a veteran of some of my my my

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,799
sessions so he knows that my timing

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,400
quite often sucks so um

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
that's just the way it is sometimes

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
when when you

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,119
the participants have lots of awesome

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,640
information to impart sometimes it's

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,320
more interesting to listen to what

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
people have to say

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
uh so we have eight people

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,240
in person just now um i'm sure a few

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,360
people will turn up um as we go

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,880
um but i have as usual a little

44
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,159
icebreaker for us with some questions

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
about

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,240
the

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
um

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
let me just unlock them for you

49
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
unlock

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
um with some questions

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
about

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,080
the

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,920
sprint review

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,400
and i'd like you to

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,440
drag have a read of the the different

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,040
questions

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,640
um and drag either a tick or a cross

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
uh onto

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,599
um

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,800
on to the hexagon on whether you agree

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,800
with that statement or not

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
i did these ones a while ago so i i

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,120
don't actually remember how many trues

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,319
and how many falsies i've got so we'll

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
need to

66
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
we'll need to take a look

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
oh

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,200
has anybody got things dropping behind

69
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
nope awesome

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,319
just making sure because that's

71
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,440
sometimes a a mural

72
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,440
mural problem a tool problem

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,519
uh one perfect assistant for you

74
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,440
[Music]

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
i'll put another four minutes on the

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,319
timer for us to to go through this and

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,800
then at the end of

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,760
um this exercise i'm going to lock the

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,150
meeting

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
um

81
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,959
[Music]

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
we had

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
lots of disruption in the first session

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
with people kind of hopping in and out

85
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,799
of the meeting during the session so

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,799
um we lock it it does mean if you do

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720
drop out accidentally

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,120
um because of internet or whatever

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
you'll not be able to get back in and i

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,760
apologize for that

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,000
um if you were uh

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
if you're still waiting to participate

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
you can

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,200
click the links and get into the

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,200
meeting before it closes

96
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,360
it interferes with my ability to quit

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,519
breakout rooms when people are joining

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
and leaving and joining and leaving

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,720
and then of ends up in a breakout room

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
on his own when it's supposed to be a

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,400
pair and he's like what the heck's going

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
on

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,199
yeah

104
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,199
i normally end up alone somewhere

105
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
it's a time when i actually can do some

106
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
work that's

107
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,479
even

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
where's f

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,479
okay well let's not use that button how

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,479
do you do

111
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,120
i've got a new keyboard

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,840
function lock that's what i want

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
f11 there we

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,240
go um

115
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,919
okay

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
we have well there's some that are not

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
ambiguous at all

118
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
number five

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,960
this is the only event where

120
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,479
stakeholders are regularly invited to

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
participate

122
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
everybody's on the same page for that

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,680
one for sure

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,880
let me grab a big tick i agree with

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
everybody

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
on that one

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
uh during the sprint review the product

128
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,759
owner may share budgetary

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,680
and likely release dates

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
i'm going to put another big tick oh

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,639
i'll grab the big take because then it's

132
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
already the right size there we go i'm

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,800
going to put another big take on that

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,080
one

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
we we

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,360
we want to we'd like to use the sprint

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
review as one of the primary

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
communication

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
mechanisms where we've got everybody

140
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,440
together

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,080
right so it's open it's transparent the

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,720
stakeholders are there the team is there

143
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
and perhaps leadership is there and the

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
product owner's there and we can

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
communicate things in an open and

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
transparent manner

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,160
and it allows us to maybe

148
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,160
have or not have or deal with

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
some of those things that come up when

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
somebody else thinks their stuff is more

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,120
important than everybody else's stuff

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
maybe they can openly and transparently

153
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,560
say so and why

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
and then find out they're wrong because

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,160
everybody else has other ideas right

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,919
that's kind of kind of the value in that

157
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
uh in this event

158
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,360
stakeholders and scra the scrum team

159
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,600
collaborate on next things

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,720
that could be done to optimize value

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
that's another green hick there

162
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,840
and we want to

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,600
what's next

164
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,840
right something might have changed so we

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,759
need to figure that

166
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,280
out uh then we get number three i'm not

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
doing them in any particular order i

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
guess new microlighter might have made

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,400
more sense but that's not the way i

170
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
started number three during the sprint

171
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,639
review the product owner may present a

172
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,160
forecast of progress towards the product

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
goals

174
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
right

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,720
um product goals are

176
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
pretty important

177
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
in scrum they help us focus the product

178
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
backlog

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
and gives gives us

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,919
ah what's the best way to describe a

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
product goal

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,319
so

183
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
we're going to have some kind of vision

184
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
or strategic goal for our product

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,720
and then

186
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,599
that might be

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
too nebulous too far out

188
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
for the people doing the work to

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
actually connect

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,319
to that idea

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,400
so a product goal is an intermediary

192
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,520
strategic goal

193
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
that is

194
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
far enough out that it's a bunch of

195
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,319
sprints but close enough that we as

196
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,000
people doing the work can actually see

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,039
how the work we're doing contributes

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
towards

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,240
that thing because sometimes the vision

200
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,720
is you know some solve some esoteric

201
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
customer problem and it's difficult to

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,360
see how we get there because that's two

203
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,080
years away um so how do we get something

204
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
a little bit closer to connect to

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,759
uh number one

206
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,479
the purpose of the sprint review is to

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,720
assess if the product increment should

208
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,120
be released to market

209
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
i would say yes it is

210
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,400
if your stakeholders are sitting there

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,800
saying we can get value from what is

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,319
what you have done so far

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
why would you leave it sitting on a

214
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
shelf

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
why wouldn't you ship it to customers

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,520
now you might not ship it to customers

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,639
if the cost to ship to customers is too

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
high

219
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,879
right

220
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,039
but then i would want to have a

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,440
conversation about why is the cost to

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,000
ship to customers so high

223
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,000
how can we fix that problem

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
shouldn't each increment go to the

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
you

226
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,039
it it should be released but regardless

227
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,039
it shouldn't be

228
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,320
it shouldn't be part of the

229
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,279
review to assess if it can be shipped

230
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,880
ah so i think it's saying if it should

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,880
be shipped

232
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,800
so if we have a potentially releasable

233
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,320
increment at the end of the sprint we

234
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
get together at the sprint review and

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
one of the outcomes might be push the

236
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,640
red button to actually release it it

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,839
actually goes to production

238
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:11,040
um scrum the scrum guide doesn't

239
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,040
require or enforce in any way that you

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
do ship to production at the end of

241
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,240
every sprint

242
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,360
and it just requires that you have a

243
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
potentially shippable increment a usable

244
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
increment

245
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,880
um

246
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,720
i would add to the scrum guide and say

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
yes you should beat shipping to

248
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,399
production at the end of every sprint

249
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
and if you can't ship to production i'd

250
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,440
want to figure out why and how do we fix

251
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
those things

252
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
that statement just had two negatives

253
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
and didn't catch both of them the assess

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,399
and should because i thought assess

255
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,880
if yeah i missed the should instead of

256
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
yep that's probably my bad english of i

257
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,040
know of norwegian so he obviously has

258
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,600
better english than the rest of us for

259
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,519
sure no i'm just the two negatives

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
caught me okay yeah

261
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,120
that that's my experience of being in

262
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,839
norway as i say stuff and people are

263
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,839
like yeah that's wrong

264
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
we don't speak english in scotland do we

265
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,760
peter

266
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,519
no no no i just uh yeah i'm just saying

267
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
the two negatives in that statement

268
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,000
caught me off guard yeah what did i just

269
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,959
i missed this should the ss and should

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,920
release to production okay

271
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,160
uh

272
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
what we got left number two

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,040
by the way that's the reason why i'm the

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
red dot

275
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,959
okay that's okay you did not you were

276
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
not required to own up to that

277
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,560
um station two this is a four hour time

278
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,279
box event for a one month sprint

279
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,160
that that is what the scrum guide says

280
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,560
up you have up to four hours

281
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,120
for a sprint review

282
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
right and it's usually

283
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,360
it's proportionally less for shorter

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,519
sprints so if you're doing a two-week

285
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,160
sprint you kind of have up to two hours

286
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,399
i would suggest

287
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,680
that if you're not having enough

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,600
conversations to fill that time

289
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,040
that for me would indicate

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
a smell

291
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,279
i'm not going to say it's wrong

292
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
right if you do a 15 minute sprint

293
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
review and everything is awesome you're

294
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
building the right thing your

295
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
stakeholders are happy they understand

296
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
what's going on your team knows where

297
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,959
you're going um and you can do that in

298
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
15 minutes

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,440
oh awesome

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,519
right

301
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,440
but in general i would see it as a smell

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
if you're not able to fill that time or

303
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,920
at least fill a good proportion of that

304
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,079
time it would mean to me that we're

305
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
maybe not getting to the crux of the

306
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
conversation we're not communicating

307
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,959
enough maybe we're not getting enough

308
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,040
feedback

309
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
from our stakeholders we're not engaging

310
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,639
with our stakeholders

311
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,959
um for them to provide feedback because

312
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,680
i don't know if you've noticed

313
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,920
right but if you have a a meeting

314
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,440
whether it's teams or zoom or any

315
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,160
platform

316
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,399
and you ask a question and there's 20

317
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,000
people there

318
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,240
you'll generally have tumbleweeds

319
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,240
you won't have anybody saying anything

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,839
if you do have people saying something

321
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,760
it will be the loud people who always

322
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
talk or the hippo

323
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,639
right you heard that expression that the

324
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
highest

325
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,079
hippo highest paid

326
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,160
individual in the room that's the hippo

327
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,399
right so either either people don't feel

328
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,839
like they can talk they don't feel like

329
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
it's a forum

330
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
within which they can

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,920
voice their opinions or they don't

332
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
really feel invited they feel like it's

333
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,800
a platitude

334
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,720
right

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,440
so there's a couple of techniques you

336
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
can use in there what one is

337
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
um

338
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,079
i i can't remember the the

339
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,560
the name of the technique

340
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,360
but it's you make sure you get an

341
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,760
affirmative or a negative

342
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,959
from everybody in the room everybody has

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,800
to say either yes or no and we take them

344
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,040
not saying anything as they totally

345
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,519
disagree with what we say so are you

346
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
happy with this product i want to hear a

347
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
yes from everybody that can be a

348
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,920
technique you can use to get to get to

349
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,720
that person that's going to say well no

350
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,800
this is this is a problem

351
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,600
right but maybe they didn't want to say

352
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,600
anything and to encourage them to talk

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,519
the other way is do breakout rooms do

354
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,680
smaller exercises leverage those

355
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,480
liberating structures i'll talk about

356
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,600
some of the options uh that i have seen

357
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
work

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
um i would also say that everything i

359
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,199
say is what i've seen work

360
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,199
in

361
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,959
the contexts within which i've been

362
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,120
working um so peter may have things that

363
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,760
work for him but don't work for me of

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,519
may have things that work for him

365
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
and don't work for me and it's culture

366
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,800
specific as well

367
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,199
the brits can be fairly loud and

368
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,399
obnoxious in meetings the norwegians

369
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,160
could be fairly reserved and

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
not boisterous at all

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
right so you need to take that into

372
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,240
account who is attending your meeting

373
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,720
and what is their culture even within

374
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,199
different companies

375
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,560
uh and then the last one number four i

376
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,880
don't know why i ordered them in that

377
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
weird way but there we go uh sprint

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,680
review has the highest number of

379
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,760
participate participants

380
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,360
making it an expensive event

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
okay so

382
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
this time

383
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,519
all of these statements

384
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,040
are in fact true

385
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,360
and the sprint review is usually your

386
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,079
most expensive event

387
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,800
right you've got two hours

388
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,760
you've got the scrum team so the product

389
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,079
owner

390
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,240
the developers and the scrum master

391
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
and a whole bunch of stakeholders

392
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,160
business people people who care about

393
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
your product

394
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,959
the most people

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
at any time are in that event therefore

396
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,839
is

397
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,519
by definition is the most expensive

398
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,880
event you have

399
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,959
so you want it to be valuable

400
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,040
right if you're wasting people's time

401
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
you'll find that participation will

402
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
decrease

403
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,040
over time because people will stop

404
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
coming back

405
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,120
if you don't show people anything they

406
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,320
care about

407
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,320
they're not going to come back next time

408
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,160
right even if you don't show them

409
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
anything they care about if they're not

410
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,759
engaged and don't see anything they care

411
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,160
about they're definitely not coming back

412
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,759
so we need to figure out how do we

413
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,320
encourage people to participate um in in

414
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,320
that event

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
that

416
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,440
does that sound reasonable for

417
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,920
my answers reasonable anyone to disagree

418
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
with anything

419
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
oh i got a little heart pop up there

420
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,519
that's pretty good

421
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,199
using the tool

422
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,680
using the tools

423
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,519
um

424
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
you need to do that

425
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,959
um

426
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,800
okay so well let's look at

427
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,800
what a sprint review might look like

428
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,920
okay so i've got

429
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,839
a couple of pieces that i want to to to

430
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,959
talk about here and then i've got

431
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,600
um

432
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,560
some little exercises around it

433
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
so the

434
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
the first

435
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
piece to think about

436
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,560
is

437
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,519
what

438
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,440
what's the purpose

439
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
of the sprint review in scrum

440
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
peter

441
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,480
i know i'm putting you on the spot but

442
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
what what do you think the purpose of

443
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
the review is

444
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,880
feedback

445
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
feedback

446
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,040
right it's it's

447
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
part of our empirical process control

448
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
system which scrum is trying to

449
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,519
implement

450
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,559
and empiricism

451
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,799
just means feedback it means

452
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,039
look at what happened and figure out

453
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,600
what to do differently next to make what

454
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,640
happened better the next time around

455
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,280
like that those empirical

456
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,079
feedback loops inspect and adapt all

457
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,360
different ways of saying the same thing

458
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,199
so

459
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,960
the sprint reviews outcome

460
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,360
should be

461
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,760
an understanding of

462
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,520
what we are doing next

463
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,240
and in scrum we store that information

464
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
in a artifact to provide transparency

465
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,840
called the product backlog

466
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,440
right that's where we're transparently

467
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,360
reflecting

468
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,200
what are we going to go do next what's

469
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
the next most important thing to do

470
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,679
what's coming up after that

471
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
right that's where we're reflecting that

472
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
so we need to walk out of the sprint

473
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,360
review

474
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,960
with an updated

475
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,559
product back clock

476
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,440
uh yeah i can put uh

477
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,400
off could you put the link for the mural

478
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,919
in the in the chat just copy it from

479
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
where you're talking

480
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,400
and you have one more question in the

481
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
james jet as well

482
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
i

483
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,120
haven't had that says can you like

484
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,679
what happens so carlos is asking what

485
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,520
happens when the product owner is absent

486
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160
in the sprint review could you share

487
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,039
your opinion on that please that is a

488
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,840
very good question i am going to share

489
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,840
it with a little story i worked with uh

490
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
with an organization in

491
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
uh

492
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
horton

493
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,240
in uh which is about i don't know it's

494
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,840
about two hours south of oslo

495
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,559
i think it is two hours southern one

496
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,559
hour two hours would train one hour yeah

497
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
i always went on the train so it was two

498
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
hours

499
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,120
um

500
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,000
and and

501
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,120
that i had i worked with this team

502
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,720
and they were they were very

503
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,080
i'm actually gonna i'm gonna say

504
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,799
depressed

505
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,480
right they were not a happy team

506
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,080
um they had a very negative outlook on

507
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919
the work they were doing and what they

508
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,840
were doing and i was trying to figure

509
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
out what the problem was

510
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,720
right so i go to the spread the the

511
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
events and see what's going on and at

512
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,799
the sprint review i just asked them

513
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,440
i didn't see anybody new so i was like

514
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,480
who's the product owner

515
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,520
oh oh that's that's that's thor right

516
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
he's he's not here

517
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
like

518
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,280
is

519
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,799
this is usually here

520
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,520
i don't know he doesn't normally come to

521
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,520
the sprint reviews

522
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,880
how how would you feel as a team

523
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,400
if your product owner thought so little

524
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,320
of the work that you were doing

525
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
that they couldn't even be bothered to

526
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,160
come and see what it was you did and how

527
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,120
well it was done

528
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,120
how would that make you feel

529
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,910
probably make you feel like nobody

530
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,720
values your work

531
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,919
[Music]

532
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,159
right

533
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,520
what are the what are the three

534
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,200
uh things that we need

535
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,400
to feel

536
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
like

537
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,480
we're

538
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,200
we can work well as from at drive dan

539
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,880
pink's book drive

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,880
let me remember what the three things

541
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,679
were

542
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
it was autonomy

543
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,559
mastery

544
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,600
and purpose

545
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,360
with the three intrinsic motivations

546
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,720
once you get money off the table when

547
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,799
we're not worried about putting a roof

548
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,960
over our head autonomy mastery and

549
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,520
purpose we want to feel like we're in

550
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,080
control of the work we do

551
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,799
right so scrum facilitates that with our

552
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,960
self-organizing teams selecting the work

553
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,520
at sprint planning

554
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,919
we want to feel like we're good at our

555
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,799
job right that we're learning more

556
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,480
things

557
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,960
mastery of our profession

558
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,799
right and that manifests both in

559
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
professional scrum

560
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,600
right we're doing that part well but

561
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,200
also engineering excellence if you're a

562
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,120
software team

563
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,799
you know are we doing

564
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,480
devops practices are we getting value

565
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,000
from our product are we continually

566
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,159
shipping it to production are we always

567
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,720
increasing quality are we learning from

568
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,679
each other that's that

569
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,120
mastery and then purpose

570
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,960
are we building stuff that matters

571
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,280
do we feel like

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
the stuff we build matters to other

573
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,200
people because otherwise why do i get

574
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,840
out of bed in the morning

575
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,919
if what i do doesn't matter

576
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,720
okay well i won't do it then and we'll

577
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,720
have the same outcome

578
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,720
so how do you create that purpose

579
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,720
for people and the product owner turning

580
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
up to the sprint review is probably one

581
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,720
of the first steps

582
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,000
right if you can't get the product owner

583
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
in you probably can't get the

584
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,039
stakeholders in either

585
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
and isn't he supposed to get them in at

586
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
least on the

587
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,400
that's one of these jobs as well to get

588
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
them together

589
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,120
to showcase what's happening and

590
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,280
what part part of the problem i found

591
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
for this team was that the product owner

592
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,760
also wasn't doing

593
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,960
the product backlog

594
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,799
therefore

595
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,640
the team was building stuff that the

596
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
product owner didn't care about because

597
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,320
the product owner didn't care what they

598
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,760
were working on enough to go update the

599
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,280
product backlog and tell them what to

600
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,200
work on

601
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,919
right so it was one of those vicious

602
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,720
cycles of spiraling down to

603
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,720
mediocrity

604
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
and the question is what was he actually

605
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
doing to

606
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,640
have the title product owner

607
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
sounds like he was not doing

608
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
wasn't doing anything

609
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
so so

610
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,360
but this is where we get to that

611
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,559
difference between

612
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,000
do i have the job title of product owner

613
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,159
or am i fulfilling the accountabilities

614
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
of being a product owner and i don't

615
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,320
really care about the job title part you

616
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
can be called a delivery manager you can

617
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
be called

618
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,200
a product manager you can be called

619
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,360
a project manager right i don't care

620
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,120
what your job title is

621
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,720
uh but somebody needs to take the

622
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,600
accountabilities

623
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,559
of the product owner um which is making

624
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,919
sure that there's a clear transparent

625
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,280
product backlog that reflects

626
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,799
transparency of the future that um

627
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,159
everybody on the team and the

628
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,600
stakeholders

629
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,640
understand

630
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,240
what those things are and then actively

631
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,840
managing that going forward into the

632
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,760
future so

633
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,600
if those things aren't happening that's

634
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
where i would look who's supposed to be

635
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,679
doing that

636
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,000
um so another question in the chat there

637
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,000
how do you get outcomes from the user

638
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,520
uh could you recommend some tips now i'm

639
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,840
not sure i understand outcomes

640
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
uh from from from the user so maybe

641
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,840
need to explain a little bit better but

642
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,159
i think i might answer that question as

643
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
we go through okay how do we get

644
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,760
feedback from the user maybe um

645
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,760
or maybe it could also be that you're

646
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,880
asking how do we know what the outcome's

647
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,840
supposed to be

648
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,600
rather than just being given solutions

649
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,720
which quite often users try and give us

650
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
solutions

651
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,320
so i'm not sure what you mean there

652
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,240
carlos

653
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,200
andre is asking an interesting question

654
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
as well

655
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,400
but can the scrum master be asked to

656
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,120
back up the product owner in their

657
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,840
absence right

658
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,919
and i would ask the question

659
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,279
if a product owner is doing their job

660
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,279
right they are taking those

661
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,159
accountabilities

662
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
then

663
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
they should be

664
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,919
knowing what's happening in the

665
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,559
marketplace

666
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,720
what's happening inside of the business

667
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,200
uh they have relationships and manage

668
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,520
relationships with stakeholders whether

669
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,279
difficult stakeholders negative

670
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,200
stakeholders they still need to manage

671
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,039
those relationships

672
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,360
and and they take all of that

673
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,200
information of what the team wants to do

674
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
what the technical realities of the

675
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
product is

676
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,360
what the

677
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000
business needs are what the commercial

678
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,400
realities are and they funnel all of

679
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,799
that information into here's what we're

680
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,279
going to do next

681
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,520
i'm not sure

682
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,120
that i have often seen scrum masters

683
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
that have the knowledge and skills to do

684
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,039
that

685
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,559
right so it's it's like in a different

686
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,960
set of

687
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,760
experiences

688
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,840
uh

689
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,679
i'm not saying it can't happen

690
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,520
right but i would probably prefer

691
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,000
a business analyst

692
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,760
to be back up for the po because they're

693
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,360
going to have a better understanding of

694
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
what the business needs

695
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,919
than the scrum master might have

696
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,840
or maybe the scrum master is your

697
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,400
business analyst in which case maybe

698
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,360
yes right there's no real rule around

699
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
that

700
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
um

701
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,720
ah so carlos is asking how do we measure

702
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,720
the outcomes um let me kind of let me

703
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
put a pin in that and you ask that in a

704
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,520
in

705
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,679
in a little bit okay

706
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,520
um because i think we might get to that

707
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,840
um so what what do you think we need

708
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,960
going into a sprint review

709
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,880
what's what's

710
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
i i mentioned a couple of things as part

711
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,600
of this funnel

712
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
right one of the things that the product

713
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,679
owner

714
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,600
needs to bring into that story in order

715
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,760
to be able to review discover and

716
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,000
rearrange the product backlog

717
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,520
um to reflect transparency in the future

718
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,919
what should we show what should we have

719
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,919
on here

720
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
you have the sprint goal from the last

721
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,480
sprint so that's what you should be

722
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,480
measuring yourself

723
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,320
different against

724
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,159
because maybe we're measuring our yep we

725
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,679
are likely measuring ourselves against

726
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,400
did we achieve

727
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
the thing that we committed to

728
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,080
yeah

729
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,080
what what else is uh important in this

730
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,200
product strategy giving us the direction

731
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,360
where we want to go so we can align

732
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
flex strategy

733
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,480
yeah absolutely what what's our overall

734
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,720
strategy i would suggest that might be

735
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
uh

736
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,960
a combination of the product vision

737
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,559
and maybe the current

738
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,320
product goal

739
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,080
right

740
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,919
but maybe there's more information there

741
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,880
so i'm happy to put all of those things

742
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,399
on the

743
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
on the list there's probably useful

744
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,880
information

745
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,080
what what what else

746
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,480
remember you your product owner

747
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,320
is spending the money

748
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,559
they're deciding what we're gonna go

749
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,679
work on

750
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,399
so

751
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,360
what what do we need to discuss in order

752
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,360
to try and

753
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,520
be as

754
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,919
right as possible

755
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,200
at this point in time

756
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
in what we're building next

757
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,559
so the value of the product backlog

758
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,559
items

759
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,200
yeah

760
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,279
the value contained within the product

761
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,840
back clock

762
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,840
what about

763
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,880
we we just did this two weeks ago let's

764
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,240
say we're doing two week sprints

765
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
right we just we're doing two week

766
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
sprints

767
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,840
two weeks ago

768
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,840
um what's changed in the last two weeks

769
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,840
you've discovered more

770
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,279
ace or later wants you to inspect the

771
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,840
outcome

772
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
in the chat

773
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,679
yeah so that the the i'm

774
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,279
what is the outcome what's the result of

775
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,880
all of our work

776
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,039
the increment

777
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,440
yeah we need to inspect the increment

778
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,520
the product has changed

779
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,960
in the last two weeks

780
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,679
maybe that means some of the stuff

781
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,200
that's on our backlog we don't need

782
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,679
maybe that means that there's other

783
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,000
stuff we do need because of whatever we

784
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,000
built

785
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,200
right but there's also

786
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,240
changes in the business

787
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,919
right what's happened

788
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,600
in the business in the last two weeks

789
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,960
is their needs and desires exactly the

790
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,960
same as they were two weeks ago

791
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,440
isn't that part of just

792
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,640
having the backlog always

793
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,600
ordered according to what's required

794
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,120
or what's the changing and tide in the

795
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,480
business

796
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,600
so the this is the moment where we we

797
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,039
have all of those stakeholders

798
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,600
as well as the team together

799
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,320
so you mean more reordering the backlog

800
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,159
based on what has changed not because

801
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
if there's a change for it because

802
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,440
otherwise i would expect that to be

803
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,960
always present in order backlog so maybe

804
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,360
there's a change that the product owner

805
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,799
knows about but maybe there's a change

806
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
that they don't

807
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,840
yeah

808
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,679
what's happened in the business

809
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,679
right and then perhaps

810
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,039
market changes if you're building a

811
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,159
commercial product what's what have

812
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,919
competitors been doing

813
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,480
right maybe that's going to impact what

814
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,320
our how our priorities have changed

815
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,720
right what do you think happened in the

816
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,919
sprint first sprint review

817
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,919
at the microsoft teams teams

818
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,919
when uh lockdown happened

819
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,320
right we

820
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,919
we need the world's changed we need to

821
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,919
throw out this backlog and what do we

822
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,000
need now what's the most important thing

823
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,679
we can do to help solve

824
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,360
our users problems now which might

825
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,360
completely different from two weeks ago

826
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,440
right i would argue that is a massive

827
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,039
change that you don't want to wait for

828
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
the sprint reviews

829
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,960
are just for

830
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,240
i i would definitely agree probably

831
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,559
it requires a special session and

832
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,880
something bigger happen yeah

833
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,399
i used a massive example which

834
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,919
definitely i would agree or would

835
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,080
probably have some special things

836
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,320
happening um but what's happening in the

837
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,159
market what competitors are releasing

838
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,919
maybe they've released a feature that

839
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,519
means that users are starting to

840
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,120
gravitate towards your competitors

841
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,799
rather than your product how do you get

842
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
ahead of that

843
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,320
headed off and do that

844
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,240
so we're going to take all of that

845
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,000
information

846
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,640
presented in some way and bring it into

847
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,039
everybody's consciousness their frontal

848
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,080
lobe so we can noodle on it and have

849
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,080
discussions about it

850
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,640
so

851
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,960
we don't just need stakeholders but we

852
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,200
need the right stakeholders for the

853
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,039
conversations that we need to have so

854
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,679
your right of the product owner probably

855
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,760
needs to have some understanding of what

856
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,600
do i want to discuss walking into the

857
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,080
sprint review so i can invite some of

858
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,240
the right stakeholders

859
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,279
right some stakeholders are going to

860
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,279
come every sprint

861
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,960
because you're building stuff they care

862
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,440
about so they want to provide you with

863
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
feedback

864
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,640
so stakeholders is kind of a catch-all

865
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,640
word that they use in scrum which just

866
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,760
means anybody who cares about the

867
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
outcomes

868
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,080
that the team's working on

869
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,000
right so they could be users

870
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,519
could be business people could be

871
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,519
purchasers could be could be anybody

872
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,519
oh no unlock all

873
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,279
so i have a little flow

874
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,600
ah

875
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,200
uh carlos is asking

876
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,519
who who should present the sprint review

877
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,080
that's a good question and i'm going to

878
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
going to be answering that almost almost

879
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,640
right now

880
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,840
because what i have here

881
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,840
let me

882
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,039
that was going to be my next thing i'm

883
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,480
going to unlock this and just move it

884
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,880
out the way because i want to i want to

885
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,000
use it

886
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,080
so the first thing

887
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,360
that we probably want to do

888
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,159
during a sprint review is level set

889
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,000
everybody this was i think it was anna

890
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,440
came right out and said

891
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
um

892
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,799
you know what what's this product

893
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,399
strategy

894
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,559
is the product strategy the same as it

895
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,240
was two weeks ago maybe it is but maybe

896
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,200
we just need to reaffirm it maybe the

897
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,440
people that are there don't remember it

898
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,879
so let's reaffirm what's the current

899
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,879
vision and goal of the product

900
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:25,440
right and maybe we just show that

901
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:29,919
right but who who who who owns that

902
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,919
vision product goal strategy

903
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,560
product owner owns that so who's best

904
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,560
placed

905
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,359
to have that conversation

906
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,879
right honor

907
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,240
product toner is

908
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,760
like the

909
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,240
i don't know

910
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,200
you could use analogy of a ring master

911
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,000
of the the the event

912
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,240
right

913
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
um they're the hosts

914
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,680
who's

915
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
for them they own the product backlog

916
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,200
and the purpose of the event is to

917
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,040
update the product backlog therefore

918
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,680
it's in their best interest that it's

919
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,680
successful

920
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,520
um syed's asking who is allowed to be at

921
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,640
scrum meetings

922
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,200
anybody who you think has got input

923
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,680
valuable input should be there

924
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,880
so the product owner the scrum master

925
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,880
and the developers are always there

926
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,359
and then

927
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,359
there's the stakeholders which is

928
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,320
can be anybody it can be senior

929
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,440
leadership it can be actual users of

930
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,680
your product

931
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
it can be anybody

932
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,720
i worked with a company in the uk

933
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,960
uh and they ended up having to

934
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,920
they had one of those

935
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,920
um like all hands meeting rooms

936
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
in their company headquarters and they

937
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,920
would fill that for a spring review

938
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,520
they'd be hard pushed to fit the hundred

939
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,520
people that turned up

940
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,720
to see their sprint reviews

941
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,720
right but it took them months of

942
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,320
what do you really want

943
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,680
and once you start building things that

944
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,960
people want

945
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,359
they'll want to come and provide you

946
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,359
feedback

947
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,720
right they don't want to provide you

948
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,000
feedback on stuff they don't care about

949
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,000
so maybe share the goal

950
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,880
and then

951
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,520
does everybody remember what the sprint

952
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,680
goal was last sprint

953
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,760
perhaps not so we need to share that as

954
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,960
well and again that would be

955
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,960
the product owner sharing that

956
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,240
right

957
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,520
and then maybe in some way we want to

958
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,520
demonstrate the working software

959
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,599
who's best place to demonstrate the

960
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,599
working software

961
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,280
with the team wouldn't it

962
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,200
they're the ones who just built it

963
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
they should be able to explain to the

964
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,520
stakeholders what it is they've done and

965
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,440
why it matters to the stakeholders

966
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,960
we're building value after all not

967
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,040
features

968
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,680
right nobody really cares about user

969
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,720
stories and features they care about

970
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,720
value

971
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,440
what do i get from what you've just

972
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,720
added tell some stories

973
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,040
right that's the way i i i i story

974
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,400
telling is the best way to do that um so

975
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,400
there's a number of techniques that i've

976
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,040
seen work really well

977
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,560
in demonstrating the software um

978
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,000
depending on how many if you've just got

979
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,400
one team

980
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,079
right doing a doing a presentation maybe

981
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,040
they just present here's what we changed

982
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,520
right if you've got 10 teams

983
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,240
that might take too much time

984
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,480
so uh maybe you need something that

985
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,440
looks more like uh have you seen in

986
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,760
those american movies when the the the

987
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,880
the the kids have their science fair at

988
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
the school

989
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,599
and you've got a bunch of stations each

990
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,359
presenting a different thing

991
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,400
and people go to the things they care

992
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,920
about that's the science fair model and

993
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,520
that can be implemented virtually as

994
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,480
well with breakout rooms and there's

995
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,880
various techniques for that um but doing

996
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
that might be good uh doing some kind of

997
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,079
shift and share if you've got a lot of

998
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
stakeholders

999
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
shift and share is when you send people

1000
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,079
out to breakout rooms and each breakout

1001
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,520
room is a particular feature or part of

1002
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,599
the product that one of the teams has

1003
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,400
been working on and then you have the

1004
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,920
attendees move to the next room the next

1005
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,440
room the next room

1006
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,280
uh in order to to facilitate that i've

1007
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
done that one in teams

1008
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,119
um

1009
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,880
and it it works in zoom as well

1010
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,520
but

1011
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,079
how many teams should a sprint review

1012
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:47,839
have shouldn't it be per team kind or

1013
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,839
rent review per product

1014
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,800
so if you have 10 teams working on one

1015
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,800
product you show one

1016
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,440
unified working increment to the

1017
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,440
stakeholders

1018
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,040
because you've only got one product so

1019
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,880
we're doing a review of the increment

1020
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,040
and we have one increment

1021
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,720
we don't 10 teams working on the same

1022
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,000
product don't create 10 different

1023
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
increments

1024
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,520
because then that's not integrated

1025
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
together

1026
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,839
therefore wouldn't meet a definition of

1027
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,839
done

1028
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,079
and that sounds good

1029
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,599
so what what a lot of teams do or what a

1030
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,800
lot of product management does

1031
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,599
is um they they create some kind of

1032
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,599
alignment in their product to minimize

1033
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,320
the number of people that are

1034
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,160
part of each of these stories right

1035
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
so if you look at the way and the

1036
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,920
example i always use examples from the

1037
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,560
azure devops team because

1038
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,920
um i i i've been working with them for a

1039
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,440
long time uh but they all over the part

1040
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
of the eight years of their transition

1041
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,480
towards agility was they shifted their

1042
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,920
product

1043
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,200
from one big ball of string

1044
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,240
right

1045
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,240
to

1046
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,839
almost like verticals

1047
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,880
of here's a and it's now called as your

1048
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,119
boards

1049
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,800
right the graphical representation of

1050
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,960
the work that you're doing

1051
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
so there's one product owner for one

1052
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,560
product

1053
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,280
and then that product owner maybe has

1054
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,640
two or three teams working for them

1055
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
and those two or three teams are

1056
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,400
contributing to that single unified

1057
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,800
product so you have one backlog

1058
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,680
one product owner

1059
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,920
one

1060
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,160
maybe one sprint planning or are like a

1061
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,160
pre-planning and one sprint review

1062
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,640
yeah but are you would you do one sprint

1063
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,400
review for all five products in that

1064
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
if i had

1065
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,280
if i had five products different

1066
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,800
products i would maybe have

1067
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,040
five different

1068
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,440
reviews yes

1069
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,200
yeah but your the usher devops is now

1070
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,480
becoming a then a

1071
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,800
mixed sample or mixed example because

1072
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,960
now they're five different product

1073
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,400
five different products which

1074
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,960
each of them

1075
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,160
so at the small scale

1076
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,079
right there is only one right answer

1077
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,760
one product

1078
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,160
one product backlog

1079
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,680
one product owner

1080
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,560
right

1081
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,000
but once you scale up to larger

1082
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,000
interconnected systems

1083
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,040
maybe some of those systems are their

1084
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,000
own products that can be shaped on their

1085
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,680
own but i would suggest if it ships

1086
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,520
together

1087
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
it needs to be reviewed together

1088
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,240
right so if you have a product where

1089
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:46,000
you're breaking it up by component

1090
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,480
rather than by vertical value streams

1091
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,720
then you probably nee you probably

1092
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,359
forced into the larger review where

1093
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,280
you've got one bigger product and now

1094
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,680
when you do have a much larger review

1095
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,960
something the azure devops team did do

1096
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,839
um was

1097
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,200
prior to their sprint

1098
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,520
review every team would create a video

1099
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,880
to present the demo of what it was they

1100
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,480
created and send that out to everybody

1101
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,800
so

1102
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,520
it's been my experience for the big for

1103
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,480
big projects or big programs to do one

1104
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,359
one

1105
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,599
um demo for the whole project product

1106
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,680
have you want to describe it um and at

1107
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,359
one level you could say well i was

1108
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,359
looking after data migration did i

1109
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,280
really care that much about the user

1110
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,200
experience at the other end of the

1111
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
the data flow but it was still useful to

1112
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
hear someone say

1113
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
what we want to see next sprint is we

1114
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,839
want to see the um

1115
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,319
events

1116
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,400
so then that would actually inform me

1117
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,960
why people were then chasing me to

1118
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,359
migrate events from the database

1119
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,680
through the entire value chain so even

1120
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,359
though i normally didn't care it

1121
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,880
actually provided me and my team with

1122
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,880
some useful some some useful feedback um

1123
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,960
they

1124
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,359
we can't load this data

1125
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,440
whatever x y and zed data so we're not

1126
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,200
going to display in the ux for another

1127
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,119
couple of weeks so that would that

1128
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,800
inform the guys other end of the flow

1129
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,640
well let's not plan any work around

1130
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,319
trying to get that data in

1131
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,319
because the migration team aren't going

1132
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,119
to get it to us for a few sprints so

1133
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,520
it's

1134
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,119
it is it is useful for everyone to hear

1135
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,880
at least five or ten minutes what

1136
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,920
everyone else is trying to achieve

1137
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,640
yeah the the other teams are also

1138
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,560
stakeholders to your

1139
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,800
input or output maybe some of those

1140
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,240
teams are providing output that is your

1141
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,000
input

1142
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,800
right and maybe you're providing output

1143
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,560
that is their input they they're blocked

1144
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,240
from delivering some features until

1145
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,680
you've got something

1146
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,680
there for them

1147
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,839
right so it's that whole context

1148
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,040
that is important in the demonstration

1149
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,920
and so

1150
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,599
i do agree of that there are scale

1151
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,359
issues and you have to figure out what

1152
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,760
practices work

1153
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,800
uh the nexus framework which is

1154
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:06,839
scrum.org scaling framework and

1155
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:10,560
encourages having a single sprint

1156
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,560
review but it does

1157
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,440
talk about it being for up to nine to

1158
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,200
ten teams

1159
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,720
working together if you get more than

1160
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,480
that you probably want to spread it into

1161
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,319
i think they have a i can't remember

1162
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,359
what the phrase is but it's nexus of

1163
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,640
nexus

1164
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,200
right you might have multiple nexi uh uh

1165
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,119
uh that roll up to a single product

1166
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,119
it's just more complicated and the

1167
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,560
example that i think sits well with with

1168
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,119
what you're talking about over as i i

1169
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,599
think about the office team right

1170
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,280
the office team sharepoint is not really

1171
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,319
that dependent upon

1172
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,640
words but word exists also as a separate

1173
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,200
app but also inside of sharepoint so

1174
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,599
maybe there are is a lot of crossover

1175
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,720
um but they've got nine nine hundred

1176
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,680
people

1177
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,200
ish working on that product

1178
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,920
um so

1179
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,680
how might they organize that to be

1180
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,680
to get the information to the people

1181
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,119
that need it the feedback from the

1182
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,160
people that need to provide that

1183
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,800
feedback

1184
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,599
um it's figuring out what works at scale

1185
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,000
there are no hard rules at scale there's

1186
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,560
so many different options there

1187
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,560
yeah i'm just seeing some you said it

1188
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,800
was up to four hours yeah i know it's

1189
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,200
just a number but up to four hours for a

1190
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,520
one month sprint and you should be able

1191
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,960
to fill it but then if you are done

1192
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,200
three teams

1193
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,040
are you at 12 hours then

1194
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,359
no it's still

1195
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:39,200
it's still one sprint

1196
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,800
so what what i've seen work and actually

1197
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,319
what one of the teams that

1198
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
peter was working with

1199
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,480
um

1200
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,160
they they

1201
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,160
had a tight a time box inside the sprint

1202
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,880
maybe each day i think there was six

1203
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,560
teams and maybe each team gets seven

1204
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,000
minutes to show their stuff or maybe it

1205
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
was only five minutes to show their

1206
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,680
stuff

1207
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,720
uh i i so you're definitely bringing it

1208
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,280
down

1209
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,440
a little bit but what

1210
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,960
i found valuable

1211
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,680
was once they got into our cadence of

1212
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,480
having those discussions about how do we

1213
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,760
fit all six teams inside of this sprint

1214
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,839
review

1215
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,960
they started talking about telling a

1216
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,079
story

1217
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,000
rather than just showing here's i added

1218
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,400
this feature to the product

1219
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,880
okay but why did we add that feature how

1220
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,520
does that fit into the story of what

1221
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,599
these six teams are trying to build

1222
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,880
and that started to then add more

1223
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,040
context and so that it was even more

1224
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,040
targeted feedback on

1225
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,880
well we've built this part of the story

1226
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,599
maybe we need to focus on this part of

1227
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,880
the story next because then we can have

1228
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,599
a holistic view of what's going on

1229
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,119
it's generally to illicit conversations

1230
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
the more conversations you have

1231
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,119
hopefully uh

1232
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,119
the the better the outcomes

1233
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,280
uh but that was demonstrating

1234
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,400
yes doesn't say if you if you are time

1235
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,000
boxed

1236
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
then you can always say at the end now

1237
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,280
we covered off a b and c if you want

1238
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
more information you know where to find

1239
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,359
us

1240
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,880
yeah so if someone is particularly

1241
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,640
interested in

1242
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,920
i don't know you know some example then

1243
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,280
you should always have that as an open

1244
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,920
invitation

1245
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,800
did you find that that happened a lot

1246
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,800
uh

1247
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,160
yeah but we're all on the same floor

1248
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,520
in one big building so it wasn't

1249
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,640
difficult people would actually would

1250
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,400
actually come and get you immediately

1251
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,400
afterwards if you'd said something that

1252
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,079
their areas pricked up on they wouldn't

1253
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,640
they wouldn't dive deep into it then and

1254
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,079
there because they can be very expensive

1255
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,160
but they will come and see you

1256
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,680
afterwards and say you would say you

1257
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,599
weren't going to shift this

1258
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,200
this information we actually only want a

1259
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,640
tiny amount could you actually

1260
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,079
prioritize that that's the sort of thing

1261
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,520
that people would say uh after that

1262
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,880
event

1263
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,319
you know maybe even three or four scrum

1264
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,400
masters get together and try and work

1265
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:52,319
out exactly what we could deliver in

1266
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,240
terms of you know to the overall to

1267
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,720
overall product if someone wanted to

1268
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,400
specific for some very you know high

1269
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,640
value reason

1270
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,640
yep

1271
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,839
so that that that gets to that

1272
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,760
collecting feedback

1273
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,079
how are we going to collect feedback

1274
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,000
from people especially when we're in the

1275
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,920
virtual space because most of us are

1276
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,319
operating almost 100

1277
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,599
in that virtual world and it's even more

1278
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,280
difficult

1279
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,760
to get feedback from people you can't

1280
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,599
just look at the person who you know has

1281
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,839
some feedback or

1282
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,680
see it as easily on their face if they

1283
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,559
don't have their cameras on

1284
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,640
um so the the the two

1285
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,839
types of exercises that i've done with

1286
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,400
teams

1287
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,960
is one two four alls

1288
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,440
right so have them build lists one two

1289
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,760
four alls is about building lists and

1290
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,400
it's one minute on their own creating a

1291
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,400
list two minute in pairs forming it in

1292
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,920
fours and they merge those lists and

1293
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,800
then bring it back to the whole room so

1294
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,119
what are the ideas for what's next

1295
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,359
um there's also another exercise which

1296
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,319
is made up of three parts

1297
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:02,079
that i've used called a what so what now

1298
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,720
what

1299
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,319
right and that's quite an effective way

1300
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,960
uh um

1301
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,200
to to figure out what's next so i've got

1302
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,920
both of those added to the to the to the

1303
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,119
mural as suggestions to go research and

1304
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,559
look at

1305
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,400
and see if it will

1306
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,559
do it both of them are part of

1307
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,960
liberating structures uh so you can go

1308
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
to liberating structures website uh and

1309
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,520
see that there

1310
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,359
um but uh what so what now what i've had

1311
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,240
some really good experiences with it not

1312
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,359
just um in sprint reviews but in other

1313
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,800
other

1314
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,720
areas as well it's quite useful

1315
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,720
technique

1316
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,760
oh so collecting feedback

1317
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,760
um and it's again it's the the team and

1318
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,960
the product owner who are kind of

1319
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,000
hosting hosting that

1320
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,280
and then

1321
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,960
maybe we need to review the business

1322
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,480
changes

1323
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:57,280
right maybe this is where uh uh not only

1324
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,720
do we have the the product owner and the

1325
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,359
team providing input but we've now got

1326
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,200
to bring the stakeholders in as well

1327
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,960
oh well they're providing from

1328
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,000
collecting feedback but

1329
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,839
um they're they're talking

1330
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,079
they are bringing you're saying to the

1331
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,240
stakeholders what's changed in your part

1332
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,400
of the business that you think matters

1333
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,880
to what we're building

1334
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,800
has do is what you need

1335
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,319
changed

1336
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,640
right because if you build stuff that

1337
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,680
people don't need

1338
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,280
they're not going to provide you with

1339
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,119
feedback they're not going to care about

1340
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,200
what you're creating what do those

1341
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,040
people need

1342
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,760
right and what do they need next what's

1343
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,240
the most valuable thing uh we can do for

1344
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,880
them and now what so what now what can

1345
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,200
definitely work in that space as well um

1346
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,800
and maybe those two activities you might

1347
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,960
roll into one

1348
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,720
collecting feedback and business changes

1349
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,200
and having those discussions

1350
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,359
um but i just wanted to be clear that we

1351
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,839
need to make sure we cover both of those

1352
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,839
topics

1353
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,839
and then we need to actually review and

1354
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,599
update the product backlog

1355
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,319
so i i would

1356
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,920
potentially crack open the product back

1357
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,800
clog

1358
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,240
show

1359
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,680
everybody what's at the top of the

1360
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,280
product backlog and are these still

1361
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,800
things we need

1362
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,880
right some of them might be technical

1363
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,480
needs because the team needs to do them

1364
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,400
in order for other things to happen but

1365
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,960
we can have those conversations

1366
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,000
i don't want a stakeholder

1367
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,920
going home fuming why am i not getting

1368
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,079
the thing i want i thought it was more

1369
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,440
important than this other thing but

1370
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,359
actually this other thing is a

1371
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,800
prerequisite of the thing they want if

1372
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,800
they don't understand that they're going

1373
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
to be pissed

1374
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,680
right because they're not getting their

1375
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,160
thing

1376
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,040
i normally publish they draft

1377
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,920
um

1378
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,359
sprint backlog for the next sprint

1379
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,119
and maybe even do it prior to the

1380
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,599
meeting so it's actually circulated in

1381
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,160
advance uh that way people can turn up

1382
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,200
with a pre-prepared opinion

1383
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,640
that that is definitely a good way to to

1384
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,800
prepare people if you have that

1385
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,480
information have a have a have a draft

1386
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,720
of the the

1387
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,480
the goal what do you think what does

1388
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,720
your product owner think the goal is

1389
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,880
going to be for the next sprint

1390
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,559
what are the things that they think in

1391
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,160
collaboration with the team are going to

1392
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,599
be part of that story because they

1393
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,319
should have had those conversations

1394
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,640
during refinement

1395
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,640
right

1396
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,880
oh yes so carlos the one two for all is

1397
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,040
you you have one minute for people to

1398
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,359
write stuff down on their own

1399
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,440
two minutes in pairs

1400
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:40,720
and then you join two of the pairs

1401
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,880
together and they get four minutes uh in

1402
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,400
in effectively two pairs

1403
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,000
and then bring it back to the whole room

1404
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,760
and it's a way to get even the most

1405
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,079
introverted people part of the

1406
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,079
conversation and contributing to the to

1407
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,240
the story definitely gets people out of

1408
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,559
their their their shell you can find it

1409
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,839
on the liberating structures website um

1410
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,319
but i run that i use that judiciously in

1411
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,720
the in the live virtual classroom space

1412
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,000
for sure it's a really good way to to

1413
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,000
break that up and

1414
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,119
stop people feeling like meetings and

1415
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,200
events suck because it's just you know

1416
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,280
broadcast

1417
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,770
it's collaborating on what to do next

1418
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,520
um

1419
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,599
[Music]

1420
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,960
and then the last thing i've got is

1421
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,880
perhaps

1422
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,880
reviewing timelines and budgets

1423
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,920
for the next release

1424
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,319
right we're spending the customers money

1425
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,160
we're spending the businesses money they

1426
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,200
kind of want to know

1427
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,960
how

1428
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,400
how are we spending it and i would

1429
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,200
rather do that in an open and

1430
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,960
transparent public space

1431
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,319
with all of the stakeholders that care

1432
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,720
about that stuff

1433
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,960
then the product owner having

1434
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,359
10 private conversations with a group of

1435
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,440
people having to justify themselves 10

1436
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,760
different times maybe in 10 different

1437
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,680
ways

1438
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,040
right don't let your product owner be

1439
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,440
brow beat

1440
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,880
bro beaten i think is the expression by

1441
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,720
the stakeholders because they get them

1442
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,280
alone in a room

1443
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,680
right have these discussions open and

1444
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,359
transparent

1445
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,520
let's let the stakeholders brow beat

1446
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,280
each other

1447
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,000
rather than the product owner that's the

1448
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,599
way i look at it

1449
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,440
and at the end of the event we've

1450
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,760
updated the product backlog

1451
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,280
we physically updated it

1452
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,440
we've made changes to it we've changed

1453
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,240
the order we've added new things we've

1454
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,240
deleted things

1455
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,119
to me

1456
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,839
that sounds like quite a lot to happen

1457
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,760
in two

1458
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,599
hours sounds like i might struggle for

1459
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,839
time

1460
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,000
right so maybe we can't cover everything

1461
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,079
every sprint review but what's the

1462
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
important things to cover

1463
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,880
especially if you've got big teams off

1464
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,760
right

1465
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,760
so in in

1466
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,240
and that science fair model works really

1467
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,480
well where people just see the ones they

1468
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,480
care about

1469
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,280
uh it was a question

1470
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,720
yeah

1471
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,720
so somebody's asking what what happens

1472
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,839
if i don't get everything done

1473
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,839
for a piece of value

1474
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,160
and i i would say that piece of value is

1475
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,920
not done

1476
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,480
and if you show

1477
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,880
stakeholders something that is half

1478
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,720
finished or even 90 finished

1479
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,920
they're they're not not going to be

1480
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,760
happy

1481
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,680
and if you try and claim that it's

1482
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,760
finished like show them something as if

1483
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,920
it's finished

1484
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,760
it's not really

1485
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,880
morally or ethically

1486
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,200
sound

1487
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,160
i we're basically saying we finished

1488
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,440
this

1489
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,960
don't tell them we haven't finished

1490
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,160
those four things that need to be done

1491
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,240
and we'll do them tomorrow because they

1492
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,760
might get forgotten or the

1493
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,760
the world might have changed tomorrow

1494
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,839
and we need to do something different

1495
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,040
right and that thing never gets done

1496
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,960
don't get caught lying to your

1497
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,280
stakeholders

1498
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,520
open and transparent is kind of the key

1499
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,520
there

1500
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,040
uh so i wanna uh i'm gonna skip this uh

1501
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,319
little exercise i have at the bottom i

1502
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,640
just kind of threw it on because i

1503
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:24,400
didn't know how long this uh the sprint

1504
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,839
review one would take but

1505
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,280
um

1506
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:31,200
that's really the the the the whole

1507
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,559
sprint review that's it that's the whole

1508
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,799
thing

1509
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,200
now you may have additional things i

1510
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,520
know that um when i worked with some

1511
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,440
teams that peter was working with and

1512
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,480
they also had like an architectural

1513
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,799
review

1514
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,960
that happened at the end

1515
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,640
of the sprint review like we're going to

1516
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,480
tack this on because there are people at

1517
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,040
the customer that care about our

1518
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,480
technical decisions that we made

1519
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,760
right that they are invested in it

1520
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,960
because we're going to build a product

1521
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,400
and then we're going to hand it to them

1522
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,240
and they've got to support it so they're

1523
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,960
like we want to know how you built that

1524
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,000
thing so that we can better support it

1525
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,359
cool

1526
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,960
just don't do that at the start of the

1527
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,559
sprint review when the rest of the

1528
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,319
stakeholders who are business focused

1529
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,440
don't care about that stuff do it at the

1530
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:16,000
end that's okay but again do it open and

1531
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,920
transparent try not have another

1532
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,960
meeting right because if you push it off

1533
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:24,160
to another meeting there's other time

1534
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,440
that's taken away from your team

1535
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:30,000
[Music]

1536
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,559
uh carlos is just asking about the the

1537
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,680
the budget um the money that we're

1538
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,280
spending

1539
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,319
right every sprint costs money

1540
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,799
we're we're using people's time so we're

1541
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,240
costing money so so

1542
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,440
what are we going to

1543
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,079
to

1544
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,520
work on over the next few sprints do we

1545
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:52,799
have budget for

1546
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,960
two sprints five sprints ten sprints

1547
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,480
and do we need to go looking for

1548
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,839
additional budget

1549
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,480
um

1550
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah and for me that all sits within the

1551
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,920
scope of the product owner and the

1552
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,559
product owner is

1553
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,319
accountable for value delivery uh

1554
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,400
they're getting money from the business

1555
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,440
and then spending it in some way

1556
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,760
um

1557
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,440
so it depends on your context right if

1558
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,119
you're more in the professional services

1559
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,880
context some of those things might be

1560
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,839
blurred a little bit

1561
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,960
um on who owns what and maybe you've got

1562
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,040
some kind of account manager as well

1563
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,640
right if you're building software i'm

1564
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,799
thinking from an accountabilities rather

1565
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,400
than a job titles perspective and you

1566
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,880
might have somebody that is an account

1567
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,480
manager who has to do the invoicing at

1568
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,880
the end of every sprint because you're

1569
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,720
invoicing an external customer

1570
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,640
that has to talk up the time and make

1571
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,079
sure that you're in budget and

1572
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,760
you know what are our projections

1573
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,119
because you've got internal reporting

1574
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,839
you have to do for your professional

1575
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,520
services organization

1576
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,559
um that might be called a project

1577
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,520
manager

1578
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,920
right it's entirely possible um they

1579
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,799
might also have accountabilities

1580
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,160
outside of that account management um

1581
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,839
they might be uh they might be the

1582
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,760
product owner they might be a scrum

1583
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,280
master or they might be a

1584
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,200
developer on a team

1585
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,720
um

1586
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,200
my preference is to actually provide a

1587
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,720
dashboard that they want everyone and

1588
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,000
anyone can look at that says you know

1589
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,839
this this is

1590
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,359
um you know how many features we've got

1591
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:21,599
to get through you know this is this is

1592
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,880
our current burn up rate

1593
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,880
you know and this is our current

1594
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,200
predicted end date

1595
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,040
for the current product backlog because

1596
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,040
that way it engenders the debate i mean

1597
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,040
if you're not going to finish on time

1598
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,200
then that i'd start the debate early

1599
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,880
about what's not going to get done or

1600
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,200
extending out the timelines because what

1601
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,640
you don't want to do is get you know one

1602
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,319
sprint to go and go we've got six

1603
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,119
minutes more work to do because then

1604
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,040
everyone looks like a full

1605
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,200
yeah we can be we can be opening you

1606
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,160
know at the end of sprint one

1607
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,640
right

1608
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,839
based on our progress this sprint this

1609
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,400
is what

1610
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,720
the rest of our time looks like

1611
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,200
don't we we we've only got one sprint's

1612
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,680
worth of data so it may

1613
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,440
change drastically as we get better at

1614
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,599
delivering in this product as we build

1615
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,400
up more of the infrastructure and get

1616
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,599
faster at delivering features

1617
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,200
but we can start having those

1618
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,880
conversations

1619
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:19,839
yeah and al always bring real data

1620
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,359
i have have have data to look at on

1621
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,480
what's going what's going on with the

1622
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,480
product how we're delivering um

1623
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,760
what our throughput is our

1624
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,680
i use cycle time scatter plots and those

1625
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,400
kind of things with teams

1626
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,839
um definitely definitely a good idea

1627
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,079
i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't do a deep

1628
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,079
dive at the sprint review but i would

1629
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,520
probably just have a graph

1630
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,680
and you know a couple of a couple of

1631
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,160
bullet points that says happy days guys

1632
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,119
we're all ahead of schedule or

1633
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,559
um

1634
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,400
you know that's some great feedback in

1635
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,799
the last two or three sprint reviews but

1636
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,240
our backlog has now grown considerably

1637
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,920
yeah we will not get through all of this

1638
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,400
and that i wouldn't you know go into the

1639
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,400
details but at least make everyone aware

1640
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,920
that that's what your current broad

1641
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,119
branch position is

1642
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,200
yep

1643
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,720
i agree

1644
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,240
but you also need to have a different

1645
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,559
discussion whether or not you're a

1646
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,720
project or a product

1647
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,599
right if you're a product organization

1648
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,119
normally you just iterate

1649
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,720
and push forward

1650
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,960
versus if you're a project where you

1651
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:23,520
have a finite date then those kind of

1652
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,559
things are more important

1653
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,720
so it's also yeah context-wise whether

1654
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,960
or not you're

1655
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,359
in my opinion at least

1656
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,319
even with product based organizations

1657
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,160
you know

1658
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,280
unless you're in a absolutely unique

1659
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,880
position you're always going to have

1660
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,040
competitors you're going to have some

1661
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,799
business drivers that will be setting

1662
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,799
dates even if you know after you've got

1663
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,240
to that particular release the next

1664
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,319
release is three months or where

1665
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,760
whatever thing happens to be

1666
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,680
you still care you still care about

1667
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,680
money you still care about time you

1668
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:56,240
still care about

1669
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,079
yeah but it's more you're

1670
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,240
you might be reporting on two different

1671
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,240
things whether or not you're this is

1672
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,440
part of this release or next release

1673
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,839
versus

1674
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,039
an amount of

1675
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:08,559
money right

1676
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,559
yeah if yeah if you've got if you've got

1677
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,440
a constant number of

1678
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,039
um

1679
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,400
constant team size

1680
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,520
then yeah you thought you wanted the

1681
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,079
debate is about when are you going to

1682
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,240
release a feature

1683
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,599
where if you're more of a software house

1684
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,960
then it's more going to be about when

1685
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,000
are you going to get it getting at the

1686
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,440
end of this

1687
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,640
product project to deliver a product

1688
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,440
typically to your customer

1689
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,559
i

1690
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,799
i yeah i i agree i'm just going to

1691
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,480
answer a question that that side had in

1692
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,319
the chat which i think is very

1693
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,920
interesting so he's asking can you tell

1694
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,359
me about the types of reports that a

1695
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,359
scrum master

1696
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:48,319
should deliver to management

1697
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:51,119
um and i i don't believe a scrub master

1698
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,720
is accountable for any reports

1699
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,440
to management the scrum master

1700
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,039
accountabilities are are are

1701
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,680
generally to the team

1702
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:02,079
essentially to the product owner and

1703
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,839
accountable for the effectiveness of the

1704
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,799
team to management

1705
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,960
um

1706
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:09,280
so the the the

1707
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,079
the flow of value

1708
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,359
right in scrum who is accountable for

1709
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,840
the for the

1710
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:18,239
delivery of value

1711
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,239
[Music]

1712
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,440
so the the person who should be

1713
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:27,200
um writing delivering managing

1714
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,640
maintaining owning

1715
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,839
any reports

1716
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,119
around

1717
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:36,319
budget and timelines uh around

1718
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,480
flow of value and speed of delivery um

1719
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:40,400
should be the product owner they're

1720
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,160
they're the ones who own that

1721
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,680
i'm not saying that they don't get help

1722
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,200
right or that they don't delegate that

1723
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,839
to somebody else that's entirely

1724
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,280
possible um product owners can have

1725
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,640
minions too

1726
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,039
uh but

1727
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,079
um it's definitely not an accountability

1728
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,760
of

1729
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,880
within the countabilities of the scrum

1730
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,319
master

1731
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,920
right it's within the accountabilities

1732
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,280
of the product owner

1733
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,039
and but i know that often ends up in the

1734
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,039
accountabilities of the scrum master

1735
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,760
because the scrum master is treated like

1736
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,520
an agile project project manager right

1737
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,280
rather than

1738
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,680
a scrum master and maybe that's to do

1739
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,480
with multiple accountabilities

1740
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,559
right

1741
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,400
um so i'm not saying that's wrong

1742
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,599
i'm just saying uh

1743
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,559
you need to watch out for that because

1744
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:28,400
it can cause negative behavior

1745
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:30,319
we have we have about 19 uh minutes left

1746
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,690
and i'd really like to

1747
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,079
um

1748
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:33,839
[Music]

1749
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,000
do the next exercise but i'm going to

1750
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,880
have to be a bit of a bit of a time nazi

1751
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,240
here

1752
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,400
um

1753
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,920
because uh

1754
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,640
this this this

1755
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,520
this one i think uh will be fun

1756
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,520
so what i'd like to do

1757
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,599
it's a little exercise it's called the

1758
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,200
tritz all right so i'm going to ask you

1759
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:56,400
a a a negative question so let me summon

1760
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,280
everybody on the mural because we're

1761
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,520
going to use the the the the mural here

1762
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,440
um so what i'd like you to do

1763
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,880
and there's how many how many how many

1764
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,520
folks do we have

1765
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,280
let's see how many oh there's ten of us

1766
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,160
that's ten of us okay

1767
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,839
uh i'd like you to

1768
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,400
uh silently and on your own

1769
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:22,960
generate a list of things that you could

1770
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,960
do to destroy the sprint review

1771
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:26,880
what would make it

1772
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,520
not have the outcomes that we've been

1773
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,520
talking about

1774
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,319
right what could you do what have you

1775
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,680
seen done

1776
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,359
your organizations or other

1777
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,280
organizations

1778
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,039
what's something that you're

1779
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,480
like the one i mentioned product owner

1780
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,960
not turning up

1781
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,559
right that's probably a big no-no

1782
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,599
i'm gonna i'm gonna put that one on the

1783
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,599
list

1784
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,599
uh

1785
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,400
so let me i'm just gonna

1786
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,480
if i can figure out how to do it

1787
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,280
just silently and on your own if you

1788
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,559
want to type in uh something like

1789
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,240
notepad if you do one item on each line

1790
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,240
when you paste it into mural it will

1791
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:20,400
become a bunch of post-its which is

1792
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,400
quite

1793
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:32,230
[Music]

1794
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:36,289
handy ah

1795
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:36,289
[Music]

1796
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,200
so if you oh well this i was going to

1797
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,960
say if you're if you're on linkedin and

1798
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,280
you don't have any sound

1799
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,039
then go to youtube it always works i'm

1800
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,000
thinking of dropping

1801
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,240
the

1802
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,240
no

1803
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,960
you're on mute off so we can't

1804
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:58,000
[Music]

1805
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,559
i opened facebook after notes didn't

1806
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,559
mean that a little while ago and it

1807
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,240
seems that there is one

1808
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,640
sound noise

1809
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,160
oh well that's

1810
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,920
so last time you had echo and now you

1811
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,920
have nothing so

1812
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:15,200
okay well

1813
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:17,599
i i i it looks like it's pumping out

1814
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,119
sound but if there's no sound i'm sorry

1815
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,079
guys

1816
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,880
um

1817
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,559
i'm

1818
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,240
the important people are the people that

1819
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,920
turned up

1820
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,039
so

1821
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,400
i didn't want to break your flow on it

1822
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,079
so

1823
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,599
totally cool

1824
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,280
and i can probably get to say i'm doing

1825
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,280
a teams recording as well so i can

1826
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,920
probably get the sound off that and

1827
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:43,200
do some kind of magic

1828
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:45,520
so i'm going to open a a a breakout room

1829
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,680
and put you in pairs

1830
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,760
so if anybody leaves i'll be very

1831
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,960
unhappy because some well other somebody

1832
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,520
else will be unhappy as well because

1833
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,559
there will be an empty room

1834
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,520
um

1835
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,280
so i'm going to create five rooms

1836
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,039
i will be going into a room as well oh

1837
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:02,799
well that's not gonna work somebody left

1838
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,400
just last minute

1839
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:07,680
um

1840
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,680
so let me fix that

1841
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,440
oh okay no that works

1842
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,640
i am good

1843
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,120
so um what i'd like you to do

1844
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,520
is in pairs i want you to compare the

1845
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,679
lists you just made of of these things

1846
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,319
that could destroy your sprint review

1847
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,799
and merge them together into one list

1848
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,440
and then i'll join two pairs together

1849
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,679
that will be a group of six as well um

1850
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,560
and merge those lists again

1851
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,480
okay

1852
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,920
so then we end up with one list d-duped

1853
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,359
deduped

1854
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,679
at the end when we bring it all back

1855
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,679
together

1856
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,199
uh what i was going to say actually

1857
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,199
um

1858
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,759
i'm going to add an extra one which is

1859
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,759
internal politics

1860
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,319
internal politics

1861
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,199
resize them all so that we can we can

1862
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,799
read them a little bit better

1863
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,960
i don't know if that helped or hindered

1864
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,960
but

1865
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,560
bit small box now

1866
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,719
no

1867
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,239
product owner not turning up not getting

1868
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,359
feedback

1869
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,359
people not engaging

1870
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:32,239
oh as there's two not providing feedback

1871
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,359
so i'm gonna delete one

1872
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,920
rushing

1873
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,799
not allowing enough time i i i see quite

1874
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,120
often

1875
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:41,279
teams putting 15 minutes for a sprint

1876
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:44,080
review on their calendar

1877
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:46,560
right that's not enough time to do half

1878
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,799
of the things that we're talking about

1879
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,640
in here if your sprint planning's 15

1880
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:52,159
minutes and your retrospective is 15

1881
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,199
minutes i'm i'm a little bit worried

1882
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:55,840
about

1883
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:56,640
um why we're not getting

1884
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,400
uh

1885
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,560
enough value

1886
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,560
uh

1887
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,520
for that uh criticism

1888
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,560
celebrating

1889
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,719
of how people are doing it so at least

1890
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,560
in my case we've noticed we had big big

1891
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:15,199
sprint reviews of

1892
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,600
60 people seven teams

1893
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:19,679
so you could see people that were giving

1894
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,360
time to focus on the high level but they

1895
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,440
were going into so much detail that no

1896
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,880
matter how much time you would give them

1897
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:28,400
it still would be rushed because they

1898
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,400
would just pack more details into it

1899
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,719
yeah so um

1900
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,120
having

1901
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,760
having a plan up front

1902
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,880
before going into sprint planning

1903
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,679
um

1904
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,960
knowing what you want your the teams to

1905
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:47,520
talk about

1906
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,760
uh what i mean the this is a uh uh

1907
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,159
a presentation on the of the work that

1908
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,199
was done in the state of

1909
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:58,239
the product to the stakeholders

1910
01:10:55,199 --> 01:11:01,360
um so i would want to be actively

1911
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:03,360
working with the product owner before i

1912
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,719
walk into the sprint review and spending

1913
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,400
a little bit of time what are we going

1914
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,840
to talk about how are we going to

1915
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,280
approach it what are we going to demo

1916
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,360
what are we not going to demo because

1917
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,080
the stakeholders just don't care

1918
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,600
right we might have had to build stuff

1919
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,440
to support other stuff that the

1920
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,280
stakeholders don't care about

1921
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,000
right there's no point in presenting

1922
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,400
that at the sprint review

1923
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,800
so how do we get down to

1924
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,560
these are the values

1925
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,800
the value that we provided to

1926
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,120
stakeholders so that we can then iterate

1927
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,320
on the next piece of value and and i

1928
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:39,400
think that

1929
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,400
focus on value is sometimes lost

1930
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,320
any other um

1931
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,320
highlights

1932
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:00,159
uh maybe i want to uh ask about

1933
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,679
something in here i mean like it's in my

1934
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:03,679
mind it's uh

1935
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,320
like plus and minus

1936
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,199
persons because uh about the criticism

1937
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,440
uh

1938
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,800
what do you think about it like

1939
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,920
uh is

1940
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,800
the criticism is uh kind of feedback

1941
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,840
through

1942
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,159
or

1943
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,120
is it just negative

1944
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,800
so the there's constructive feedback

1945
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,719
yeah that is

1946
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,840
negative about what it is we did

1947
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:31,760
and then those um

1948
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,920
was that carlos or andre andre that was

1949
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,719
asking the question

1950
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:39,280
andre andre um

1951
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,679
andre that that that question sucks and

1952
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,040
i don't like the way you said it

1953
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,280
okay

1954
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:47,360
that's not that's not constructive

1955
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,320
feedback

1956
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,440
right

1957
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,280
right yeah

1958
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,960
so so

1959
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:56,400
it's if you think of the scrum values

1960
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,000
we want to be

1961
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,320
openness

1962
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,480
right and courage

1963
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,840
to say that things are wrong

1964
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,920
but respectful i don't know we see it

1965
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,760
and it's it's not respectful to have

1966
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,600
some hippo in the room saying to the

1967
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,360
team that that that you suck and

1968
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,560
everything you did sucks

1969
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,640
and

1970
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,719
your products suck you know that that's

1971
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,640
not to create a positive response in

1972
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:23,840
anybody

1973
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,120
so so part of the

1974
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:30,239
the role of the scrum master

1975
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:32,239
is helping

1976
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,640
everybody interacting with the scrum

1977
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:36,800
team understand what interactions are

1978
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,920
helpful and what aren't

1979
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,280
as well

1980
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,440
so maybe the if that that that person

1981
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,679
who's like that is is going to be

1982
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,000
participating maybe the scrum master

1983
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:50,239
needs to go maybe coach them and help

1984
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,080
them understand

1985
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,520
how do we create

1986
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,600
positive

1987
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,840
interactions not negative interactions

1988
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,159
and you can be critical posit in a

1989
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,400
positive way

1990
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:06,000
right and it's about the way we speak to

1991
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,760
people the language we use it it it is

1992
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,400
really important

1993
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,280
and it's culturally specific as well

1994
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,360
right

1995
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,880
so what what works in

1996
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,840
when i'm when i'm when i'm teaching

1997
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,080
classes what works in saudi arabia it

1998
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,920
doesn't work in the uk it doesn't work

1999
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:26,320
in norway right uh the way people

2000
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,800
hear things is different the way people

2001
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,480
um react is different so you need to

2002
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,040
bring some of that into it and when you

2003
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,320
do have a multicultural team think about

2004
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,800
those things

2005
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,960
um it's specifically important for the

2006
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,280
scrub master but the whole team needs to

2007
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,840
be involved in being as effective as

2008
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,840
possible

2009
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,920
i would add to it that even even if the

2010
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,080
criticism is constructive but all you do

2011
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,840
on every sprint review is just focus on

2012
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,440
the negative it really damages the

2013
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,480
team's morale

2014
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,960
um

2015
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,360
in the past we had quite an experienced

2016
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,199
c-level management and we always had

2017
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,120
this very vague

2018
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:06,880
um

2019
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,320
yeah feedback like oh yeah we don't like

2020
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,080
it but they didn't know why they didn't

2021
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,600
know the direction where we should move

2022
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,000
forward with that

2023
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,840
and what happened in the end it's like

2024
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,360
we would release let's say

2025
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,719
seven different things that bring value

2026
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,760
to the customer

2027
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,840
um it was in timely matter my manner it

2028
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,080
was everything was correct but they were

2029
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,719
ignored because everybody focused on

2030
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,640
this eighth thing that was not

2031
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,800
fully up to the standards

2032
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,560
and once you once you hear it every two

2033
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,800
weeks or every four weeks

2034
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,199
that everything you do is wrong and all

2035
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,400
the wins are being ignored or like not

2036
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,400
being

2037
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,520
acknowledged in the room

2038
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:47,360
then yeah it changes the whole dynamic

2039
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,960
in the team as well so i would say like

2040
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,199
the first point of routing in our

2041
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,880
company was to share the stakeholders

2042
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:54,159
okay it's perfectly fine if you don't

2043
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,440
like something

2044
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:59,520
but a as you mentioned constructively so

2045
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,560
tell us you know what you want us to do

2046
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,040
with it

2047
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,880
and second do acknowledge all the wins

2048
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,080
as well to to build up the the teams

2049
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,820
yep

2050
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,480
i i i would probably

2051
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:15,199
[Music]

2052
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:18,080
i would probably want to break the

2053
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:19,840
stakeholders up into smaller groups

2054
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,800
and to talk about those things because

2055
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,080
quite often i i and i found this a weird

2056
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,760
thing

2057
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,679
the introverts

2058
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,840
right don't want to speak when there's a

2059
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,840
large group of people

2060
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,239
but the extroverts are quite happy being

2061
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,640
loud and obnoxious when there's a large

2062
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,640
group of people but they're not as happy

2063
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,000
to to be like that when it's a small

2064
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,920
group of people

2065
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,440
because i i think

2066
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,600
i think

2067
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,760
and this is just martin thinks

2068
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,679
i think psychologically

2069
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,840
if you're an extrovert and there's a

2070
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,199
large group of people you feel like you

2071
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,120
can say anything because you're

2072
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:57,679
anonymous because it's a large group of

2073
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:59,520
people and it doesn't matter

2074
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:03,440
right but when it's a smaller group of

2075
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:04,880
people it feels more intimate

2076
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,360
well you're more likely to be challenged

2077
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,960
though i would suggest it's smaller

2078
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,960
you're also more likely to be challenged

2079
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,800
than a small group of people and yeah

2080
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,480
yeah so you're talking complete rubbish

2081
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,640
there martin by the way

2082
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,000
okay thank you for that

2083
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,520
it's a nice small group i think that in

2084
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,600
a very positive and constructive way

2085
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,600
obviously

2086
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,320
um so so so

2087
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:29,360
uh breaking people breakout rooms are i

2088
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:32,080
think are really important in all of

2089
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,320
the exercises that we do but having

2090
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,120
structure around what you want people to

2091
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,320
do

2092
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,320
um we we just did the oh and carlos

2093
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:43,040
that's the one two for all

2094
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,600
um that's the exercise we just did to

2095
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,360
generate a list of things

2096
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,239
um and and

2097
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,960
i use this in meetings i use this

2098
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:56,000
when i'm uh you know somebody asks in

2099
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,600
the in the room oh you know what should

2100
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,760
we do next

2101
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,600
right and that that's a very vague

2102
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,920
question but if you ask what could we do

2103
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,679
next and you write get people to do the

2104
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,920
one two four all right sound stuff on

2105
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,280
your own you'll generate a list of

2106
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,280
things like here's what's important next

2107
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,440
um and then maybe get people to vote on

2108
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,880
it right what's the the most important

2109
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,400
thing because you may not have thought

2110
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,640
of something that somebody else thought

2111
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:22,719
of but it's actually more important than

2112
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,600
the things that you thought of

2113
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,679
do some kind of voting and then you know

2114
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,600
okay maybe maybe this is the thing that

2115
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,679
we need to focus on now

2116
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:36,400
um and

2117
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:40,239
it's um really important to to

2118
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:42,640
get that collaborative environment right

2119
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:45,760
and it can be difficult because when

2120
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,960
you've got big groups of people um it

2121
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,239
can be it can be very difficult to do

2122
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,760
that what what one of the the six teams

2123
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:54,960
uh one that i was working with with

2124
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,840
peter before and there was what 70 80

2125
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,239
people

2126
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,040
in the in the sprint review

2127
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,840
i think it was something like that

2128
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,000
well

2129
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,719
with that with that team the

2130
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,840
the sort of business users gave positive

2131
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,840
feedback

2132
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,640
it was it was

2133
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,800
you know it was the technical people and

2134
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,640
you know as we all know from experience

2135
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,360
you know no solution architect has ever

2136
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,120
been wrong on any subject whatsoever

2137
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,880
and therefore anybody else has come to a

2138
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,600
different way of doing it

2139
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,360
is clearly an absolute imbecile and

2140
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,080
should be fired

2141
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,280
uh if not taken outside and hung

2142
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,040
and

2143
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,920
where business users are more inclined

2144
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,280
to say well i don't understand the

2145
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,520
technology don't really care about that

2146
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,400
but what i want to talk about is value

2147
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,520
and

2148
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,640
the the the developers want to deliver

2149
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,400
value

2150
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,600
and so that's that's an applicable

2151
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,600
conversation

2152
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,440
it's well i think your i think your

2153
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,600
application is too chatty or why are you

2154
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,199
using that database or

2155
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,880
you know why aren't you using that yeah

2156
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,880
that's that's the people that developers

2157
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,120
will die in a ditch

2158
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,719
over over that stuff

2159
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,920
having it yeah

2160
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,800
absolutely

2161
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,520
um

2162
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,520
and and i think we we need to maintain

2163
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,360
that focus on value

2164
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,800
right what what are we delivering that

2165
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,639
people care about

2166
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,400
because nobody gives a crap about what

2167
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,719
technology the database was in apart

2168
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,199
from a few pedantic people like peter

2169
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,400
say

2170
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:22,480
right it doesn't it doesn't help it

2171
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,320
doesn't help the users to know that

2172
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,480
well like you could you could argue that

2173
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,960
it's critical for um

2174
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,679
cost of ownership

2175
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,239
i

2176
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,280
i don't i don't disagree with that right

2177
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,400
anyway

2178
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,080
my point is you need to have a

2179
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,719
reasonable and advocal debate about

2180
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:42,239
about that based on

2181
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,760
well i think that x is a crap database

2182
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:45,280
because it won't do why and you think

2183
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,520
it's a brilliant case there's something

2184
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,400
else what's the business value that x or

2185
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,400
y

2186
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,480
brings to bear that's that's where the

2187
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,719
debate should be not your opinion versus

2188
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,080
my opinion clearly i'm correct

2189
01:20:54,719 --> 01:21:00,800
but we can quickly move on now

2190
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,080
you are correct peter that that's how

2191
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,920
you get those potential people to be

2192
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,239
quiet you just agree with them

2193
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,239
um

2194
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,239
i'm just messing with you peter

2195
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,520
i'll be with you

2196
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:15,840
i know

2197
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:18,239
so you can tell peter and i have been in

2198
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,040
quite a lot of meetings together

2199
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,239
so

2200
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,840
um

2201
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:25,520
i i these are the these are the things

2202
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,400
to watch out for

2203
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,159
um

2204
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,280
and even if it's small like like uh in

2205
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,000
magda's

2206
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:36,560
uh version if it even if it's just a

2207
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,480
little bit negative all the time

2208
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,400
that can build up to that death of a

2209
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,639
thousand cuts for a team

2210
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:44,000
um and end up in that spiral of

2211
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,000
negativity

2212
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,159
um trying to

2213
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,400
bring it down to

2214
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,920
what's the smallest thing we can deliver

2215
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,000
if we feel like we're never meeting our

2216
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,360
sprint goals we're probably taking on

2217
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,880
too much work

2218
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,199
right or we've got the wrong sprint

2219
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:02,480
goals fix those things

2220
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:03,520
create a virtuous cycle supporting the

2221
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,520
team

2222
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,840
and what it is they're trying to do

2223
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,880
and hopefully we'll build more awesome

2224
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:13,840
stuff and less sucky stuff that's uh

2225
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,840
what we'd like to see

2226
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,400
there any

2227
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,679
any any questions at this point

2228
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,440
otherwise i'm gonna wrap because i am

2229
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,400
six minutes over

2230
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,840
i know

2231
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,120
luckily when i do these things at the

2232
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,120
end of the day most people don't care

2233
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,880
that i go a little bit over but

2234
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,560
alves waiting for slaughter

2235
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,719
my dog cares

2236
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,880
your dog here right

2237
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,800
somewhere else doing doing something

2238
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:42,320
nefarious i'm sure

2239
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,320
you're eating into walkie's time

2240
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,920
sitting there looking at you with the

2241
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:49,360
lead in its mouth

2242
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,600
not quite but anyway yes

2243
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:52,480
um well if anybody does have any any

2244
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,960
questions

2245
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,639
you if you've not seen it already

2246
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,600
because you're here obviously i'm

2247
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,840
running a weird community thing i moved

2248
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,159
away from microsoft teams as a community

2249
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:06,719
because it sucks as a community

2250
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:09,199
and i'm an over into it it's called

2251
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,080
mighty networks and it seems to be

2252
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:12,880
um

2253
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,920
a lot easier to interact with i think is

2254
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,239
probably

2255
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,159
uh the phrase i would use

2256
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,960
um so you're welcome to ask any

2257
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,400
questions there ping me there or on

2258
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:27,360
linkedin or

2259
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:27,360
youtube or wherever you feel like okay

2260
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,679
yes

2261
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,840
i want to

2262
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,520
ask one more question

2263
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,639
i'm curious about the

2264
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,360
no working software or no demo sometimes

2265
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:44,320
the screen may fail

2266
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,360
so what's the diamond what's the dynamic

2267
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,719
in there

2268
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,840
like uh are we still

2269
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:54,080
need to

2270
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:56,000
uh help the event the street if you are

2271
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,840
skip it or

2272
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,639
have a conversation or

2273
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,040
what

2274
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,120
can we gonna do about this

2275
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,560
yeah so if if if you end up in the

2276
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,639
position where

2277
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:11,120
you get to the end of the sprint

2278
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:13,360
and we don't have anything to show

2279
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,320
right i'm obviously not going to show

2280
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:17,679
stuff

2281
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,760
but two weeks has still passed

2282
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,440
right time has still passed still we

2283
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,840
still need to figure out what's the next

2284
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:26,560
most important thing and it might be the

2285
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:30,320
same as the thing we didn't yet deliver

2286
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,040
right but having a conversation about

2287
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:34,960
why why were we unable to

2288
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:37,360
to to deliver is it because the

2289
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,080
requirements weren't clear is it because

2290
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,960
the

2291
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,120
the

2292
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,719
some customer or stakeholder didn't

2293
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,639
provide data that they were meant to

2294
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,080
provide in a timely fashion

2295
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,239
um there could be

2296
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:50,000
a various things that we might want to

2297
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:51,280
deal with within the context of the

2298
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,760
stakeholders

2299
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:55,120
and but we also need to be a little bit

2300
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,639
courageous

2301
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:59,199
as a team

2302
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:00,560
to say you know we tried really hard

2303
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:02,239
this sprint

2304
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,880
and it wasn't good enough

2305
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:06,719
um we weren't able to achieve

2306
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,480
a working version of the product that

2307
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,920
adds more value

2308
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,600
here's why

2309
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,280
here's what we're going to try and do to

2310
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,199
fix it and we're just about to go into

2311
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:16,560
our retrospective to deal with a little

2312
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,400
bit more of that

2313
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,360
um i definitely think it's still worth

2314
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,400
it

2315
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,199
right

2316
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,760
i

2317
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,360
i wouldn't be afraid to say everything

2318
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,719
went wrong

2319
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,560
i would want

2320
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:31,199
the people you're saying everything went

2321
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,360
wrong to to be respectful that we all

2322
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:35,760
did the best we could given our

2323
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,639
knowledge at the time and our skills and

2324
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,480
abilities right and hopefully we learn

2325
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,000
something during the sprint

2326
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,080
what did we learn

2327
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,159
we learned you can't do it that way or

2328
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:48,159
that technology doesn't actually work

2329
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,040
the way it's advertised to work

2330
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,560
or

2331
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,520
uh um

2332
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,280
you know

2333
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,719
uh i don't know peter's not a good

2334
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,520
developer or whatever it was we learned

2335
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,400
uh

2336
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:02,800
during that sprint that resulted in in

2337
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:05,760
our being unsuccessful is a learning

2338
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,760
opportunity as well

2339
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,679
they're much better off hearing that

2340
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,920
news directly from the team in the

2341
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,960
standard time scale and then fine you

2342
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,400
might say it's not going to be a

2343
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,920
two-hour review you might actually

2344
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,679
advertise it out it's been a one-hour

2345
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,440
review and give people back an hour of

2346
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,639
their life now you might find that

2347
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,199
they're actually

2348
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,120
very supportive of you and that's hope

2349
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:27,120
that's the way that it goes and you know

2350
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:29,120
we'll have it's gonna impact us etc so

2351
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:30,800
it might actually be a valuable uh

2352
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,719
experience because the team's actually

2353
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,159
gonna feel the love from the from the

2354
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:37,040
stakeholders so i would i'd always do it

2355
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,760
and

2356
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:42,880
peter i i would if i was a scrum master

2357
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,719
and in that position i i would maybe

2358
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,360
um get in touch with all of the

2359
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:49,440
stakeholders before they arrived and say

2360
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,600
look i don't want you to be surprised by

2361
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:55,040
this we had an incredibly

2362
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:57,840
bad sprint um i i it would be really

2363
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,760
helpful if you could be uh supportive of

2364
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,440
the team and still collaborative in what

2365
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,320
we're going to do next to make things

2366
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,760
better

2367
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:08,480
um i i would maybe maybe

2368
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,560
knowing your stakeholders right

2369
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,800
uh that might be something you want to

2370
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:15,199
do or it might be something you're not

2371
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:18,880
right but do you want but should the

2372
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,880
there's two aspects or two comments

2373
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,719
is appealed with no stakeholders but you

2374
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,320
said the scrum master should contact

2375
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,199
pure the product owner should do that

2376
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,199
for sure yes

2377
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,040
you'll just mention about the retro

2378
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,639
because that's the most important part

2379
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,960
but

2380
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:41,199
should you in that case kind of perhaps

2381
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:43,360
do the retro before just to so that you

2382
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,719
you have some actionable light you said

2383
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,239
okay so this is what we're going to

2384
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,800
change and now we're going into the

2385
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:51,040
retro to figure out what we're going to

2386
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,480
change right

2387
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,080
so so

2388
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,840
yes

2389
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,560
right if the sprint was that much of a

2390
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:01,120
disaster hopefully we found out before

2391
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,639
the last day of the sprint

2392
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,719
and we can start to have those

2393
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,800
conversations with the team because

2394
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:08,960
that's a particular thing that's

2395
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,760
disaster mode

2396
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,880
right the retrospective is on a regular

2397
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,440
cadence

2398
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,520
so that we don't forget to inspect and

2399
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:19,199
adapt on our process

2400
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,120
and but it doesn't mean you can't have a

2401
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:23,120
retrospective at other times because

2402
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:25,520
something happened

2403
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,560
absolutely thank you for that of both of

2404
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,120
those

2405
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,159
uh i meant i meant product owner when i

2406
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:34,719
said scrub

2407
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:35,920
scrub master there um and i also uh

2408
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,600
definitely

2409
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:41,480
don't wait for the retrospective if

2410
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,480
something needs to be dealt with

2411
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,320
ah

2412
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:50,560
somebody just put something in the chat

2413
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:55,120
yeah saying it's okay when you do it in

2414
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,199
the same day yeah it could be and maybe

2415
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,120
you just roll maybe your review in

2416
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,800
retrospective you're including the

2417
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:04,000
stakeholders a little bit in some of

2418
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,840
your retrospective um and you can use

2419
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,480
that time that peter was going to give

2420
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,639
back to to maybe get the stakeholders

2421
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:13,600
involved in how do we solve that problem

2422
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:16,000
um that could be right

2423
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,679
when you're in these circumstances scrum

2424
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,960
is designed to deal with the common

2425
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,440
cause

2426
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,040
when there are exceptions exceptional

2427
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,960
cause um

2428
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,239
deal with it in the best way that you

2429
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,400
think is going to end up with good

2430
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:31,120
results that's what i

2431
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,120
tend to look at

2432
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,239
okay

2433
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,560
well um i

2434
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:41,120
i'm going to have to go on that so

2435
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,080
friendly that i hadn't noticed um the

2436
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:45,280
the

2437
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,440
live stream had no audio

2438
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,040
um so i'm gonna try and do a

2439
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:53,600
post-production

2440
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:55,679
fix on that using the team's audio um

2441
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,719
so well we'll see that's part of the fun

2442
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,600
isn't it

2443
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,280
um

2444
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,840
i had to rebuild i had to reset my

2445
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,840
machine my my laptop does the streaming

2446
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:06,239
and i had to reset my laptop last week

2447
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,880
and i guess something's not right but

2448
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:10,880
it's weird because it when i switch to a

2449
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,520
different uh scene

2450
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,360
it plays the music fine

2451
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,440
it's just not getting the audio from

2452
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,199
teams even though the little bars going

2453
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,840
up so i'll need to figure out how to how

2454
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:21,840
to do that

2455
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,679
i've only had i had another techie in

2456
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:29,840
the house that could help out with that

2457
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:30,880
you need the producer

2458
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,159
well so

2459
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,840
sure

2460
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:38,320
uh and and yeah that's definitely

2461
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,679
something that would be useful

2462
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:43,679
so uh the session in two weeks is uh one

2463
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,360
that i have never done before i'm gonna

2464
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:46,800
have to build it between now and then

2465
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,679
and it's introduction to agile

2466
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,760
leadership um because that seemed to be

2467
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:54,239
what a lot of people were asking for and

2468
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,159
but i think the one after that based on

2469
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:59,920
some of the things that have been asked

2470
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:02,400
here as well as uh on on on the inter

2471
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,600
interwebs it will probably be around

2472
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,440
data

2473
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,120
um how do we measure

2474
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,320
measure the team measure progress

2475
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,880
measure

2476
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,679
so not just the the kanban measures but

2477
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,280
like okrs and

2478
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,120
those kind of things how do we how do we

2479
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:20,639
measure progress and i'll probably go

2480
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,639
into evidence-based management stuff

2481
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:28,159
okay

2482
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:32,159
cool so uh thank you very much for

2483
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:33,360
all of your uh all of your time

2484
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:35,199
and i'm going to go and figure out why

2485
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:38,080
there was no audio

2486
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:38,080
on one scene

2487
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,800
and i hope that was useful

2488
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,320
