1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,120
professional scrum Master immersive

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,280
learning experience is is is unique

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,759
because it

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,360
enables that um double Loop learning

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:16,680
that you get from being able to try

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,039
things in your

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,720
organization and then take take that

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,439
information collaborate with others like

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
like what happened during that

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
collaboration um bring it all together

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,920
with a group of people who are all

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,079
trying to do the same thing and then um

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,879
figure out what you can do differently

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,719
right how do I make this thing that I

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,239
was doing even just a little bit better

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,920
and I and I think there's there's two

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,280
there's a really big advantage in the

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
the PSM because as a public class

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,719
because you've got a bunch of people in

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,840
the class that are from other

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,519
organizations while you you might come

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,399
along and you might bring a friend from

23
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,760
your organization cuz that's always a

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,040
good way to to

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,000
um to get help when you're back in your

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
organization as well right having

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,560
somebody else who's been through the

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,400
same experience uh but also you get um

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:23,520
the different perspectives of the people

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:28,920
in the room um and that is absolutely

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,600
invaluable to enabling you as a scrum

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,960
Master to understand what what what is

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:42,479
realistic and what isn't right a lot of

34
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,119
folks come to um a PSM class especially

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,159
thinking as we're talking about the

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,119
stuff in the class thinking that that

37
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,479
just won't work here right that won't

38
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,640
work in my company it won't work in my

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,399
company because we do this other thing

40
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,439
not realizing and hopefully they do

41
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:02,079
throughout the class but not realizing

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,840
that that scrum is intended to be a

43
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,479
mirror that shows you what what's wrong

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,360
with your organization like why can't

45
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,440
you do that oh we want to do um

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,599
continuous feedback loops right we want

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,200
to at the end of every Sprint we want to

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,160
get some real users in front of the

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,440
software and we want to find out what

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,879
they think about it right we want to

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,239
validate our assumptions well why can't

52
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,120
we do that and I think the immersive

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,040
learning is especially focused on that

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,440
because it's over a much longer period a

55
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,360
time because you have those sections of

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
learning and then that assignment to go

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
and try something in your organization

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,480
and those assignments are kind of

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,959
crafted around those most difficult

60
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,519
ideas um most difficult things to do in

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,080
applications Mo in in applications in in

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,319
your company most

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,840
difficult contentious gnarly problems

64
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,760
that scrum Masters encounter um in their

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,159
organizations so that we can collaborate

66
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,720
and get help from each other right I as

67
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:13,000
the facilitator might have seen a bunch

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,959
of uh um experiences right in in

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,319
organizations where um those things have

70
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,080
worked out perfectly or I might have

71
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,799
seen other ones where things you want to

72
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,680
try um just fell flat right there's no

73
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,360
right answer to any of these questions

74
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,000
so how do we collaborate around it and

75
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,439
how do we maximize that collaboration

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,680
and I think uh the PS M immersive class

77
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,640
maximizes the learning and collaboration

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,040
that happens if you want to have a

79
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,680
discussion about how immersive classes

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,040
can revolutionize your training

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,840
