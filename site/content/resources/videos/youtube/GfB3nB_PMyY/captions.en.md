One of the really powerful things about immersive learning is that because all of the trainers are experienced professionals who've been working in the industry that we're talking about, they bring not just their ability, their knowledge and skills on the theory and the ability to explain the topics, but they also bring a sway of experience of actually having done these things, of engaged with teams, tried things in organisations big and small. So you effectively get consulting as well as training, right? You get facilitated debrief consulting training. You get the whole package with immersive learning.
