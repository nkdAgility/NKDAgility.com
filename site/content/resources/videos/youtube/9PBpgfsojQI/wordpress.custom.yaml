Most organizations don’t invest enough time in this and the organization that does, inevitably wins because their efforts, time, and money are dedicated to a specific purpose.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3,\"dynamicAttributes\":{\"toolsetDSVersion\":\"240000\"}} -->\r\n<h3 id=\"h-training-and-practice\">Training and Practice</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Things don’t improve on their own, they usually descend into chaos. Invest in the right training for your teams, training that helps them develop valuable skills and improves their way of working. From developers through to leadership teams. Invest in agile training and then invest in practice. Getting the ball rolling by doing work that they have been trained in, and being guided through the process by an experienced agile consultant and coach is going to make a significant difference.
