However, there are no direct mentions of workflow definition, explicit workflow policies, entry/exit criteria, WIP limits, or the dynamic/agreement-focused aspects core to the category.

However, it does not discuss Product Developer as a role, accountability, or its formal definitions or behaviors. Most references are generic, and product development is mentioned as an activity, not a specific role. There is some indirect relevance in discussing team responsibilities and quality, but explicit linkage to Product Developer role, skills, or accountability as defined in agile frameworks is lacking.

The material is targeted at practitioners and leaders in agile and product development; however, it does not align with the core requirements of the collective intelligence category.

There is no exploration of agent integration, agent/AI-human synergy, or the governance, feedback, or engineering practices critical for Agentic Software Delivery. The material is entirely focused on traditional agile improvement and coaching, not on algorithmic or agent-driven delivery. The closest relevancy is peripheral: mentions of backlog, feedback, and CI/CD-adjacent agile practices, but these lack any context of agentic software delivery as defined.
