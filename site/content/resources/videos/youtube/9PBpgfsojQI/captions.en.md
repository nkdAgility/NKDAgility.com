2023 is predicted to be a very tough year. What do you think will be needed to win and improve in 2023?

Businesses need to be more astute than they are now. I work with organisation after organisation that have no idea what their cohesive corporate strategy is. They have no idea what level of quality they really want in the products that they create, and they have no idea of what is really needed to understand what it is we need to build. Addressing those things is going to make the difference between being successful in 2023 and being unsuccessful in 2023.

There's quite often a fine line between businesses being profitable and businesses not being profitable, and it can be very small things that make that difference between profitability and not. If you're building products that are delivered in a market where there is lots of choice, then you have to be more attractive than your competitors to your customers.

If you're slow at delivering what customers are asking for, if you don't have all the features that they're looking for in that particular market, if you're losing your skilled employees because they're unhappy and taking their knowledge and skills elsewhere, perhaps to your competitors, then you're not going to be successful.

If the market is hard, right? If everybody's under hardship, those that are going to be successful are the ones that are investing in people and investing in their ways of working. If your ways of working are more effective than your competitors, you'll be successful.

I think that's really what it is. You need to be more effective than your competitors, and Scrum and Kanban are tools that you can use to highlight through data visualisation the current state of what's going on in some of those spaces so that you can look at it and know what you need to improve.

The big things to invest in: product ownership is hugely lacking in organisations. Most organisations have no idea what a product backlog should look like. They have no idea how to analyse the market that their business exists in, and they need people in their organisation that can do that. Those folks aren't going to magically be able to do it; they need training. They need training and they need practice.

That's one of the reasons that we offer an extra hour of coaching, 60 minutes of one-on-one coaching for every student, because I know how difficult it is. You come and take our product owner class, and then three months later you've got all these questions and no way to get answers because your business won't fund a one-hour coaching session with the trainer you had three months ago. So we just include it in the process.

In fact, if people just wanted a chat, I've got a way on my website to book 30 minutes, book a coffee with Martin, and just have a chat about product ownership, about how to get more out of it. It's actually just product management, right? Product management and the product owner is the same thing.

How do you leverage those capabilities that Scrum can enable for your business, or Kanban as well can enable for your business to get better at delivering value? That's going to be the big difference: are we delivering value to our customers?
