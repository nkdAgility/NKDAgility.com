00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,400
foreign

2
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:19,859
2023 is predicted to be a very tough

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,560
year what do you think will be needed to

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,760
win and improve

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,760
in 2023

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,620
businesses need to be more astute

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,380
than they are now I I work with

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,460
organization after organization that

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,940
have

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,300
no idea what their cohesive corporate

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,579
strategy is they have no idea what level

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,680
of quality they really want in the

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,620
products that they create

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,879
um and they have no idea

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,399
of what is really needed in to

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,239
understand what it is we need to we need

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,979
to build and addressing those things

18
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,159
is going to make the difference between

19
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,600
being successful in 2023 and being

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,840
unsuccessful in 2023 the the organizer

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,400
there's quite often a fine line between

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,140
businesses being profitable and

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,720
businesses not being profitable and it

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,000
can be very small things that that make

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,280
that difference between profit

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,159
profitability and not and if you're

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,020
Building Products that are delivered in

28
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,880
a market where there is lots of choice

29
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,060
then you have to be more attractive than

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,840
your competitors to your customers

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,380
um and if you're slow at delivering what

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,020
customers are asking for if you're

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,720
um don't have all the features

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,020
that they're looking for in in that

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,920
particular Market if you're

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,659
um

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,939
losing

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,600
your skilled employees because they're

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,600
unhappy

40
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,659
right and taking their Knowledge and

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,860
Skills elsewhere perhaps to your

42
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,020
competitors

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,080
then you're not going to be successful

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,940
if if the market is hard right if

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,739
everybody's under hardship those that

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,379
are going to be successful are the ones

47
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,920
that are investing in people

48
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,959
and investing in their ways of working

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,760
if your ways of working are more

50
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,500
effective than your competitors you'll

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,340
be successful

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,000
um

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,000
I think that's

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,180
an

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,920
that's that's really what it is you need

56
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,260
you need to be more effective than your

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,819
competitors and

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,900
scrum and kanban are tools that you can

59
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,959
use to highlight through data right

60
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,580
visualization of data the current state

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,920
of what's going on in some of those

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,379
spaces so that you can look at it and

63
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,640
know what what you need to improve

64
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,640
so

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,920
the big things to to invest in product

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,080
ownership is hugely lacking in

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,180
organizations most organizations have

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,720
have no idea what a product backlog

69
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,800
should look like they've it's yeah it's

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,519
just

71
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,980
no idea what it what no idea how to

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,019
analyze their Market that their business

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,340
exists in

74
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,580
um and they need people in their

75
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,200
organization that can do that and those

76
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,239
folks aren't going to magically be able

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,159
to do it they need they need training

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,680
right they need to they need training

79
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,120
and they need practice

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,879
um and that's that's one of the reasons

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,940
that we offer an extra hour of

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,680
coaching right 60 Minutes of one-on-one

83
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,019
coaching for every student because I

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,879
know how so difficult it is you come and

85
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,700
take our product owner product owner

86
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,620
class and then three months later you've

87
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,060
got all these questions and no way to

88
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,120
get answers because your business won't

89
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,560
fund uh uh a one-hour coaching session

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,099
with the trainer you had three months

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,080
ago so we just include it in the process

92
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:07,200
and and and in fact if

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,819
man if people just wanted a chat I've

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,680
Got Away on my website to book 30

95
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,439
minutes book a coffee with Martin right

96
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,560
and just have a chat about product

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,479
ownership about how to get more out of

98
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,400
it how it's actually just product

99
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,320
management Right add your product

100
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,759
management and the product owner is the

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,560
same thing

102
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
um and how do you leverage those

103
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,360
capabilities that that scrum can enable

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,520
for your business or kanban as well can

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,900

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,060
um I

107
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,680
to get better

108
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,300
at delivering value

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,919
that's going to be the big difference

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,919
are we delivering value to our customers
