# 2023 is predicted to be a very tough year. What do you think will be needed to win and improve?

#agile has a great reputation and track record for helping #agileleaders respond quickly to change and adapt what they are doing to continuously create and deliver value to customers.

Sound too good to be true? 

It can be. #scrum and #agile are notorious for being relatively simple to grasp but incredibly difficult to master, and so not every #agile adoption ends in a fairy tale. It requires rigor, discipline, and commitment to succeed and it requires #leaders to actively champion #agile for it to flourish.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the things that will be super important for organizations to consider and master if they are going to thrive through the turbulence and complexity of the next 18 months.
