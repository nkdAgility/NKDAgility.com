1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,200
naked agility can be your partner in

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,759
creating engineering excellence and

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,000
Technical leadership within your

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,240
organization in the last few videos

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,480
we've talked about a number of

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,199
different ways or things that we focus

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,439
on that are part of part of that story

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,560
we talked about that that high cost of

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,920
of of bad quality of mediocre product

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,519
right not even mediocre poor quality

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,640
product there's lots of poor quality

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,360
products out there that have a massive

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,680
cost particularly in your brand

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,680
recognition right people don't want to

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,800
use products that they have a envisage

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,520
in their head to be of poor quality we

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,800
talked a lot about shifting left and the

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,239
different components that we would shift

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,359
left not just uh testing and test

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,239
automation but continuous integration

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,199
continuous delivery we talked about user

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,519
experience shifting left we talked about

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,000
security shifting left architecture

24
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,320
shifting left all of these things need

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
to move as close to the engineering team

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,439
that's making the decisions the people

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,759
that are making the decisions and doing

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,960
the work all of those things those

29
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,119
skills those capabilities those not need

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,320
to be built up in those teams in order

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:25,400
for you move to move towards this idea

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,320
of engineering Excellence right we we we

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,479
need to not manage technical debt but

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,680
pay it back deal with it deal with the

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,680
technical debt when it happens own up to

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,280
it when we make a mistake be transparent

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,920
and open about what the problem was and

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,360
what we're going to do it and build that

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,280
culture of quality build that culture of

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,119
engineering Excellence within our

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,560
organization your purpose is creating
