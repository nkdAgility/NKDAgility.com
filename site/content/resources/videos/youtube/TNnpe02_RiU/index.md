**What is Your Peeve in DevOps**

**Debunking DevOps Peeves**

DevOps has its fair share of grumbles and groans, which have beocme pet peeves. These peeves, more often than not, are due to misunderstanding or resistance to change.

In the spirit of continuous improvement and with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor, let's clear the air and tackle these head-on!

**Embrace Continuous Delivery**

"What's your biggest pet peeve in DevOps?" Here's mine: The persistent myth that continuous delivery is unattainable, that we can't empower developers to ship products into production.

It's a fallacy I've debunked time and again during my 20+ years as a Lean-Agile & DevOps Consultant. 💼

This lingering notion that achieving continuous delivery is unachievable, or that we can't trust developers with the "big, scary" task of pushing products into production. This baseless belief, I must say, has been knocked down countless times in my experience. 🚀👨‍💼

Let's clear the air around pet peeves in DevOps:

**Empowerment**:  Developers can and should oversee continuous delivery. Equip them with the right tools and mindset. 💪

**Continuous Delivery**: It's not just a dream. It's a reality I've seen teams achieve, accelerating workflow and delivery. 🚀

**Myth Debunked**: This misconception is an innovation roadblock. Let's dismantle it. 🚧

Therefore, continuous delivery is within your reach, and developers can lead the charge. Don't let peeves hold you back. 🎯
