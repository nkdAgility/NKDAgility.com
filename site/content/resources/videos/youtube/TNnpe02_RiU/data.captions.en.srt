1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,900
so I think my pet peeve about devops is

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,580
this the the the fallacy that people

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,640
cling to that they can't do that here

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,920
that the the the that they can't do

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,320
continuous delivery that they can't ship

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,380
their product into production that they

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,039
can't give developers that power to be

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,039
able to do that and it's just not true
