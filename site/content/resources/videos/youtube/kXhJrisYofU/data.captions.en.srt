1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,959
in

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,600
traditional

3
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:10,719
budgeting we take all we we spend a

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,320
bunch of time once per year and have

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,320
been a little bit factious but have a

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,359
whole bunch of people in our

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,240
organization fight over how much money

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,080
is going to be allocated to their

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,800
pot right and then that's that's their

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,640
pot for the

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,000
year they

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,320
know that if they don't spend it they

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,920
lose it right if you allocate a million

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,040
dollar to to a particular project and

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,040
they only use

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,840
500,000 next year you're going to be

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,200
thinking of giving them 500,000 and it's

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
going to be very hard for them to fight

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,280
for for for for a million even if that's

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,120
just the normal EB and flow of what it

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,320
is we're working

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:53,039
on and if something doesn't fit within

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,239
like we spend we spend such a long time

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,719
building the budget and balancing it

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,440
right like a like a like one I've seen

26
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,080
those the the the the budget that

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,759
countries have it's this massive massive

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,040
massive book we end up with not not

29
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,680
obviously as big as that because we

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,759
don't have as many things but a big book

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,000
of here's what the the budget is for the

32
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,240
year the problem

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,400
is that five minutes after we've

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,000
ratified the budget that we put our

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,920
stamp on it and said yep that's our

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,320
budget for the year the market

37
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,280
changes the the the state of the product

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,079
changes ideas change so if somebody

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,079
comes up with an

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,320
idea it's not in the budget for this

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,360
year right but the market opportunity is

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,600
in a couple of weeks we have enough time

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
to build it but we don't have any budget

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,880
right that's maybe small enough that we

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
can there's discretionary funding but

46
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,200
let's say it was 6 months worth of work

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,000
so it's massive effort massive Endeavor

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,640
but huge huge huge payoffs

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,719
then we'd probably do something right

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,239
but where's that balance in your

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,879
organization that that level that the

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,680
scale of the payoff versus the cost we

53
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,599
have the money we have to go

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,879
find where's that where's that biting

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,160
point and how much do we lose how much

56
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:26,920
value in the market do we lose because

57
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,720
lots of things just don't quite hit that

58
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,160
biting point because we're doing yearly

59
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,720
budgets so there's a bunch of things

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,680
around Beyond budgeting which is how do

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,879
we re How We Do budgets in order to be

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,800
more effective but effectively the

63
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,120
result that you want for your

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,680
organization is that you can fund the

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,879
things that make sense at the time they

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,879
make sense right so in the agile World

67
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,400
we're getting working product in front

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,840
of our customers as frequently as we can

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,640
right so depending on what it is you're

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,239
building that that time scale might

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:10,480
change I the manifesto says for from a

72
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,840
few weeks to a few months right scrum

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,159
talks about 30 days 30 days is the

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,159
maximum amount of time between uh uh um

75
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,400
getting things in front of your

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,080
customers and if you look at the the

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:28,720
detecting agile BS paper from the US

78
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,760
Department of Defense uh they talk about

79
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,799
every iteration in including the first

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,280
getting your product in front of real

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,959
customers so not not not to uat not to

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,200
just merely test users but to real

83
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
production users so you're going to

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,000
production every every iteration if

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
you're doing that if you're getting to

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,959
production every iteration then that's

87
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,400
your pivot point right it's not a yearly

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,040
Pivot Point figuring out what we're

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,239
going to do but it's a a a a much

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,159
smaller pivot point so instead of

91
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:01,599
allocating all the money at a single

92
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,920
yearly point we want to be EB and

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,120
flowing as you know this this project

94
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,799
reach reaches a dead end there's not

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,079
much more value to be had so we're not

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
going to we're not going to continue it

97
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,120
we're not going to do more Sprints we're

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
not going to do more iterations at the

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,479
moment we're going to move it into

100
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,400
maintenance mode which changes its cost

101
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,919
profile and for other things there's a

102
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,800
new initiative some folks have come up

103
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,600
with a great idea let's let's let's fund

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,479
that so you're effectively looking at

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,479
more of a of a venture capitalist or a

106
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,080
entrepreneur style budgeting model in

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,240
that you're not allocating all the

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,199
funding to projects upfront you're

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,360
allocating you have a pool of of of

110
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,680
Finance available like how much can we

111
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,320
spend you should know that on a regular

112
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,919
basis what's our what's our capability

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,160
and then we want to spend as little as

114
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,120
possible to get the maximum value and

115
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,600
that EB and flow needs to happen the

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,479
difficulty

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,680
in the traditional model is I I have a

118
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,840
had a customer

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,560
recently who are doing big things it's

120
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,400
manufacturing and they're making big

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,160
things big expensive things and they had

122
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,759
a a machine that was

123
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,840
faulty and the well okay it wasn't

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,759
faulty it was just getting old it was

125
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,240
starting to make mistakes it it it it

126
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,440
was creating less effective Parts than

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,800
the product

128
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
needed and they kept using it and the

129
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,120
person who ran the machine wrote the

130
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,039
business case for H getting a new

131
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,280
machine and started passing it up the

132
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,759
chain they did all the due diligence

133
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,280
they needed to do and it kept going up

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,840
in the organization because I think it

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,440
was a 10 it was a 10 or2 million spend

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,520
therefore it had to go Fairly high in

137
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,919
the organization to get approval and it

138
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,160
got to somebody who looked at it and

139
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,960
said that's not on my budget for this

140
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,000
year no and that that's not in its

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,960
budget for this year no cost the company

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,919
billions of dollars in recall calls to

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,000
recall the product and and and and

144
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,680
resolve the issues that that resulted

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,039
from this machine that could have been

146
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,160
replaced for $10 million and it cost

147
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,080
billions so that that's why we need to

148
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,280
that that's an example of why we need to

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,599
do something different the bit that you

150
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,479
don't see like that's an obvious one

151
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,400
right that's a catalyst for change

152
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,360
because oh my goodness me we just we

153
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,520
just had this huge cost why did we have

154
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,639
it because of this $10 million we didn't

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,039
spend well let's spend the 10

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,400
million but the bit you don't see is

157
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,680
your unrealized value if you think of in

158
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,240
evidence-based management at the top of

159
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,039
the curve in your in your market value

160
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,479
of your product you've

161
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,840
got unrealized value on one side and

162
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,400
value on the other so you've got value

163
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,520
that's in your product your your your

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,800
current increment and then you've got

165
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,280
unrealized value which should be

166
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,680
reflected in your backlog but there's

167
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
more unrealized value than is actually

168
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,599
in your backlog

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,599
right we want to be continually adapting

170
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:12,160
that unrealized value as the market

171
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:16,479
shifts as opportunities arise as things

172
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,840
change in the world and it's very

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,680
difficult to do that within the bounds

174
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,840
of a traditional yearly budget cycle so

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,240
we need to adapt our yearly budget cycle

176
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,560
into the context of we're not doing

177
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,039
yearly projects anymore we're building

178
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,639
products and a product has a budget and

179
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,440
they can allocate it however they like

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,319
and budgets for products tend to look

181
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,080
like n number of people right the most

182
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,599
usually usually the most expensive thing

183
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,560
especially when we're building software

184
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,080
is the people so this particular product

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,159
has the budget to support 100

186
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,960
people a year on it that's that's their

187
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,879
budget cycle and then with within that

188
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,599
budget cycle they're deciding how they

189
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:05,919
allocate it what features they allocate

190
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,400
to within that context that can be a

191
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,400

192
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,840
might still be doing yearly budgets and

193
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,960
but you're able to adapt it to the

194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,479
product cycle but there's more you can

195
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,479
do take a look at Beyond budget
