    "final_score": 7.0,
    "reasoning": "The content does not mention OKRs at all, nor does it discuss their theoretical underpinnings, implementation, or strategic role. Its entire focus is on general consulting mindsets, contrasting dogmatic versus empirical approaches with an emphasis on empathy, adaptation, and learning. While continuous learning and empirical adaptation are relevant principles to modern frameworks (including those that could employ OKRs), there are no direct or indirect references to objectives, measurable key results, strategic alignment, or any framework-specific practices associated with OKRs. The content is geared at consultants and generally at those interested in agile/Scrum, but this is ambient rather than specific to OKRs. The overall lack of conceptual and practical alignment, combined with the absence of even cursory mention, results in a very low confidence score.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content discusses the value of empirical, adaptive consulting and continuous learning, but does not reference or align with Objective Key Results or their principles. There is no mention of OKRs, measurement, alignment, or outcome-based frameworks. Alignment with the OKR category is minimal.",

    "reasoning": "The content addresses the drawbacks of dogma in consulting and advocates for empirical, adaptive, and people-centric approaches. It aligns with Agentic Engineering in emphasizing continuous learning, adaptability, and empiricism, but does not clearly discuss developer or system agency, DevOps, AI collaborations, or decision decentralisation. No direct mention of Agentic Engineering concepts or terminology. Some tangential relevance for practitioners, but not a focused or thorough discussion of agentic engineering principles.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content partially aligns with Agentic Engineering through its focus on empiricism, adaptability, and continuous learning, relevant to practitioners. However, it lacks explicit reference to agency, technical practices, or the deliberate design of engineering for agency, resulting in moderate confidence for this category.",

There is no mention of autonomous AI agents, agentic systems, or related practices. The themes align more generally with Agile philosophy, not Agentic Software Delivery. There is no discussion of AI integration, modern engineering, feedback loops with agents, or synergy between human and AI expertise. As such, there is very low conceptual alignment, depth, and almost no direct mentions or explicit relevance to Agentic Software Delivery.",
