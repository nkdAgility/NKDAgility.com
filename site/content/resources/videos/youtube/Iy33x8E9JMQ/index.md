short_title: Dogma vs Empiricism in Consulting
description: Explores why rigid dogma hinders consulting, emphasising the value of empirical, flexible, and empathetic approaches for effective problem-solving and continuous learning.
tldr: Rigid adherence to fixed methods limits innovation and effectiveness in consulting; instead, teams should move from strict training routines to flexible, evidence-based approaches that adapt to changing needs. Building relationships through empathy and mutual respect is key, and embracing continuous learning and empirical adaptation leads to better outcomes. Development managers should encourage adaptability and ongoing learning to stay responsive and successful.

## The Thin Line: Dogma vs Empiricism in Consulting Engagements

In my journey, I've come to firmly grasp the undeniable truth that dogma holds no ground, especially when it comes to consulting engagements.

Here, I delve deeper into why I assert that dogma really has no place in a consulting engagement. Indeed, it actually has no place anywhere!

## Zero Room for Dogma

I genuinely believe that dogma really has no place in a consulting engagement.¬† üö´

Indeed, it actually has no place anywhere!

These strong words echo my firm belief that consulting should be a realm free of rigid, unyielding doctrines. It should be a space that encourages fresh perspectives and innovative approaches.

Dogma restricts us, hindering the flow of fresh and innovative ideas. It's essential to realise that what worked yesterday might not be the best solution for tomorrow.

## Pedantic Approaches in Training - A Necessary Evil?

While it's true that there is a place for being pedantic, especially during training phases because you're trying to learn something - understand the nitty-gritty of processes and systems - it should not be a permanent stance.

There is a place for being pedantic while training because you're trying to learn something.

Learning is about grasping 'Here's the way this thing is supposed to be', but being open to adaptations and improvements is equally important.¬† üìò

The key is to transition from this phase to a more fluid approach as you step into the real world of implementation.

## Engaging with Empathy and Flexibility

Here comes the pivotal point - when you are actively engaging with individuals in an organisation, understanding their roles and aiding them in performing their jobs more efficiently, there's absolutely no room for a pedantic approach.

Instead, we should focus on fostering relationships based on understanding and building mutual respect.¬† ü§ù

## Empirical Adaptation

It's all about pragmatically and empirically adapting our processes to the changing business demands. ¬†üí°

Embracing Empiricism means we're flexible, responsive, and adaptive, ready to mould our strategies per the evolving business landscape.
