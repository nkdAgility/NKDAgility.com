1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,899
I think that that Dogma really has no no

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:09,360
place in a Consulting engagement

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,099
um it actually has no no place anywhere

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,599
right Dogma has no place anymore

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,260
anywhere

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,880
um but there there is a place for being

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,560
pedantic

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,300
um when you're in training right because

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,460
you're trying to learn something here's

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,140
the way this thing is supposed to be but

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,880
when you're actually implementing inside

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,039
of organizations when you're actually

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,019
talking about talking to people and

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,079
engaging with them when they're trying

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,880
to do their jobs there's no place for

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,880
pedanticism

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,260
even a word either it's about being

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,899
pragmatic and empirically adapting our

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,860
processes to the changing demands of the

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,860
business that's it
