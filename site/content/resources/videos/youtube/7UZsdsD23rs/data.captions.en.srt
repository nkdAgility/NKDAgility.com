1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:10,440
what is empiricism and why is it so

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,880
critical

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,760
yeah I think I think in in empiricism

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,359
so what is empiricism that is a great

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,760
question so empiricism is

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,039
um effectively inspecting and adapting

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,099
we hear that we hear that a lot in in

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,099
the agile space and empiricism is we we

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,899
need to something happens

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,360
we need to be able to see what happened

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,460
right we we we will look at the data

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,079
that's the transparency piece right we

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,239
can see what's going on really what's

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
going on not vanity metrics not all of

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,600
that [Â __Â ] right we can actually see

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,399
what's going on

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,020
and then we're going to we're actually

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,600
going to look at it so it's not good

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,460
enough just to have the transparency you

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,780
have to go look right you have to go and

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,100
analyze the data you know all those

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,379
reports that you create that you know

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,899
nobody ever looks at they're all crap

24
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,059
right you want to be actually what data

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,000
do you need in order to make different

26
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,260
decisions so we have the data the

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,260
transparency right or or what's going on

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,780
look at it and then we change the way we

29
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,340
do things we change something right and

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,040
that could be

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,840
um lots of different inspect and adapt

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,259
Loops there's a bunch of inspecting

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,060
adapt Loops for example baked into scrum

34
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,280
that's why they call it an empirical

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,460
process right it's implementing a number

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,420
of different uh inspect and adapt Loops

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,259
at one of those Loops is the the daily

38
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,060
right you've got a Sprint backlog your

39
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,579
Sprint backlog represents your

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,060
transparency of the present what's going

41
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,600
on just now and then every day you're

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,840
adapting inspecting and adapting

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,720
that backlog continually adapting that

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,880
plan towards completion of the Sprints

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,420
um you've also got the Sprint review

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,780
right continually adapting the product

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,580
backlog and the product goal towards

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,319
whatever Direction you're going that way

49
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,080
you're able to kind of steer in

50
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,819
different directions as you close those

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,160
feedback loops

52
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,620
and then you get the Retro which is the

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,540
feedback loop for the process itself our

54
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,900
working agreement right our definition

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,099
of workflow and every at the end of

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,739
every Sprint we're going to get together

57
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,440
and figure out what happened during the

58
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,000
Sprint and how can we change this to

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,400
make our lives in the next Sprint a

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
little bit better or my Our Lives five

61
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,099
Sprints down the line a little bit

62
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,340
better

63
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:45,840
so there's three inspect and adapt Loops

64
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:49,620
just in that part of the process and the

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,120
entire Sprint is another inspect and

66
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,580
adapt Loop your customer right the the

67
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,280
stakeholders are engaging in that

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,800
inspect and adapt process at the end of

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,080
every single Sprint they can see what

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,120
you've done and can decide whether they

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,780
want to invest in another Sprint right

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,440
do I am I getting enough value or is

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,239
there enough potential value that it's

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,860
worth me spending money for another

75
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,200
Sprint or are we done

76
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,120
right perhaps it was a bad idea right

77
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,980
we're quite early in the process and we

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,040
we had a cool idea but it doesn't turn

79
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,879
out it's it's it's very good or perhaps

80
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,920
uh um we're going in slightly the wrong

81
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,580
direction and they need to Twitch it

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,379
over somewhere else pivot right uh at

83
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,720
the end of the the Sprint and figure out

84
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,879
where we're going next

85
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,040
that's the real power of inspect and

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,459
adapt and that's why

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,680
um organizations that have

88
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,599
large hierarchies and the people that

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
are making decisions are too far away

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,000
from this actual work that's going on

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,920
and aren't able to respond quickly

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,739
enough to the market right because

93
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,959
either your mark your Market is either a

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,480
commercial market right your business is

95
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,700
doing business with other people or

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,680
potentially for a product your Market is

97
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,140
inside of the organization right it's

98
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,320
another part of the business that is

99
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,900
delivering something and as their needs

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
change or the market needs change you

101
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,680
need to continually adapt the features

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,080
that you're creating the direction that

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,639
you're going what you're supporting in

104
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,759
order to best meet those needs because

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,520
they're serving some some other Market

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,620
as well that's constantly changing so

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,540
that's why we need those

108
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,540
feedback Clips that's why we need

109
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,880
empiricism because we actually don't

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,860
know where we're going we might know

111
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,620
what we want to what we think up front

112
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,660
we want to create for this product

113
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,639
right but

114
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,240
what about who we're providing that

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,120
product for is their capability business

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,639
Direction stagnant or is it constantly

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,419
changing what about what they're those

118
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,520
people are creating their outputs for is

119
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,259
that stagnant or constantly changing and

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,740
how quickly can we close those feedback

121
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,320
loops that's really what agile is all

122
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,820
