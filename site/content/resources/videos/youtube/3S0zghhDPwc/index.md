When we talk about Agile practices, we often highlight flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. However, one key Agile virtue that is often overlooked is _diligence_. Diligence, in its essence, is that unwavering attention to detail and the commitment to doing what needs to be doneâ€”no shortcuts, no compromises. Itâ€™s about ensuring quality at every step of the process, and in the world of Agile, this is where the definition of "done" becomes crucial.

## **What is Diligence in Agile?**

In Agile teams, diligence is the commitment to following through on processes, maintaining quality, and adhering to standards. Itâ€™s easy to write down a "Definition of Done" and tuck it away on the team wiki, but true diligence means ensuring that every team member understands it, follows it, and holds themselves accountable to it.

- **Definition of Done**: This is your compliance bar, your minimum standard for what qualifies as a completed piece of work.

- **Following Through**: It's not enough to have a checklistâ€”diligence demands that you follow it rigorously.

- **Team Accountability**: Everyone on the team must understand the definition of done and have the grit to see it through.

When you operate with diligence, you're not just checking off boxes. You're actively contributing to the quality and reliability of your product. This virtue isn't optionalâ€”itâ€™s a must-have for teams that aim for long-term success.

## **Why is Diligence Overlooked?**

From a leadership perspective, itâ€™s easy to assume that quality is a given. Many businesses expect that once a process is defined, the team will follow it. But in reality, this is not always the case.

Organizations might think:

- "Our team knows what they're doing."

- "Quality should be automatic by now."

- "We donâ€™t need to focus on definitionsâ€”we need speed."

Yet, without diligence, quality quickly becomes inconsistent, standards are forgotten, and processes are bypassed in the name of speed. The assumption that quality is a "default" is where many Agile teams go wrong.

## **How to Cultivate Diligence in Your Team**

To foster diligence within your Agile team, there are a few key areas to focus on:

### **1\. Create and Follow a Strong Definition of Done**

Your definition of done isnâ€™t just a guideline; itâ€™s the foundation for the quality of your work. Ensure it is:

- **Clearly Defined**: Everyone knows what constitutes "done."

- **Visible**: Keep it front and center, not buried in a wiki.

- **Agreed Upon**: The team must buy into it.

Without a strong definition of done, diligence will fade, and quality will be inconsistent.

### **2\. Increase Focus on Quality Over Speed**

In fast-paced environments, speed often takes precedence over quality. But diligent teams know that consistent quality leads to faster delivery in the long run. Hereâ€™s how to increase focus on quality:

- **Hold Regular Quality Reviews**: Review work not just for completeness, but for adherence to standards.

- **Promote Peer Accountability**: Encourage team members to hold each other accountable for the definition of done.

- **Expand Your Definition of Done**: As your team grows in maturity, so too should your quality standards.

### **3\. Encourage Grit and Perseverance**

Agile isn't just about flexibility; itâ€™s about gritâ€”the ability to keep pushing through challenges and maintaining focus, even when the going gets tough. Teams that exhibit diligence are often:

- **Resilient**: They donâ€™t give up when the pressure mounts.

- **Committed to Improvement**: They consistently look for ways to improve the quality of their work.

- **Focused**: They prioritize doing things the right way, not just the fast way.

## **Personal Example: How Diligence Made All the Difference**

In my early days working with Agile teams, I noticed a recurring issue: we would often rush to complete a sprint without fully adhering to our definition of done. It felt like we were moving fast, but in reality, we were constantly backtracking to fix issues that should have been caught earlier.

One project in particular stands out. The team was building a new feature for a client, and we rushed it to completion. On the surface, everything seemed fineâ€”we met the deadline, and the feature was live. But soon after, we started receiving feedback about bugs, missing functionality, and overall poor user experience.

Why? Because we had cut corners on our definition of done. We didnâ€™t follow our checklist, we didnâ€™t test thoroughly, and ultimately, we paid the price.

After that, I made it a point to instill a culture of diligence in every team I worked with. We redefined our definition of done, made it a non-negotiable, and held each other accountable to follow through on it. The difference was night and day. Not only did we see a marked improvement in product quality, but our velocity also increased as we spent less time fixing issues and more time delivering value.

## **Lessons Learned**

- **Diligence isnâ€™t optional**: Itâ€™s essential for long-term success.

- **Quality leads to speed**: When you focus on doing things right the first time, you end up delivering faster.

- **Accountability is key**: Without team-wide accountability, diligence falls apart.

## **Conclusion: Make Diligence Your Competitive Advantage**

If your team is struggling to consistently deliver high-quality work, itâ€™s time to take a hard look at your definition of done and how well youâ€™re following it. Diligence is not just a nice-to-haveâ€”itâ€™s the key to unlocking true Agile success.

Hereâ€™s how you can start cultivating diligence in your team:

- **Refine your Definition of Done**: Make it clear, visible, and non-negotiable.

- **Hold Each Other Accountable**: Encourage grit and perseverance in following through on standards.

- **Prioritize Quality**: Donâ€™t sacrifice long-term success for short-term speed.
