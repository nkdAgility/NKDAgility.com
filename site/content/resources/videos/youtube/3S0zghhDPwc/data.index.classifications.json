    "reasoning": "There are no direct references to Service Level Expectation (SLE) or any SLE-related terminology in the content. The main ideas focus on diligence, definition of done, quality, and team accountability within Agile, with in-depth discussion and examples exclusively around these topics. There is no mention of cycle time, lead time, probabilistic forecasting, or time-based predictability, nor are SLE's definitions, calculations, or applications discussed. The content’s purpose (cultivating diligence and quality) targets Agile practitioners, which partly overlaps with the SLE audience but remains off-category. Most of the content's narrative is dedicated to general Agile virtues and practical, process-oriented advice that does not align with the SLE definition provided. Thus, the overall confidence is extremely low for this being a valid SLE classification.",
