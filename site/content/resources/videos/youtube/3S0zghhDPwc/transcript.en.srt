of focus that enables those things to

7
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,039

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,000
lip service to this uh uh level of

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:46,199
quality your your your definition of

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,399
done is your compliance bar for what

17
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,680
needs to happen in order for your

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
product to be able to ship and that is

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,160
the diligence that your organization

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,359
expects the reason organizations and

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,440
businesses don't really talk about

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,480
definition of done from a leadership

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,799
perspective is because it's just

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,439
expected that we'll have a level of

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,880
quality that they're able to use that's

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,960
just just the

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,400
default but unfortunately it's not the

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,640
default in many

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:22,640
