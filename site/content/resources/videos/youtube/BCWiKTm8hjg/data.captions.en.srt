1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,720
one of the key agile virtues

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,440
is one of the key agile virtues is

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,880
charity and that that

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:22,199
manifests in in in our world as things

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,680
like be being willing to help each other

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,320
for no specific gain right I want to I

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
want to help my colleagues on the team

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,079
because it helps us all not because I

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,520
get something out of it I want to be

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,480
looking at um making sure that my team

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,920
is successful that my product is

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,239
successful that my company is successful

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,800
and I'm not necessarily doing it because

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,559
I get my bonus I'm I'm I'm doing it

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,879
because it helps the people around me

16
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,519
that we're all better because of it and

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,760
that we're able to create the best uh

18
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,519
possible products for our customers that

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,799
that leads back to Dan Pink's autonomy

20
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,240
Mastery and purpose right I want to feel

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,560
like the work that I do

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:19,799
matters and charity is part of that

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:23,439
right uh for example I'm a Microsoft MVP

24
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,759
I don't get that mvp for paid work I get

25
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,560
that mvp for spending time in the

26
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,079
community providing help and support to

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,759
other for free and I do that both in the

28
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:39,439
technical space and in the agile space

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,320

things that are happening in your

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,759
organization and if in half an hour I

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,520

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,119

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,520
in success right I I don't I don't do do

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,399
that for direct renumeration I do that

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
because I like helping people I like

40
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,640
