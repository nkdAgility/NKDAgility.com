As I sit here reflecting on my journey as a professional Scrum trainer and consultant, I can't help but think about the profound changes we've all experienced in recent times. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to adapt, and while I miss travelling the globe for training sessions, I've found new ways to connect and share knowledge online. Today, I want to dive into some pressing questions that have come up during my recent sessions, particularly around the roles within Scrum and how they impact organisations.

### The Distinction Between Product Owners and Project Managers

One of the most common questions I encounter is the difference between a Product Owner (PO) and a Project Manager (PM). At first glance, these roles may seem similar, but they serve distinct purposes within a Scrum framework.

- **Product Owner**: The PO is accountable for value delivery. This means they must understand the product backlog, prioritise work based on market needs, and ensure that the team is delivering value to the organisation. They are deeply involved in the product's vision and strategy, focusing on what features users need and how the product will be used in production.

- **Project Manager**: In contrast, the PM traditionally focuses on delivering projects on time, within budget, and according to specified features. Their success is often measured by the completion of tasks rather than the value delivered. While some PMs may also take on PO responsibilities, the core focus remains on managing the project rather than the product.

This distinction is crucial, especially as organisations transition from traditional project management to more agile practices. The role of the PO is essential in an empirical process control system, where adaptability and responsiveness to change are paramount.

### The Broader Impact of Scrum on Organisations

Another question that frequently arises is: apart from the Scrum team, who else in the organisation does Scrum affect? The answer is quite comprehensive. 

- **Organisational Structure**: Scrum encourages a shift from traditional hierarchies to more autonomous, cross-functional teams. This change requires a rethinking of how teams are structured and how they interact with one another. 

- **Leadership vs Management**: As organisations adopt Scrum, the focus shifts from management to leadership. Leaders set the direction and remove obstacles, allowing teams to self-organise and deliver value more effectively. This transition can significantly alter budgeting, project planning, and team dynamics.

- **Value Streams**: Instead of thinking in terms of fixed projects, organisations begin to view their work as a flow of value. This perspective allows for greater flexibility in resource allocation and prioritisation based on market demands and organisational goals.

### Evolving Beyond Story Points

Finally, I want to address a question that often comes up in discussions about Scrum practices: Should teams still be using story points after several sprints? My answer is a resounding noâ€”if you're on sprint 22 and still relying on story points, it may be time to reassess your approach.

- **Initial Learning Tool**: Story points can be a useful tool for teams just starting with Scrum, helping them to estimate and plan their work. However, as teams mature, they should shift their focus towards flow metrics and Kanban principles.

- **Optimising Delivery**: Instead of measuring success by story points, teams should aim to optimise their flow of work. This means monitoring how quickly items move through the system and focusing on delivering value continuously, rather than just at the end of a sprint.

- **Continuous Improvement**: The goal should be to create a fully automated deployment pipeline, allowing for frequent releases and rapid feedback. This approach not only enhances the team's agility but also aligns with the principles of Lean and DevOps.

### Conclusion

As we navigate these challenging times, it's essential to remember that agility is not just about adopting new practices; it's about fostering a mindset that embraces change and values collaboration. Whether you're a Product Owner, Project Manager, or part of a Scrum team, understanding these distinctions and their implications can lead to more effective and responsive organisations.

If you're interested in further exploring these concepts, I invite you to join my upcoming Professional Agile Leadership class. Together, we can delve deeper into how to implement these practices effectively within your organisation.
