00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,940
hey this is Martin Intuit I'm a

5
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,989
professional scrum trainer with scrum

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:46,719
dark and I Microsoft MVP I own my own

7
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,629
consulting company in Scotland and I

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,899
travel around the world doing consulting

9
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:54,940
and training but at the moment obviously

10
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,920
not traveling around the world if you're

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,640
watching this video at another time we

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:04,649
are all on lockdown at the moment or

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,800
covered 19 so I have taken two and

14
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:12,399
helping some folks out over over the

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,630
internet getting some questions coming

16
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:21,039
in and then just getting online and

17
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,850
answering them my good friend Debbie who

18
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:31,390
we often disagree about things was

19
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:34,119
online earlier and I stole the idea for

20
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,729
office hours kind of from her but it's

21
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,190
something that that I had in mind anyway

22
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:44,580
but I definitely have to give her some

23
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:49,569
props for that so ultimately this is a

24
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:52,720
ask me anything session I have a few

25
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:57,129
questions that I have collected since

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,340
last week I'm interested in any

27
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:05,379
questions you have you can ask questions

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,929
in the chat which I have and I can see

29
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:14,620
all of the the chats that might be

30
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:18,910
available but also I have a way for you

31
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:22,440
to ask questions if you are not happy

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:26,650
about being publicly acknowledged as

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,920
having asked that question so on the

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,709
side of the screen here there there is a

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,730
link to a forum where you can

36
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:39,700
anonymously ask a question in a box and

37
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,360
I will read out those questions and then

38
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,530
do my best to answer them

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,690
[Music]

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:52,360
so there's a couple of things that I did

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,440
want to mention first I noticed on the

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,510
Scrambler Dawg website there was a

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,800
couple of things that I thought were

44
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:05,860
were super awesome and I really enjoyed

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:09,849
the first was an article by Simon one of

46
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:13,470
our trainers from Canada about learning

47
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:16,150
scrum using minecraft education edition

48
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,459
so I think this is this was a really

49
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,230
good article I would recommend you read

50
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:23,860
it and maybe take a look at minecraft

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,950
education to help facilitate some some

52
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,329
things that you might want to do the

53
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,599
second one is from Christian probably

54
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:38,140
needs no introduction from his

55
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,760
Mythbusters series and he's talking

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,450
about

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,420
the myth that you can't do projects with

58
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,850
scrum which is indeed a myth there's

59
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,370
nothing in scrum that says you can't do

60
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,810
projects or focus on projects or do

61
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,030
anything of the kind it you can do

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,579
whatever you want so that's a good

63
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,609
article in CS get quite a few at

64
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,100
comments and it really tackles some of

65
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:06,549
the and I think Christians been very

66
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,950
good at tackling some of the the I don't

67
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:13,329
know what you would call it the

68
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:16,479
evangelical side of scrum Evangelic or

69
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:18,370
maybe the the the I guess I would say

70
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
bible-bashing but it's maybe not

71
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,970
politically correct at site of scrum

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,880
where people are saying you can't you

73
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,740
can't do things or scrum is this way or

74
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:32,710
scrum is that way I think there's

75
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:36,360
there's a place for focusing on the

76
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,200
rules of scrum which is in training um

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,970
and then there's a place for focusing on

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,300
the value that you're trying to get

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,700
which is in the real world so training

80
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,640
is not the real world it's a safe to

81
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,289
fail small space once you get out into

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,300
the real world you're going to have to

83
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,440
make compromises and that's just just

84
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,290
reality

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,870
I and a lot of time going around

86
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,690
organizations all over the world talking

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,060
to them about those compromises and how

88
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,340
they can maybe have less compromises

89
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,580
that is also important

90
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,280
getting as few compromises as possible

91
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,110
but the compromises are still going to

92
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,000
exist so I find those two articles

93
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,530
super interesting I think there's a

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,710
there's a podcast behind this one and

95
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:35,980
it's it's pretty awesome so let me go

96
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:38,230
back to me there we go so I have three

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,690
questions I don't know how long it's

98
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,270
going to take us to to answer them it

99
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,070
will take as long as it takes but and I

100
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,970
have three questions so far

101
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,200
the first one is um really so I would

102
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,840
summarize it as product owner versus

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,390
project manager I think the question was

104
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,270
what's the difference between a product

105
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:06,820
owner and a product manager or a project

106
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:11,490
manager I guess a PM versus Pio and I

107
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,860
think that that there's an interesting

108
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,860
piece there because they they're really

109
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,200
not the same thing if you if you look at

110
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,540
look at the scrum guide which went it's

111
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,910
good to mention in the scrum guide it

112
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,240
talks about the product owner as a role

113
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:31,390
all of the the roles in scrum are that

114
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,450
roles they're not job titles they're

115
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,990
just a thing that somebody does so the

116
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:42,280
the the product owner and is accountable

117
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:44,530
for value delivery in scrum if they're

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,790
accountable for value delivery they have

119
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:51,040
to be looking after the list of work

120
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,320
that people are going to work on they

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,210
need to understand what all of those

122
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,730
things are in that list of work they

123
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,000
need to present that list of work to

124
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,770
other people in the organization to make

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,130
sure everybody has the same

126
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:13,240
understanding of what those things are

127
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:15,400
and that idea and that they need to own

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,450
that and really understand that is

129
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,460
fundamental to them being able to do a

130
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,190
good job of providing value in the

131
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,450
organization I often talk about and I

132
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,030
think a lot of the other trainers do

133
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,790
that product owner should be fully

134
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,250
fiscally accountable they should be the

135
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,070
one here's here's your budget you have

136
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,890
your budget and you're spending it on

137
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,350
this product but they're not always the

138
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,610
case but that that is definitely a good

139
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:46,630
idea

140
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:50,860
so they care a lot about the market they

141
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:53,890
care a lot about how the product is

142
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,650
going to be used in production they care

143
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:00,070
about what the competitors are doing

144
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:04,660
they care about and what features users

145
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:07,180
need ok those are all things that a

146
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:10,240
typical project manager doesn't

147
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,340
necessarily care about I'm not saying

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,170
that all project managers are like this

149
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,610
just like not all product owners are

150
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,460
awesome

151
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:25,060
but the traditional project manager is

152
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:28,570
focused on delivering on a small subset

153
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:35,560
of items and their focus from beginning

154
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:39,190
to end is on on-time with the features

155
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,669
that were asked for and at the cost that

156
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:45,010
was indicated so on cost on time on

157
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,960
features is the traditional measure of

158
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,580
success for a project manager and that

159
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,520
kind of narrows the focus a little bit

160
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,360
to getting the thing done and you could

161
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,460
maybe ignore the idea of value delivery

162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,770
you could maybe not deliver as much

163
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,530
value as you could because there's that

164
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:08,590
focus on here's the piece of work let's

165
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,830
just get this done and that that can be

166
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,720
super awesome that's the the traditional

167
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:16,810
training for a project manager and and

168
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,870
there are many people out there who have

169
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,330
the role of project manager

170
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,400
but also have the role of product owner

171
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,200
even if their organization is not doing

172
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,350
scrum they're not called a product owner

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,930
they might have that hat to wear anyway

174
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,840
and and I think that's that's really the

175
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:39,100
distinction a project manager is looking

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:42,060
at a short time limited endeavor of work

177
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:48,150
that's on time on budget on scope and

178
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:51,310
whereas a product owner is looking

179
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:55,630
holistically and strategically across an

180
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:59,860
entire product and understanding and

181
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:02,260
ordering and expressing the vision nor

182
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,620
during the backlog based on that that

183
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,750
body of information so while there are

184
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,220
project managers who are also product

185
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,230
owners and product owners who were also

186
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,050
project managers I think you can see

187
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:17,680
that there's a very distinct difference

188
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:22,120
between those two roles and I think

189
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,700
there's a place for product owner in an

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,650
empirical process control system but

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,660
inside of an empirical process control

192
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:34,030
system there's not necessarily a place

193
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,830
for our project manager I'm not saying

194
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:39,430
that project managers are not useful I

195
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:42,130
am definitely not saying that but inside

196
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:47,530
that world of empirical process control

197
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:50,650
that we know less at the beginning then

198
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,810
we discover as we go the traditional

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:57,310
ideas around project management of

200
00:10:52,810 --> 00:11:00,310
having that scope up front having that

201
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:04,650
big budget up front and having those

202
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:08,710
resources available is a little bit

203
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:13,750
antagonistic to that idea of emergent

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:17,590
architecture emergent backlog emergent

205
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,360
budget potentially and it comes from a

206
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,570
good place it comes from those Taylor

207
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,680
istic ideas if you go watch one of my

208
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:31,060
previous sessions I talked about the the

209
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,400
tyranny of Taylorism and why that has

210
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,040
had a knock-on impact for the last

211
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,620
hundred years on the way we work and the

212
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,340
way the way we do things and I think

213
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,310
that that that led towards that project

214
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,960
manager and ideal we are as we're

215
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,520
switching over as an industry as

216
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,460
everyone's kind of focusing on that

217
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,530
shift over to product owner project

218
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,540
manager still are useful still have a

219
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,780
place in that world and but it's just

220
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,380
the right approach for the right type of

221
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,810
work which is good so that question was

222
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,540
what's the difference between a product

223
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,850
owner and a project manager and if you

224
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,080
have any questions at please feel free

225
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,930
to put them in the comments if you don't

226
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,310
want to ask a question publicly which

227
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,490
obviously putting in the comments is

228
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:29,470
gonna put your fingerprints all over

229
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:34,620
that then please use the link here and I

230
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:39,510
will get an anonymous question to answer

231
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,740
around scrum DevOps as your DevOps

232
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,870
technology question whatever or whatever

233
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,780
you you want technology scrum process

234
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,540
practice these people tools whatever I

235
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:53,110
will happily have a discussion around

236
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:57,070
anything so that brings us to the second

237
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,690
question uh the second question maybe

238
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:03,150
has a knock-on effect from the first one

239
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:07,120
is I I was asked a few days ago and

240
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,640
apart from the scrum team who else does

241
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,160
scrum affect

242
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,340
why does a why does anybody else in the

243
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,590
organization even even care and I think

244
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,710
that comes back to some of those idea

245
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:23,020
that I just talked about that and when

246
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,780
you have a defined approach and you know

247
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:29,200
a bunch of things upfront you can make

248
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:32,020
all of these concrete plans around how

249
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,310
things are going to happen when you can

250
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,350
do that and you would organize around a

251
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,020
different model and again that comes

252
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,030
from the terroristic approach that was

253
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,870
designed to manage factory workers where

254
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,620
you have a hierarchy of organization

255
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,690
because you have a bunch of people doing

256
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:54,670
the work those people doing the work

257
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:56,650
aren't and that the the phrase I'm

258
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,940
looking for it's not aren't smart enough

259
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:02,860
that's not correct it's they just don't

260
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,840
care about the work because it's boring

261
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,180
monotonous work if you think of screwing

262
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,370
the top on toothpaste bottles so a

263
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,070
hundred years ago that's how the top got

264
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,620
on your toothpaste bottle so and that

265
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,950
that disengagement from the work meant

266
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:20,920
that you wanted to have a foreman around

267
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,790
all the time and since the work that

268
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,220
we're doing is not cognitive we can have

269
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:30,970
somebody else plan our work so you have

270
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:33,340
the manager plans everybody's work and

271
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,230
they just follow the plan and end of

272
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,020
story we're done and then you might need

273
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,220
if you've got a lot of people you might

274
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,570
have a lot of managers and if you have a

275
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,790
lot of managers you might need a lot of

276
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,410
managers to manage the managers that

277
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,300
you're managing that's that's where

278
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,360
those hierarchies came from that idea of

279
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,650
organizing around at factory worker and

280
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,420
we're not in this work where you have a

281
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:57,100
lot of employees who are disengaging

282
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:01,920
from the process but the modern look at

283
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:04,810
things is having a small autonomous

284
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,810
cross-functional teams who can tackle

285
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:09,330
different types of work so you might you

286
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,400
might hear people talking about that

287
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:15,010
every team can tackle every type of work

288
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,900
I think that's a fallacy it's not a

289
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,570
reality of the different sorts of work

290
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,510
you might have a team that is slightly

291
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:25,000
marketing heavy but they're also going

292
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,330
to have representative from other parts

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,460
of the organization and the the the lock

294
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,089
n that we're in at the moment of silos

295
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,680
with

296
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,040
a marketing department a sales

297
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,420
department a contracts department

298
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,730
obscurity department whatever your

299
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,569
departments are called is a holdover

300
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:46,120
from those terroristic practices best

301
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:47,559
practices that came out of the

302
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,420
Industrial Revolution which were right

303
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,509
for that type of work just don't work so

304
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,699
well for the type of work that we do now

305
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:56,850
which is mostly cognitive so if you've

306
00:15:54,699 --> 00:16:00,339
got all those smart people who are

307
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:04,569
organizing themselves around solving the

308
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:06,970
problem then you don't need that manager

309
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:10,860
managing the people you need somebody

310
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:14,139
who would maybe be described as a leader

311
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:18,149
setting direction for those teams to

312
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:20,499
organize towards and potentially getting

313
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,139
you know let's find some problems and

314
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:27,339
get them out the way of people doing the

315
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:31,089
work so you transition from that idea of

316
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,529
of management to leadership and because

317
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,480
you're making that transition from

318
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,370
management to leadership almost

319
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,059
everything in your organization changes

320
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,189
how you're going to budget your your

321
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:44,740
your teams your project your your things

322
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:47,519
that are going on is is going to change

323
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,230
you're probably no longer thinking about

324
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,999
here's a budget for a project it's going

325
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,129
to last for two years and then it's

326
00:16:51,999 --> 00:17:02,589
going to be delivered you're thinking

327
00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:05,260
about and I have a flow of value that I

328
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:10,390
want to deliver in various categories

329
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:13,329
over the next few years and in that flow

330
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,520
of delivery things might shift and

331
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:17,470
change I might need more people over

332
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,620
here I might need more people over there

333
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,110
and I might not do this anymore I might

334
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,720
change direction the market might change

335
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,630
competitors might do stuff I want to be

336
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,299
able to adapt to that urban floor and so

337
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,279
I've still still got a finite amount of

338
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,710
money I have our I have a I have a

339
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,679
budget and but my budget really

340
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,710
translates to how many teams can I have

341
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,890
and then based on how many teams can I

342
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,679
have I will make a strategic decision

343
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,890
how many teams are allocated to each of

344
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,040
the value streams that I have in my

345
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,580
organization and those teams are then

346
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,160
going to do work against our product

347
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,690
backlog you may have one team doing work

348
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,820
in a value stream or you might have

349
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,130
multiple teams in a single value stream

350
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,380
and you might at some point have to move

351
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,870
a team from one value stream to another

352
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:15,120
value stream because we're doing okay in

353
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:18,669
this value stream we're meeting what our

354
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,140
competitor market is is looking at but

355
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,880
in this other value stream we're not

356
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,630
doing so well so maybe we have to pull a

357
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,220
team of skilled people off one value

358
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,169
stream and move them on to another value

359
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,299
stream and that can be difficult for

360
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:33,160
that team they may be shorts and skills

361
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,770
they may not understand a technology it

362
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,460
might be a different type of work that

363
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,299
they're doing

364
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,390
but ultimately that that that's

365
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,669
something they can learn you hired smart

366
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,820
people if you have a team of software

367
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:51,340
engineers that that have been doing java

368
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,110
for two years and give them a dotnet

369
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,750
project they're going to be able to do

370
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,690
it they might not be happy about it

371
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:03,760
but the technology is a material you've

372
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:06,820
hired smart people so that that that

373
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,559
applies across your organization as well

374
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,330
whatever different products you're

375
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,840
building whatever different situations

376
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,020
you were in if you create teams that are

377
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,940
able to deliver value for your

378
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,730
organization and work together

379
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:26,549
effectively they should be able to move

380
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:29,980
between different and valued domains

381
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:31,660
your value streams and the domains

382
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,970
within those streams and be able to

383
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,549
deliver in different contexts that's

384
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,770
that's so the way you build your teams

385
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,030
will be different the way you organize

386
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,160
your people will be different the way

387
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,600
you fund will be different the way you

388
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,330
manage them will be different the way

389
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,400
they are going to interact with the rest

390
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,360
of the organization is going to be

391
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,559
different and that that really all boils

392
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,979
down to everything is different in your

393
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:06,700
if you look at maybe a company like

394
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:09,999
Netflix who run as a holic recei that's

395
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,929
maybe one really far end of the spectrum

396
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:15,759
towards self-organization most

397
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:19,029
organizations are not going to get

398
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,729
anywhere near that any time soon but

399
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:24,429
that's that's there is something there

400
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:26,979
that they get value from and all the way

401
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:30,369
to the other end of the spectrum where

402
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:33,519
most governments set where you have very

403
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:35,349
tight controlled hierarchy and

404
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,469
bureaucracy

405
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:43,320
hopefully you're somewhere between those

406
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:45,579
two and moving in the direction towards

407
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,619
holacracy I'm not saying you're gonna

408
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,019
get to holacracy or even if holacracy is

409
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:51,999
your goal but that's kind of the general

410
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,549
direction we want to move to more

411
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:58,839
self-organizing teams and a greater

412
00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:03,190
degree of in the way of team ownership

413
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:06,820
and individual accountability and moving

414
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,239
that that floor along so that question

415
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:14,919
was apart from the scrum team who else

416
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:16,629
in my organization does from effect so

417
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:20,320
you can ask any questions you like in

418
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:24,339
the comments no problem this is streamed

419
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,869
out to I think four different platforms

420
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:32,169
so I'm happy for you to ask the comment

421
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:35,079
ask the question as the comment I am

422
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:38,679
losing the ability to speak English but

423
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:43,719
ask in the comments of any of the

424
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:46,690
platforms that you like and I will get

425
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:49,119
that question or if you don't want to

426
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:53,399
see that your publicly being asked the

427
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:57,099
question then please where is it here

428
00:21:53,399 --> 00:22:00,129
use this link here nkd agility net

429
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:05,079
forward slash ask which will take you to

430
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:07,179
a form with one text box and a little

431
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:09,360
warning that says I'll read out whatever

432
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:13,290
you put the text box but M

433
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:17,130
asked me a question in that text box so

434
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:20,960
that brings me to my final question that

435
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:27,860
actually came up during one of my

436
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:31,260
classes and it was I'm on sprint 22

437
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,390
should I be using story points with my

438
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,270
team should we still be doing planning

439
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:43,680
poker should we be doing all of those

440
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:45,480
things and I have a very no it's not

441
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,140
controversial but I have very strong

442
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,870
feelings about this I'm super happy for

443
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,590
teams that are just getting started that

444
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:59,550
need to just roll forward with an idea

445
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,200
that need to pack up process that pick a

446
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,960
practice that's super simple and

447
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,010
straightforward to pick story points

448
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,810
planning poker let's use velocity let's

449
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,080
do all of those things I would be super

450
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:15,720
happy for a team to start there but I'm

451
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,410
gonna be really unhappy if they're on

452
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,980
Sprint 22 and they're still doing kind

453
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:28,020
of stuff and it's story points while

454
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:30,940
easy to use easy to understand

455
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,809
[Music]

456
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:37,789
that's what happens when you click

457
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:41,600
buttons inappropriately the the the

458
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:43,190
teams are um what was I talking about

459
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,200
I was talking about story points yes if

460
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,240
they're still doing story points that I

461
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,249
would consider I'm still a very immature

462
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:54,679
team story points don't have a lot of

463
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:56,960
value beyond the team in the product

464
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,999
owner it's difficult to use them in any

465
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,190
other context it's difficult to gain of

466
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:04,940
understanding of how things are going in

467
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,610
the team in any other context and for

468
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,600
the team themselves there's limited you

469
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:15,440
sees within what the team are doing the

470
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,129
the different events in scrum for

471
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,649
example when they can use that data and

472
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:24,110
figure it out is is super super limited

473
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,769
but it is super simple and easy to

474
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,690
understand

475
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:27,889
so if you've got a baguette a team

476
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,049
that's just started out they're just

477
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:32,570
starting to do scrum story points

478
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:35,690
velocity awesome that will probably work

479
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:40,070
for them however I consider story points

480
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:42,379
an amateur team technique this team are

481
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,899
still amateurs once they move towards

482
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:47,929
being a more professional team once your

483
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:51,710
team is able to deliver a usable

484
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:53,990
increment working software at the end of

485
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,090
every single sprint and by working

486
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:58,190
software a usable increment I mean

487
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,039
something that you can put into

488
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,659
production that you could choose to that

489
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:09,649
the business could choose to is

490
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:11,450
technically there then once your team

491
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:16,220
has got there I would expect them to

492
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:18,830
start wanting to optimize what they're

493
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,139
doing how they're doing it a little bit

494
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,809
better make more process and technique

495
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:25,460
changes I'd be able to do that and one

496
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:29,029
of the things I would encourage them to

497
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:31,190
look at is is look at their floor and

498
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:34,850
bring in some of the the floor

499
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:38,659
techniques that you would see any Kanban

500
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:42,590
team doing so I would expect I would

501
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:45,740
want them to ditch burn downs ditch

502
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,600
below velocity graphs story points I

503
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,289
would I would kind of get rid of all of

504
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,900
that and focus instead on a flaw

505
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:57,220
does the the Kanban guide for scrum

506
00:25:53,900 --> 00:26:00,080
teams I wish was developed core

507
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,169
co-authored by Daniel Vacanti who was on

508
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,230
one of my sessions last week but he had

509
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:10,220
bad audio and Daniel and I are teaching

510
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:13,970
a professional scrum with Kanban class

511
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:17,059
in the Edinburgh British summer time

512
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:22,520
times on a virtual online class very

513
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:26,720
summertime in a few weeks so we'll be

514
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,700
teaching it online that is where we're

515
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,390
going to talk about a lot of those

516
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,880
techniques that we expect professional

517
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,340
teams to do and but you can download the

518
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,870
Kanban guide for scrum teams and that's

519
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,419
all open source get all the information

520
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:44,110
for free so what I would be wanting

521
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:46,760
teams to be doing is they want to be

522
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,179
looking at they're controlling their web

523
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,570
work in process so having a fixed number

524
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,159
of items that they have in total in

525
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,070
progress at any one time so that's

526
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:00,770
reducing the batch size of that and they

527
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,590
want to be looking at work item aging so

528
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,380
how long things take to get across that

529
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:10,880
board how lonely sit at sit there for

530
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:13,399
and looking at their their throughput

531
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,950
how many items are they delivering per

532
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,620
unit of time so rather than looking at

533
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,559
story points delivered per units of time

534
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,899
looking at items delivered per units of

535
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:27,230
time mean that in order to game the

536
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:31,610
system the team has to reduce the size

537
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:33,470
of the items and that's awesome I want

538
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,020
them to game the system in that way so

539
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:41,419
we're putting our set of metrics in

540
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:44,480
place that allow us to positive spin the

541
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:47,480
data but in a way that is actually

542
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,279
providing value for the organization so

543
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,320
we can reduce the batch size of

544
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,169
different items including story size

545
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,120
make them smaller they're going to flow

546
00:27:54,169 --> 00:28:01,130
through our system better

547
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,830
because we get we need to do less work

548
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,420
for each item so if things are flowing

549
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,910
through our system better we're actually

550
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:14,240
going to get more things delivered so

551
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:16,250
rather than focusing on getting more

552
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,700
more story points we're just focused on

553
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,890
getting more things delivered so if the

554
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,850
team are continuously taking on big-ass

555
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:28,490
chunky backlog items then their low is

556
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,920
gonna suck if they want to have better

557
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:34,190
flow write those things down make it

558
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,840
make me bat the game and that works

559
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,620
works really well so bringing those

560
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:44,870
Kanban metrics into a professional team

561
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:48,590
will allow that team to get better at

562
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:51,350
delivering software scrum is not the

563
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:55,270
be-all and end-all methodology that

564
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:59,840
you're going to use for forever it's a

565
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:03,560
framework that allows you to build your

566
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,590
custom most optimized for your people

567
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:10,100
and your business and your domain

568
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:13,430
process around that idea so you're not

569
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:17,330
meant to be just focusing on we're just

570
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:19,430
going to do scrum its scrum and what

571
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,680
else are you going to do to help

572
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,780
optimize that process I've seen many

573
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,110
teams that are doing what looks like

574
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,270
pretty good scrum but they still suck at

575
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,980
delivering working software at the end

576
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,680
of every sprint it's just difficult for

577
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,540
them because they start a whole bunch of

578
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,280
work they didn't really understand the

579
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,720
work before they started it they're not

580
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
doing enough for Fineman they don't

581
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,690
understand the things they've not broken

582
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:47,150
it that it can be a real mess so if

583
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,420
you're on sprint 22 and you're still

584
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:54,650
doing story points I would be looking to

585
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:58,180
the hem scrum master to encourage the

586
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:02,750
team to get a start upping their game

587
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:06,410
getting more advanced ideas in there so

588
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:09,680
I mean I'm I'm I would consider a team

589
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:12,260
on Sprint 22 to be looking at and

590
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,920
newest delivery I would want to see a

591
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,570
completely automated deployment pipeline

592
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,820
and to end that sure you're a lean

593
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,920
manufacturing floor in the software

594
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,780
world is your DevOps pipeline from the

595
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,310
time the engineer commits code til it

596
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,900
gets into production what does your

597
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,030
pipeline look like and how ultimately

598
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:35,480
does it it should be completely

599
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:37,520
automated and then things like so I put

600
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,070
upping the engineering game looking at

601
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,740
feature flags instead of branching so

602
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:44,630
moving to a single branching model

603
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,510
feature flags that's on the engineering

604
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,260
side and then on the process side

605
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,890
starting to bring in some of those

606
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:54,170
Kanban measures monitoring your floor

607
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:59,930
optimizing your flow over time while

608
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:03,560
still maintaining that planning cadence

609
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:06,950
that scrum offers for your business so

610
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:09,280
every two weeks you can get together to

611
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:12,730
shift and control strategic direction

612
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,310
but your process is continuously

613
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:18,590
delivering our software and value into

614
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:23,630
production potentially on a continuous

615
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:27,040
basis you can be planning tactical

616
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:30,440
direction on a two-week sprint while

617
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,870
delivering and testing and validating

618
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,960
your software and ideas in production

619
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:37,310
and twenty times a day but that's that's

620
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,190
going to work just fine and that's going

621
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:44,630
to be even more awesome than delivering

622
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:46,760
it just once every two weeks so if you

623
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,610
look at if you look at the scrum guide

624
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:54,290
to bring it up again you'll see that it

625
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:57,230
says at least once per sprint you should

626
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,630
be done it doesn't say you can't be done

627
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,250
20 times a sprint that's that's where

628
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:05,330
you want to get to and that's that's a

629
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:10,460
difficult progression so that was the

630
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:12,200
three questions that I had so I answered

631
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,230
it was the difference between a product

632
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,000
owner and a project manager or at least

633
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,490
I talked about it for a little while if

634
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,250
you had another follow-up question

635
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,149
please ask me apart from the scrum team

636
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,070
what

637
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:27,409
else's affected in the organization and

638
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,559
you should go take a look I did a

639
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,899
presentation for agile by example

640
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,349
conference that was recorded it should

641
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:38,779
be in my channel I think it's right at

642
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:41,809
the start of the conference's I spoke at

643
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:44,719
at list and in that when I talk about

644
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:49,129
what Microsoft had to change as they

645
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:50,929
moved towards their agile evolution some

646
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:54,830
teams inside a Microsoft spent the last

647
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:57,019
eight years moving from traditional

648
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:00,409
waterfall like everybody was doing all

649
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:03,859
the way through to being nimble agile

650
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:06,169
team of about 650 people working on one

651
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,309
product and that has progressed through

652
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:09,830
the rest of Microsoft so I did a

653
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:12,499
presentation on the changes inside of

654
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,809
Microsoft which is super funny I mean

655
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:18,469
they're they're they're now the poster

656
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:20,269
child of some of those success stories

657
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:26,809
on being able to make those changes that

658
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:33,109
quickly and I talked about if you're on

659
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:36,589
Sprint 22 so that's 44 weeks into your

660
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:38,179
scrum story should you still be using

661
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:40,099
story points with your team and I said

662
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,899
no you should be looking at the Kanban

663
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:45,169
guide for scrum teams and bringing in

664
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:49,219
the floor metrics that you need to

665
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:55,039
monitor your work cool so um if you're

666
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:59,690
interested next Monday which is the 20th

667
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,789
of you know with the lockdown I'm

668
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:05,239

of April so on Monday I will be teaching

671
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:19,760
professional agile leadership class in

672
