1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,279
as well just in case

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,359
just in case there's a problem

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
so is it just it's just the three of us

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,639
four of us

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,880
yeah well let's talk about board games

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,830
instead

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,170
so did you get my link for the mural

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,170
[Music]

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,560
perfect

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,039
i see you're in there uh i definitely

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,599
give you some recommendations

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
four for two player two player yeah two

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,960
player games

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,760
um i've got quite a few quite a few good

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
ones in that category and it depends it

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
depends how complicated you want to do

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,719
things

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,559
uh it's one of those things i was

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,600
looking at you know um

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,760
because

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,360
after after you put the kid to sleep we

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,640
just watched a tv but something

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,719
different from watching tv yeah i know

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,320
it's such a pain in the butt

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
you're sitting there watching tv going

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,740
like we could be doing something else

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,920
um

28
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,680
[Music]

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,799
it is a lot more interactive and that's

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,400
actually why i uh enjoy them because you

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
get a level of interaction that you

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
don't get

33
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,040
um

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,040
don't get

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
and that's where it depends how complex

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,479
the thing is

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,479
uh so whether you like stories

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
whether you like luck

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,320
so one of the first choices is whether

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,040
you like luck or you don't like luck

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,680
right that's one of your first choices

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,159
because american games are full of luck

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,280
so you're going to roll dice and then

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,159
you know so

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,799
you you're at the the behest of the dice

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
and then europe european games tend to

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,280
be more

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,159
um

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,880
uh strategy based so that you can get

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,680
games that are zero luck yeah it's all

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,040
about strategy um

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
so

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,439
let's oh i've got for some reason

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,200
there's a bit of text sitting in the

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,119
middle of that

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,159
i will ignore it

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,920
um

58
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
so if i just summon since there's only

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,319
uh four of us

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
we can we can we can do this

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
uh uh

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,959
just as a group we probably don't need

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,959
many breakout rooms okay

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
so

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
i've got a number of kind of statements

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,879
or questions or

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
um some things here so we can just go we

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,840
can just go through them

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,920
and see

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
uh what's going on

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,280
so the first one there is uh what are

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,840
requirements

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
what are they

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
i guess requirements

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,480
um

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
certain objectives of the business

77
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,599
needs in order to fulfill their

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,319
um decision making or

79
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,319
operational

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,239
um

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,239
needs

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,480
okay

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
so think things we need

84
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
yeah

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
perhaps

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
perhaps things that are required to

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,720
happen

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,840
perhaps things that are required to

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
happen that aren't happening yet

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,480
okay

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,310
what else um

92
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,310
[Music]

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,640
what else could requirements

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,040
be okay it could be a change on existing

95
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,560
process or system

96
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
yep could be a change to the existing

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,400
system enhancement

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
could be it could be compliance with

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,879
a law

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,560
yeah

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
okay

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
so what are not requirements

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
i think it is not i think i think it's

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
relative to the

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
user's

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,239
need so to speak so if they don't want

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
it then it's not a requirement

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,319
um

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
yes

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,840
i can i can definitely go with that

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
what else

112
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
anything out of scope

113
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,759
well it's still a

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
wow yes see that's why i don't like the

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,840
word requirement

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,400
right

117
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,199
because uh but it as a general thing

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
meaning something people want

119
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,280
um then it's okay for a requirement to

120
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,840
be able to scope right i would posit

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,720
that it's not really a requirement then

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,240
um but

123
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
uh

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
i would suggest that our requirements

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
are not solutions

126
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,080
right if you got the solution in there

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
um they're

128
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,479
they're the requirements don't

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,040
necessarily represent the final

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,040
deliverable

131
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
they're what we think we want

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
at the start which might not be the same

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,960
as what we need at the end

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
does that make sense yeah yeah yeah

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,400
they're not generally treated that way

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,759
are they

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,919
no

138
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
um so they're not a source of truth

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,639
about what the product does

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
so one of the common mistakes that i see

141
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,120
organizations make is they give the same

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,120
requirements to their engineers to build

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,800
and their testers to write test cases

144
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
for

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,840
now suddenly you've got

146
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,479
two different

147
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,320
opinions on what those requirements mean

148
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,919
and what happens when the testers go to

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,919
test what the engineers have created

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,440
it always fails

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
right it's almost never going to be

152
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,919
successful so you're maximizing the

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,720
amount of rework you're maximizing the

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,600
amount of consistency

155
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,120
um i i don't like the word requirements

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
for that reason i like the word

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,520
desirements stuff we would like the

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,440
product to do that it doesn't do yet i

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,960
think that just reflects what it is more

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,039
doesn't it

161
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
yeah yeah

162
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
um

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,080
how do you how do you do your

164
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
requirements just now

165
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
well i just started this week so i

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,960
haven't done

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,639
do you write user stories just now

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
we will be

169
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,479
but um i don't know maybe maybe dave

170
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
david has started something

171
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,120
well i probably haven't done anything i

172
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,960
do

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
receive requirements to people that

174
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
people want but i guess i've not really

175
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,160
been using an

176
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,720
agile methodology so in that way it's

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,199
hard to sort of give examples but i mean

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
asia very small small small contain

179
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
tasks but it's

180
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
you do you get you get a requirement you

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,880
get a request like i want this to do

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,039
that or yes so you get you get given a

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,039
solution

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
you are asked yeah you're asked to

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,720
implement a solution

186
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,800
i already know what problem i want to

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,919
solve i already know how i want it

188
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,039
solved

189
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,520
david just do this

190
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,360
to an extent yeah yeah yeah i know that

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,360
there's always wiggle room but yeah yeah

192
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,750
[Music]

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
where do you store your requirements

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,639
uh

195
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,319
at the moment for example we have sort

196
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,880
of a basic spreadsheet of okay

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
tasks and sort of notes and

198
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
things people said they wanted to do

199
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,199
with those tasks

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,199
very it's a very basic system

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
as your devops yeah

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
i i would definitely recommend not

203
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,440
storing them in excel

204
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,639
only because it's very difficult for two

205
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,240
people to edit it at the same time

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,319
um unless of course you start on

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
sharepoint and then maybe that's okay

208
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
uh but you can

209
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
if you like

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
the excel view

211
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,479
you can

212
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,160
plug

213
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,800
your excel sheet into azure devops um

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,479
and have your excel render a query from

215
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
azure devops in

216
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,199
excel and then you can do stuff with the

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,759
data

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
so if you if you like excel because it

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,960
gives you some extra special powers and

220
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,240
maybe david dura a excel

221
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
guru

222
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,479
who knows how to do all of the pivot

223
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,479
table craziness for for to get the data

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,479
and reports that you want

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,599
um there is a a plug-in for

226
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,800
office

227
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,719
uh which i can't remember what it's

228
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,159
called but it's the

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
visual studio

230
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,040
as your devops plug-in for office that's

231
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,560
probably the best query i've got

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,320
um and it it gives you uh the ability to

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,440
to to connect um an excel sheet

234
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,000
into

235
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
um azure devops and you can both

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,800
uh uh create

237
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,880
work items so if you already have all of

238
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
your data in excel you can just import

239
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,240
it into it into azure devops

240
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,080
there are some nuance to that but it can

241
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,480
be done reasonably easily

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,800
um

243
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,040
reasonably easily

244
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,600
and then you can you can have an

245
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,279
interactive sheet where you can see

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
here's all of my

247
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
features

248
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,160
uh here's the current state that they're

249
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
at and it will change dynamically and

250
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
stay up to date

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
so that's quite good

252
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,800
you know that is it that

253
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
interesting because i mean we are here

254
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
because we want to move away from just

255
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,120
having it on an excel table and into a

256
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
more important way of doing it yeah that

257
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
gives you a little bit of a halfway

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
house because lots people like excel

259
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,680
because they can do all the pivot table

260
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,399
malarkey um and and and they're they're

261
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,480
they understand excel functions but they

262
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
don't necessarily understand this new

263
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
azure devops thing and so it gets you

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
the best of both worlds

265
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
at least in the interim

266
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
don't tell anybody that there's also a

267
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,640
plug-in for ms project don't tell

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,959
anybody that

269
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,440
that's that's that's not a good idea

270
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,600
um but there is you can you can have if

271
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,760
you if you do a lot of if you use ms

272
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,800
project for dependency management you

273
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,040
can have it create the predecessor

274
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,959
successor links

275
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,240
in azure devops and then you can do

276
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
stuff with it you can actually do

277
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,000
dependency management in azure devops as

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
well

279
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,000
so there's probably i think is there a

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,279
session i think there is a session we're

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
going to have on

282
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,279
specifically on azure devops and how to

283
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
how to interact with it again we only

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,519
have 90 minutes i

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
i have i even have a five day class that

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
i run

287
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,160
just on how to use as your devops um so

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,720
we can definitely i can definitely show

289
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,720
you where all the features are

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
but maybe can't don't necessarily we

291
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
don't necessarily have time to dive into

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
how they all work right how you get use

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
and benefit out of them

294
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,399
so what what is a user story

295
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,640
if we've heard of this thing what is a

296
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,640
user story

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,120
anybody got a

298
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,079
is it talking in sort of a wide

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
way of

300
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,240
kind of how they want things to happen

301
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,360
oh that's a good one

302
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,279
talking in a wide way i like that

303
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,399
although wide means something different

304
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,600
in glasgow but i know what you

305
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
um

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,920
wide means you want to fight that's

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,160
that's what it means in it but you want

308
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
a conversation right so maybe maybe it

309
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,880
kind of kind of works out i guess a

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,720
fight is a conversation in glasgow i

311
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079
don't know

312
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
that seemed that seems perfectly

313
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,920
reasonable

314
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
has anybody been to glasgow

315
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,200
yes

316
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,360
does does that sound reasonable

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,880
no well technically i was only passing

318
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
through where i went to like a museum in

319
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,839
the city center just looked around let's

320
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
go

321
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
so i you probably went to the

322
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
the big

323
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,399
the car museum okay because

324
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,240
oh the the transport museum it's awesome

325
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,720
that's fun yeah yeah yeah yeah transport

326
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
museum's awesome then went to

327
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,360
one of the shopping streets i think

328
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,800
i would either be sucky hall street or

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,800
argyle street but sucky

330
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
we might be renaming it

331
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,839
okay because sucky hole

332
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,920
is

333
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,639
the surname of uh

334
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,399
evil person

335
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,480
who you know they used to like hold the

336
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
evil people up on pedestals and now

337
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,920
they're gonna

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,720
revisit that idea

339
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,680
um so i have so for me user stories i

340
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,480
know you asked the question is the

341
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,800
stories user story captures

342
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
what the um

343
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,360
what the user wants

344
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,279
um

345
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
why they want it

346
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,680
um maybe because of their rule or an

347
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
activity they need to do okay

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,959
it also captures

349
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
um how they know you'd have delivered

350
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,600
what they requested based on setting

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
high level

352
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,079
checks or

353
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,680
how they validate your delivered what

354
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,360
what they have requested but those are

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,680
kind of kind of like the key components

356
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
i i remember from user story so it

357
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
normally starts with something like i

358
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
want

359
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,360
xyz

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,360
because i am the tax manager running

361
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,279
all these reports and i know you have

362
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,079
given me this when

363
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,079
i can do x y z or something something

364
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,760
along those lines we are going to

365
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
definitely get to that but there are

366
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,399
some characteristics

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
of of user stories that we want to think

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,600
about

369
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,399
um so i've got a little uh it's called

370
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,000
the invest

371
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,760
circuit business

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,079
yeah yeah a lot of people are familiar

373
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,399
with invest like they've heard of it um

374
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,839
but maybe the the the implications

375
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,320
aren't always

376
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,079
uh clear so i've created this little uh

377
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,360
um

378
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,120
fun fun well i think it's fun exercise

379
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
we'll see if you think it's fun as well

380
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,519
uh welcome david are you on the mural

381
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,519
other david not david b david mcsee

382
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,199
your mic's very quiet and fading in and

383
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,000
out it might be that you're

384
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,480
i don't know if it's sticking up

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,480
let me shout out

386
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
ah

387
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,440
so you're on backup

388
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,440
yeah

389
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,880
what laptop are you using that's

390
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,120
terrible sound

391
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
uh a terrible laptop yeah yeah it sounds

392
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
like it you need to get yourself a

393
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,959
surface

394
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
they have they have a hd on the

395
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
directional microphones that filter out

396
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,040
background noise automatically at a

397
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,880
hardware level that's pretty cool

398
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,000
okay that's that's not what i'm on right

399
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,959
now i'm on i'm on mental levels of

400
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,560
uh

401
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,920
um

402
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
i don't know capability

403
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,279
it is

404
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,720
so i if if you're if you're are ever

405
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,279
looking for for stuff to augment

406
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
your home office i heartily recommend

407
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,680
elgato

408
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,120
as a as a product vendor they do

409
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,959
streaming for you know live streamers

410
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,959
um so they have good cameras they have

411
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,199
really good microphones that are in the

412
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,399
in in a

413
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,720
expensive but not too expensive range

414
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,160
but very the right price for the quality

415
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
if that makes sense

416
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,639
like you can go mental i've got

417
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,040
colleagues who have bought slr

418
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
cameras and don't get as good picture

419
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,720
quality as the camera i'm using right

420
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,720
now which was not 1500 pounds for an slr

421
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,600
yes i have an elgato uh face cam

422
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,920
um i don't have an elgato microphone but

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,639
i do recommend it over this one this one

424
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,440
is overly expensive for what it does uh

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,639
if i'd known that elgato existed i would

426
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
have gotten that

427
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,360
um

428
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
i really rate the elgato stuff so i've

429
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
got i've got elgato lights

430
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,839
um

431
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
a little elgato

432
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,680
boom

433
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
thing

434
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,360
um and various other elgato thing and an

435
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,279
elgato um green screen for when i need a

436
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,959
green screen which is not just now

437
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,720
because

438
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,959
you guys are friendly so i don't need a

439
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,959
green screen

440
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,959
uh so let's have a look at the the the

441
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,040
invest

442
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,480
circuit here that i've got let's start

443
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,279
with um independent

444
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
uh so

445
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,320
what are

446
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,199
what's the value

447
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,039
of of

448
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,439
stories or requirements or items that

449
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,880
are on your backlog what's what's the

450
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,880
value of them being independent

451
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,160
um it's a small task so um you can

452
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,160
teleport within the day

453
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,640
at the same time

454
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,039
concurrent development maybe yeah

455
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,880
well i like that idea

456
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,880
it prevents too many blockers

457
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,200
yeah prevents blockers that's a good one

458
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,480
also looks good when you start taking

459
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,640
them off

460
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,919
um

461
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
i'm actually going to put the

462
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,799
like checking there's a lot of power in

463
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
checking things off we've

464
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
i've done that thing awesome i feel good

465
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
right let's move on to the next thing

466
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,000
i i totally agree with that um

467
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,039
psychologically it is very very

468
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
important

469
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,440
yeah good for morale

470
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
um

471
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
well these are these are quite good uh

472
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
let's go let's let's go to

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,679
negotiable

474
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,000
what's the value in things being

475
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
negotiable

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,280
i was going to mention another point

477
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
there's always easy to

478
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,919
push back on smaller requirements in

479
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,360
your i mean

480
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,320
you've got loads of users so it's easier

481
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
to just

482
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
you know

483
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,720
push back on a couple of them because

484
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,480
it's not it's not a huge chunk of it

485
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,679
i agree and and

486
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,039
pushing back on it is

487
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,200
this one negotiable right prioritization

488
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,039
what what was that

489
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,039
it helps that way with prior

490
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,039
prioritization

491
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,360
i'm going to use ordering okay

492
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,919
and david you need to go look up

493
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,360
prioritization in the dictionary

494
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,559
does not mean what you think it means

495
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,559
but let's not go there

496
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,720
prioritization is a singular

497
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
you can only have one

498
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,559
when you prioritize something you make

499
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559
it the most important thing

500
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,120
but it's the one most important thing

501
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,280
whereas if you had three things that's

502
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,280
not prioritized

503
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,080
yeah it's one of those weird words that

504
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,760
is just

505
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,760
a bad spat word bad word

506
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
i don't know who invented that crap but

507
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,000
it was bad

508
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,200
it's probably one of shakespeare's words

509
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,400
you're pretty much

510
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,240
25 25 of all words in the english

511
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,120
language were invented

512
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
by shakespeare and therefore it's kind

513
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,559
of

514
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,760
25 reasonably accurate to say probably

515
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,240
shakespeare's fault

516
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,480
did anybody else know that

517
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,320
50 000 words

518
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,919
in the english language shakespeare just

519
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,960
made up

520
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,480
that's what it makes the english

521
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,440
language so difficult to learn it's not

522
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
your first language i i agree but you

523
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,360
can kind of ignore a lot of those

524
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,039
words

525
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
and i think the thing that makes it

526
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,360
difficult is

527
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,000
in a lot of other languages the

528
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,919
adjective comes before the noun whereas

529
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
here the noun comes before the adjective

530
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,240
is that the way it works

531
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,320
no yes the other way around so

532
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,559
a green kettle

533
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,559
right whereas in spanish it's kettle

534
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,360
green that really confuses my wife's

535
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
uh first language is spanish so

536
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,159
um

537
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,400
i have a lot of fun with some of those

538
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,520
things for sure

539
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,880
so what's the volume things being

540
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,159
negotiable actually my my mom's language

541
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,080
is the same as english like you do

542
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,440
being kept would be a green girl what

543
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,440
what's what what language is it

544
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
okay

545
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,159
yeah yeah

546
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
well see that's a sensible language then

547
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,520
that's the way i think about it does it

548
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,679
have gender

549
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,000
like does is a table feminine for no

550
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,840
reason whatsoever

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,840
cool i like i like that language

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,400
southern european languages all have

553
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,280
gender and they suck whereas germanic

554
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,679
germanic and uh celtic languages do not

555
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,840
have gender in in the words do you know

556
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,559
what's really funny the the the word in

557
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,840
spanish for gender neutral is masculine

558
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,840
isn't that hilarious

559
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
they've got they've got genders as well

560
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,000
yeah yeah

561
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,440
but it probably there's probably a

562
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,559
filter there from arabic and

563
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,720
greek

564
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,600
through to

565
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,520
that part the rest of the world yeah

566
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,039
it's either the greeks fault the romans

567
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,559
fault or

568
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,000
arabic's fault that's that's the way i

569
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
look at it

570
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,559
oh or shakespeare or shakespeare yeah

571
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,320
yeah they're all the culprits

572
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,799
um

573
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,559
i always find it funny that in

574
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,880
saudi arabia they don't use arabic

575
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,880
numerals they use indian numerals

576
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
you will know that the first when you

577
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,080
land and you're walking up to the

578
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,640
immigration test desk and the person

579
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,400
says go to desk four and you're like

580
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,080
what the hell one's desk four because

581
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,919
those numbers do not

582
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,280
relate to

583
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:31,280
uh arabic numerals it was very confusing

584
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:34,159
it's like lines and hash marks and stuff

585
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,799
i'm not familiar with indian numerals

586
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,799
oh that's true

587
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,840
it's a bit mental

588
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
back to negotiable

589
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
why is it important for things to be

590
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
negotiable

591
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,480
right oh flexibility

592
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,520
is going to be

593
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,120
especially when it comes to solutions

594
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
and deliverables you have to be flexible

595
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480
otherwise

596
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,559
you're asking for trouble

597
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,159
you're always going to get what you want

598
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,679
yeah so things kind of need to be

599
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,720
negotiable so we can be flexible

600
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
next one's valuable

601
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,400
why is it important for things to be

602
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
valuable i mean it sounds like that's a

603
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,559
no-brainer

604
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
yeah

605
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,679
no but if you have a thousand user

606
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,679
stories

607
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,480
and you try to give that to

608
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,320
you know your project team they're gonna

609
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,640
they're gonna laugh at you like

610
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,039
100 user stories for one requirement

611
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,159
for whatever it is so you're gonna

612
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,200
you're gonna

613
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,880
you're gonna

614
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,120
you know only pick the ones that you

615
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,960
actually need because otherwise you're

616
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,960
delivering too far out

617
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
selecting things we need

618
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,039
um

619
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,960
any other good good

620
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
reasons why things should be valuable

621
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,720
well you know the benefits it can help

622
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,720
you with the ordering of deliverables

623
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,120
well why would you even bother ordering

624
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,840
it at all if it wasn't valuable yeah

625
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,320
yeah yeah that's good

626
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
these are good

627
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,360
estimatable

628
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,039
why why what's the value in things being

629
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
estimated

630
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,159
you covered yesterday yesterday but

631
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,159
about

632
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,360
you know running analytics if you've got

633
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,679
loads of

634
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,240
broken down user stories you're able to

635
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,840
estimate okay look

636
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
given that the rate we're closing these

637
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,240
user stories you know how

638
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,039
how far off you will be

639
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
and complete the rest of it so planning

640
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,640
right planning planning just planning

641
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
yeah for planning and um

642
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,320
and sheddling as well you know which

643
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
sprint you can put it into and stuff

644
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,320
like that

645
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,480
i'm going to put understanding in there

646
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,200
if we can't estimate it

647
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,520
if if you look at that thing and go

648
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
ah that i don't i don't understand that

649
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,720
enough

650
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,960
to estimate it

651
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,640
can you take it into the sprint

652
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,760
no no because you don't understand it so

653
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
what the hell are you doing why are you

654
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,520
not refining that item

655
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,520
so estimating that to um

656
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,039
because if you've got a simple task

657
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,720
that'll take too long that means you

658
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,120
haven't got enough resources to complete

659
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,559
the smaller tasks

660
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,039
if a task you take one day he's taking

661
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,120
five days i missed that developers pc so

662
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,200
i've got a little tip it's a little bug

663
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,159
bearer of mine let's call them people

664
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,760
instead of resources

665
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,919
let's do that

666
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,880
uh

667
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:58,720
so it helps with people

668
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:03,200
right although you can't say peopling

669
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,200
but you can say resourcing yeah whatever

670
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
well

671
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,480
it could be

672
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,000
you're 25 likely to be too true um but

673
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,400
that

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,240
resources are replaceable

675
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,159
people are not

676
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,760
if you get another person to do the same

677
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,120
job they don't have the same knowledge

678
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,480
they don't have the same skills and they

679
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,480
don't have the same background

680
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,440
resources are something that that you

681
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,080
can easily replace like i have 500 backs

682
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,240
of bags of grain that's my resources

683
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,279
they're all roughly the same

684
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,600
um

685
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,679
but if i have two software developers i

686
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,440
can't necessarily swap one for the other

687
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,200
because one might be a net developer and

688
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,200
the other might be a java developer

689
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,720
that's that's a

690
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,360
poor example but

691
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,039
that's an easy to quantify example but

692
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,520
there are lots of not easy to quantify

693
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
examples

694
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,480
make sense

695
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,640
maybe some of you don't like working

696
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,159
with each other

697
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
right and it's you're not going to have

698
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
the same

699
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
investment in the in the story in the

700
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
thing you're building

701
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,240
so estimatable

702
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,840
why should things be small

703
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,960
i think we mentioned it before well we

704
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,960
mentioned ordering before

705
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,880
ordering is important for being small

706
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
what else

707
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,520
easy to come i'm quick to complete also

708
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,520
easy oh yeah uh

709
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,799
i'll put fast feedback that's probably

710
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,799
the phrase i like there

711
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
do you notice i have to look at my

712
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,919
keyboard when i'm tight typing anybody

713
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,919
else

714
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,840
shows how much i type

715
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,919
juicy's rest so this is good things

716
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,880
being small

717
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,880
how small should things be

718
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,320
small enough so that there's no major

719
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,320
overhead

720
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,679
small enough sometimes

721
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,440
i i like just small enough is probably

722
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,440
small a good one but so there's not

723
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,120
major overhead so there's a balance to

724
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,360
be had yeah

725
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,000
between making things too small

726
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,880
and the overhead is too high

727
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,310
like

728
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,720
um

729
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:31,120
[Music]

730
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,640
there's no point in taking five thousand

731
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
one minute

732
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,399
stories into the sprint

733
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,480
yeah right because you'll spend more

734
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,320
time

735
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
updating the work items and you will

736
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,720
actually doing the work

737
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,679
um

738
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
but the the the that they can be really

739
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,760
small

740
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,640
like i i would expect

741
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,440
in general i would expect a team to do

742
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,919
to do more than one story per day

743
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
that's what i would like to see as a

744
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,360
floor cadence

745
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,039
more than one thing per day being

746
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,640
delivered that's what i'd like to see

747
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,960
but yeah can't always get what you want

748
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,080
but the rule of thumb there is half the

749
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,200
length

750
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,840
of an iteration and that's from xp

751
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,559
extreme programming

752
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,279
oh here's a good one testable

753
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,279
why should things be testable

754
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,720
so you know if they

755
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,799
work

756
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,240
right that was uh because you you said

757
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,960
two things there done them and right

758
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,560
so that's if they're done and they work

759
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,840
right that's maybe maybe

760
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:57,039
[Music]

761
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,039
um so you can sign and sign off

762
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,720
okay

763
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,960
sign off

764
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,960
uh

765
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,940
validate business value

766
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,940
[Music]

767
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,200
well these are quite good we've got a

768
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,200
few things on there

769
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,520
what is how do you currently visualize

770
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,520
your work

771
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,360
how do you how do you do you get a

772
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,440
whiteboard

773
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,039
and draw pictures of what it is you want

774
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,440
to make and then collaborate on those

775
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,440
pictures

776
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
the larger tasks we do yeah

777
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,279
the nice thing about user interfaces

778
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,720
is every single person here speaks ux

779
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,440
and ui

780
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,600
right we all we all

781
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,000
think about products

782
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,760
in that way or we can all think about

783
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,360
products in that way and our customers

784
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,120
can as well

785
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,080
because that's how we interact with most

786
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,720
products

787
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
is ui

788
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,039
so user stories

789
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,559
were specifically designed

790
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,279
to describe

791
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,679
behaviors of users interacting with

792
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
products

793
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,559
they are not useful for non-functional

794
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,679
requirements

795
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,679
they are not useful for developing apis

796
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,760
they're useful for developing

797
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,080
things

798
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,679
that your users interact with

799
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,799
does that make sense

800
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,240
yeah

801
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,720
it is okay

802
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,880
to have both user stories

803
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,960
and use cases

804
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,480
and non-functional requirements on the

805
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,159
same backlog

806
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,840
everything on your backlog doesn't have

807
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
to be in the same format okay

808
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,120
yeah okay i just want to make make sure

809
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
because let's people try and fit weird

810
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,159
stuff into

811
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,720
into user stories

812
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,760
uh like like as a product owner i want

813
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,640
to support 30 000 simultaneous users so

814
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,000
that

815
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,080
i can have lots of business right

816
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
that's the most nonsensical user story

817
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,960
ever when you could just write must

818
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,799
support 50 000 simultaneous users

819
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
and you get the ideas and the intent

820
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,080
across with that simple statement

821
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,240
without having to do any thought

822
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,279
all right so this is a a little we're

823
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,720
going to do

824
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,919
we're going to talk about a few things

825
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,440
around

826
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,679
uh at this example here

827
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,640
so if if we had a whole day to do a

828
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,640
workshop i would do a bunch of examples

829
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,840
and have you

830
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
draw

831
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,360
your product

832
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,279
right or a page from your product or a

833
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,799
box from your product

834
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,399
uh but

835
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,519
since we don't have a day we've only got

836
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
90 minutes

837
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,640
and here's one i prepared earlier

838
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,399
it's not i stole it from somewhere

839
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,080
um but it's a

840
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,080
a system to hold recipes

841
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,360
right does anybody here cook anybody

842
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,640
cook

843
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,720
have you ever cooked your folder recipe

844
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,519
once in a while once in a while yeah

845
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
yeah

846
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,039
sometimes we just make it up as we go

847
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,799
along and see if it works yeah that's

848
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,120
the best way to do it

849
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,640
it's not always the best way

850
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,519
i'm gonna

851
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
i

852
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,240
don't don't try and make a sponge cake

853
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,840
that way because it will not work out

854
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,440
okay you want to follow a recipe till

855
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,799
you know what you're doing sometimes

856
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,000
following a recipe till you know what

857
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,000
you're doing is a good idea

858
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,399
how do you make bread well i need to be

859
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,919
able to make bread and then i can change

860
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,000
the recipe to suit my flavor and taste

861
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,000
so in this in this example we are

862
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,120
storing uh

863
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,240
a recipe with ingredients

864
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,919
right and then uh a notes for cooking

865
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
right so we've got a system that just

866
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,880
stores recipes and presents them to

867
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,480
users does that kind of make sense

868
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,840
yeah yeah

869
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,639
that's so that's that's that's our

870
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,919
that's our that's our context

871
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,839
um

872
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,919
so let let's

873
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,760
look at the anatomy

874
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,760
of a user story i know uh

875
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,040
jo jabel is that how you say your name

876
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,960
jabel yep cool

877
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,639
awesome i'm getting better at this

878
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,280
um

879
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,560
so jabel you mentioned i think it was

880
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,639
you that mentioned uh as a

881
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,159
some role i want

882
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,240
so that

883
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,720
format of a user story is this familiar

884
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,720
to you guys

885
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,839
yes

886
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,320
let me summon so we're looking at the

887
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,320
same thing on the mural

888
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,639
so that as a role

889
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,440
what might you have in that space where

890
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,440
it says roll

891
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,200
can you just

892
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,200
what you call

893
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
the person that's requesting your

894
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,200
business person

895
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,960
you might have a named business person

896
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,359
yeah as as bob from accounting

897
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,320
right i want yeah that's good because

898
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,480
it's incredibly specific

899
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,960
but you could you could just you could

900
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,280
generalize a little bit and say

901
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,200
um as a a

902
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,200
a year-end accounting user

903
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,079
right as opposed to as a monthly

904
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,359
accounting user

905
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,599
yeah so that that's okay too

906
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,000
but it needs to be much more specific

907
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,000
than user

908
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,240
i see a lot of user stories that just

909
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,240
say as a user i want and it's like no

910
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,960
that's you being lazy

911
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,560
let's figure out what user why user

912
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,760
yeah because the user stories i've used

913
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,119
in the past it always says as a user

914
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,920
yeah

915
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,839
because it it's it's too generic

916
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
right anybody's a user there's no

917
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,839
there's no intent there's no

918
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,240
understanding of who you're building it

919
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,920
for and that part of the user story is

920
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,960
supposed to tell us who we're building

921
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,960
it for

922
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,720
of course we're building it for users

923
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,200
everything's for users but which users

924
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,560
what are they trying to achieve

925
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,280
so we're going to have some examples for

926
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,280
this recipe uh system i think i've got

927
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,200
them below yes i do

928
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,119
uh in fact let's while we're talking

929
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,440
about aza

930
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,520
here i've got

931
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,599
recipe recorder

932
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
right somebody entering recipes into the

933
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,960
system

934
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
a chef who's following the recipe i

935
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,839
don't know if chef's probably a good

936
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,359
idea cooker might be better but um

937
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,480
as a chef recipe seeker

938
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,599
right so i'm looking for recipes

939
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,800
i i

940
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,760
an individual person david

941
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,079
you could be any of these

942
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,359
user roles couldn't you

943
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,839
yeah

944
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,160
in using the

945
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,400
system so it doesn't have to represent a

946
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,480
person it can represent

947
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,440
an intent

948
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,839
what is the intent of this user so

949
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,040
recipe recorder chef recipe seeker and

950
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,640
cook with existing ingredients

951
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,079
right why is cook with existing

952
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,960
ingredients important what does that

953
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,960
make you think of

954
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,880
i've seen it before and i know roughly

955
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,040
what i what i need to cook it but i've

956
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,079
forgotten a part of the recipe

957
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,480
or

958
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,800
here's the stuff i've got in my fridge

959
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,480
what can i make with it

960
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,520
oh yes

961
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,800
yeah

962
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,240
how often have you gone to the fridge

963
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
and opened it and gone what the hell can

964
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,720
i make

965
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,640
pop it in and pop it into the the system

966
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,040
search based on

967
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,480
ingredients you have

968
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,720
right questions

969
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,720
yeah

970
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,520
yes david

971
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,520
your microphone is horrendous you're

972
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,520
fading in and out

973
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,640
let me talk about it

974
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,640
yeah yeah yeah that works sometimes it's

975
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,880
awesome and sometimes it's just not very

976
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,880
good

977
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
like at the start of your question it's

978
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
awesome and then it kind of fades out i

979
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,880
don't know what

980
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
what's happening with your

981
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,599
did everybody else hear the same thing

982
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
as me

983
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,280
yeah

984
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,599
as well yeah it's not not just me then

985
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,800
that works

986
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,480
it's always the thing when you're in one

987
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,599
of these meetings is it just me or is it

988
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,599
everybody yeah yeah

989
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
that's why i can't move out i can't move

990
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,200
house

991
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,920
i can't move house i'm in one of the few

992
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,359
houses in my area that have virgin media

993
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,000
and i get uh i get gigabit internet here

994
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,599
everywhere else it's 80 megabit on bt

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
and i am not willing to suffer through

996
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,680
that

997
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,800
uh

998
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,599
do you compile the draft user list

999
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,800
before creating stories

1000
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,960
i think it's a good idea

1001
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,000
the first time you start to think about

1002
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,119
users yeah i i potentially would create

1003
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
this list

1004
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,720
i would say what what are the

1005
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,320
the high level activities

1006
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,200
that users are going to do in this

1007
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,920
category um so

1008
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,079
entering entering recipes following

1009
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,040
recipes

1010
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,800
finding recipes and that extra one there

1011
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,320
is cooked with existing ingredients i

1012
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,760
would have that list first before i

1013
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,240
started creating

1014
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,160
we might find more as we go

1015
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,880
but i want to start with

1016
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,079
um with some kind of list

1017
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,880
it's kind of how you know who you're

1018
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,880
building your product for

1019
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,720
um and then the second part is i want a

1020
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
feature

1021
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,720
right

1022
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:10,280
what is the user trying to achieve

1023
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,280
what's their goal

1024
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
right

1025
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,800
and then the third part is what do they

1026
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,119
get out of it why do they want this

1027
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,599
so a good example of that

1028
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,560
is uh many years ago when i worked for

1029
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:28,720
merrill lynch i had to build um a

1030
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,640
crm system

1031
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,160
for for for a group of people

1032
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
and as

1033
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,120
as a

1034
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,599
um

1035
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,520
[Music]

1036
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,720
call center

1037
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,319
member

1038
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,560
i want

1039
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,880
a list of

1040
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,880
people

1041
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,160
right

1042
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,720
so you as a developer

1043
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,200
go off and create

1044
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
a list of people first name surname

1045
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,880
address

1046
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,040
right that sounds pretty good doesn't it

1047
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,160
mortgage company first name surname

1048
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,400
address

1049
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,319
value of local properties i don't know

1050
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,040
something like that

1051
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,720
but

1052
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
i did that and i completely missed the

1053
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,480
point and they came back and said

1054
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,720
what we want to easily call people

1055
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
we want to phone them

1056
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,119
so having the phone number in the first

1057
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,560
list is probably a good idea

1058
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,400
right so this

1059
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,240
why do they want to use it what are they

1060
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,599
trying to achieve i want to call people

1061
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,280
okay what are you going to talk about on

1062
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,359
this call we're going to talk about

1063
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,400
renewing their mortgage okay maybe you

1064
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,839
want to surface some of that information

1065
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,560
on that that that view

1066
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,560
does that make sense

1067
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
yes

1068
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,640
so i have three

1069
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,040
uh

1070
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,680
three user stories here

1071
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,839
as a recipe seeker

1072
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,839
i want to search by tag values

1073
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,240
so that i can find recipes via ad hoc

1074
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:05,280
tags i like uh

1075
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
i like

1076
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
jolof rice

1077
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,119
right

1078
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,240
so i want to to to see all recipes

1079
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,800
tagged

1080
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,599
uh with jill off that particular flavor

1081
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,040
of the rice um so that i can see what

1082
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,520
are all the different things that i can

1083
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,839
make the meals that i can make that go

1084
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,359
with go with that item

1085
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,560
right that could be a thing that i want

1086
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,400
to search for

1087
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,720
and maybe maybe stretching the

1088
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,920
determination of tag there

1089
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,720
as a recipe recorder i want to tag my

1090
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,680
recipes so that i can find them

1091
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,240
via ad hoc tags

1092
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,920
right so there's there's a searcher and

1093
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,160
a recorder both want tags

1094
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,240
right so we may implement both of those

1095
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,240
stories as a single thing might we

1096
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,079
but they have different intent different

1097
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,040
activity

1098
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,040
so one is uh um

1099
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,839
searching

1100
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,000
by tags the other one is adding recipes

1101
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,880
and adding tags so adding tags

1102
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,920
and then as a recipe seeker

1103
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,920
i want to search by recipe ingredient so

1104
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,079
that i can find recipes for things i

1105
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,520
have

1106
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,760
those all sound pretty reasonable don't

1107
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,760
they

1108
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,079
sorry i think your audio is dropping in

1109
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,000
and out there miners

1110
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,880
yeah i don't know just me or for other

1111
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
people

1112
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,760
sorry it was just me

1113
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,760
was it for everybody or just me or just

1114
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,240
i'm not sure if the headset disconnected

1115
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,880
reconnecting or yeah he keeps cutting

1116
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,880
out of it

1117
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,800
i i just changed my

1118
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,480
settings

1119
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,119
so let's see if it uh it perseveres

1120
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,079
let me let me check that again

1121
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,800
yeah

1122
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,800
nice oppression is off

1123
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,960
i'm on crisp

1124
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,720
how am i signing now

1125
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,160
okay you said you sound good now yeah

1126
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,920
your video is fine but that's another

1127
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,440
thing that's weird you get a whole drop

1128
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,720
out but it's just it was just the audio

1129
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,119
for a little bit there then it's

1130
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,040
probably it was probably my my system

1131
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,040
but i have um

1132
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,040
i've tweaked it so hopefully it'll um

1133
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,800
it'll just work

1134
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,359
cheers

1135
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,359
so

1136
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,720
yeah yeah i need an elgato mic instead

1137
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,119
of my my crappy blue yeti

1138
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,560
x pro thing

1139
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,599
um it's actually my second one

1140
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,920
because the other one kept crashing

1141
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,880
imagine the microphone crashing how

1142
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,880
complicated is it

1143
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,040
so let's look at uh we'll probably just

1144
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,920
do one of these

1145
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,920
um so i have

1146
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,800
i perhaps gonna gonna gonna draw

1147
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,480
um

1148
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,319
my my

1149
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,160
ui

1150
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,720
and then

1151
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,720
we need to have a conversation

1152
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,880
right and part of those things that

1153
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,440
allow us

1154
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,160
to see the behaviors that we have on

1155
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,000
this ui if you were looking at this ui

1156
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,599
you might have a conversation with your

1157
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,640
your product owner or with your team or

1158
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,880
with your stakeholders right some users

1159
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,839
um and say well what happens when you

1160
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,839
click on the home link

1161
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,280
right what happens

1162
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,760
uh

1163
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,680
can we sort this data grid would you

1164
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,040
like to be able to sort it

1165
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,440
what happens when the cancel button is

1166
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,440
clicked

1167
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,280
what about if no ingredients are entered

1168
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,440
if there are no ingredients entered what

1169
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,319
what happens well we want the the add

1170
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,920
button to be disabled okay so you can't

1171
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,920
add a recipe with no ingredients

1172
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,040
that make sense

1173
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,280
part of that conversation

1174
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,640
so where's me uh

1175
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,200
um

1176
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,800
[Music]

1177
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,839
uh seeker

1178
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,160
search

1179
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,160
recorder add tags let's do this one

1180
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,440
what questions

1181
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,480
might you have i'm gonna be your product

1182
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
owner

1183
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,680
i don't have my hat here but i'm gonna

1184
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,040
be your product owner

1185
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,400
um

1186
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:54,640
so the the user store we want to discuss

1187
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,760
is as a recipe recorder i want to tag my

1188
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,119
recipes so that i can find them

1189
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,119
via ad hoc tags

1190
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,960
what questions do you have

1191
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,240
what form do you want that tagging to

1192
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,319
take is it a flag is it a text now is it

1193
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,319
uh

1194
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:20,559
so are we selecting tags or

1195
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,680
text entering is that what you're asking

1196
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,680
yes

1197
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,680
so

1198
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,319
um

1199
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,200
also generated from

1200
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,200
other information you've input

1201
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,359
okay

1202
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,160
there's some more low-level things that

1203
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,680
are are i think more important here

1204
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,680
right you're going to be adding tags

1205
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,160
what questions might you have for the

1206
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,160
product tour

1207
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,400
how about the tanks think about the tags

1208
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,640
what form the tags take okay what does

1209
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,599
that mean

1210
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,319
uh

1211
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,559
do you is it like a are you

1212
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,319
is the tag the form of a flag did it

1213
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,240
like fight did you write it out five

1214
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,200
stars is it just text do you try and

1215
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,359
capture text it's it's a it's like a tag

1216
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,359
with words

1217
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,200
sorry my headset keeps muting me

1218
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,680
keywords

1219
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,920
yes

1220
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,920
it's keywords

1221
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,160
so it is keywords

1222
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,640
so now you know its keywords would you

1223
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,640
want to ask me

1224
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,240
david

1225
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,640
david they'll get to dave the other dave

1226
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,440
is gone it's just you

1227
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,440
answer the question

1228
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,160
uh we are

1229
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,520
on as a recipe recorder i want to tag my

1230
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:11,359
recipes so that i can find them via

1231
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,359
tags so we're adding new recipes

1232
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,920
do you want a list of tags provided to

1233
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,160
you already existing tags

1234
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,160
uh

1235
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,280
we can add that when it's enough

1236
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,760
different

1237
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,520
um

1238
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,839
[Music]

1239
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,839
should we

1240
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,720
right so i think that goes with these

1241
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,720
these three

1242
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,640
right

1243
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,640
but if we know that the recipes are

1244
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
keywords

1245
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,640
if you've got to type something what are

1246
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,640
the important questions to ask

1247
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,599
it's the input method

1248
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,599
the keyboards probably

1249
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,520
what do you mean by what's the input

1250
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,000
method

1251
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,200
um i suppose it's been how how people

1252
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,640
are doing what they're doing computer so

1253
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,280
they've got a nice big keyboard or are

1254
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,359
they on a phone so they might also

1255
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,680
use voice recognition

1256
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,680
both uh phone and

1257
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,520
uh um and we're gonna leave voice

1258
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,280
recognition and stuff that's up to

1259
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:21,520
that's the platform issue that's not our

1260
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,520
problem

1261
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,599
you're building a web page allows people

1262
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,720
to enter recipes

1263
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,720
they add tags

1264
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,400
do you want it to

1265
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,280
what's it

1266
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,520
um

1267
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,200
to autofill when you're typing so once

1268
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,200
you start typing it starts to kill you

1269
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,240
okay such as suggestions i think it

1270
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,240
doesn't suggestion

1271
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,800
um i i would like that but not for the

1272
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,640
first version

1273
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,640
okay okay

1274
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,160
do you want it to like auto spell

1275
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,440
at the end for the for the for the next

1276
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,119
version

1277
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,079
okay

1278
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:02,240
it's way more important low level stuff

1279
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,240
okay

1280
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,760
again we're not doing searching we're

1281
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,760
doing adding

1282
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,960
so i have here's some pre-prepared

1283
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,960
questions

1284
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,319
what really big tags can i have a tag

1285
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,839
that's super color fragilistic

1286
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,920
expialidocious is that okay

1287
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,760
yeah so length of the tags how many

1288
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,680
characters do you want do you want your

1289
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,599
characters in there is a two letter tag

1290
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,280
okay

1291
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,400
or does that add no value

1292
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,400
probably adds no value

1293
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,680
what what if somebody enters a space

1294
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,000
are we comma delimiting the tags are we

1295
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,160
space delimiting the tags can we have a

1296
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,280
tag that's two words or are they all one

1297
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,960
words can they use a dash in those tags

1298
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,240
special characters special character

1299
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,800
yeah what do we do with special

1300
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,800
characters

1301
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:06,160
is it all english are the numbers is it

1302
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,680
can you have

1303
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,680
are we going to support other languages

1304
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,440
these are these are the questions that

1305
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,040
are business decisions

1306
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,359
that matter

1307
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,480
from an engineer's perspective i've got

1308
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,599
to go implement this in the system

1309
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,160
so what questions do i need answered

1310
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,920
because if they're not there just now

1311
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,839
i might just i might just make a

1312
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,920
decision

1313
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,319
later if you're if you're an engineer

1314
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,400
and somebody asks you to add tags you'll

1315
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:41,280
just go well this is how i like tags to

1316
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,440
work so i'll build it that way

1317
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,280
but these are business decisions

1318
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:50,880
this is this is behavioral decisions

1319
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,880
these are not technical decisions

1320
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,400
restrictions on who can add taxes

1321
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,280
can everyone add tags or only admins can

1322
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,599
people select tags can they add new ones

1323
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,720
right who can add new yeah all of those

1324
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,319
questions

1325
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,920
we should be generating as we're

1326
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:11,040
thinking about and talking about and

1327
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,559
discussing that that user story

1328
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,839
what what do we do with all of this

1329
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,839
information that we've just collected

1330
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,599
what could we do with it

1331
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,680
i hope

1332
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,680
you're writing it down

1333
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,240
right you need to write down the answer

1334
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,000
somewhere don't you

1335
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,839
it's been recorded it needs to be

1336
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,280
recorded somewhere

1337
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:39,040
right because if it's not recorded

1338
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,640
somewhere what's going to happen

1339
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,559
you'll come back again

1340
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,839
i i but you're gonna you're gonna show

1341
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,160
the product owner you're gonna show the

1342
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,400
stakeholders at the end of the sprint

1343
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,760
and what are they gonna say

1344
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,000
that's not what i want it's not what i

1345
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,079
wanted we talked about this

1346
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,280
we talked about it

1347
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,559
yeah

1348
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,680
so we we we need to remember to ask

1349
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,920
questions

1350
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,960
dive into the details and it doesn't

1351
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
matter

1352
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,319
how pedantic those details are

1353
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,599
right if the if the product owner says

1354
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,800
it doesn't matter you can literally

1355
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,680
write

1356
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,960
length of the tag doesn't matter

1357
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,960
on the user story right

1358
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,240
but because you wrote it on the user

1359
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,960
story

1360
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,280
what's your product owner gonna think

1361
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,319
well [Â __Â ] maybe it does matter right if

1362
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,839
you're gonna write it down

1363
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:34,880
maybe i do need to have an answer for

1364
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,559
that okay well let's let's

1365
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,319
what are my choices right because maybe

1366
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,520
the product owner doesn't understand the

1367
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:42,079
question

1368
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,040
yeah right and you can say well if

1369
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,119
er er you as an engineer might say well

1370
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,799
if the tags are if the words are really

1371
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,119
long

1372
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,599
how are we going to fit them on the ui

1373
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,920
how much space do we have on the ui

1374
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,599
how many tags are we going to display

1375
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,520
you know all of those kind of things you

1376
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,480
can you can talk through it you can draw

1377
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,040
it

1378
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,040
on the screen

1379
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,280

1383
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,880
them down

1384
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,319

bye-bye

1390
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,119
uh uh me me hi was talking about i'm

1391
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,640
doing a a free public workshop on

1392
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,799
definition of done

1393
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,160
uh this afternoon pretty much straight

1394
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,319
after this but not quite 4 30 till

1395
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,720
[Music]

1396
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,880
4 30 till 6.

1397
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,160
um

1398
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:48,079
so if we're going to write them down

1399
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:51,920
how are we going to write them down

1400
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,920
who here is familiar with scenarios

1401
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,359
have you heard the term scenarios

1402
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,319
yeah

1403
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:03,440
have you used them david

1404
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,280
not recently and and sort of at a higher

1405
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,400
level

1406
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,880
so here's

1407
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,040
taking that uh that discussions with a

1408
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,760
discussion and we ended up with three

1409
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,280
character minimum and no spaces right

1410
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,119
that might have been the answers that we

1411
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,280
got

1412
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,200
so then we need to look at what does

1413
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,280
what does that actually

1414
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,119
look like what's the behavior of the

1415
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,240
application because behaviors of the

1416
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:30,400
application are business requirements

1417
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,920
not engineering decisions

1418
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,680
okay

1419
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,119
so given a tag value of less than three

1420
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,920
characters

1421
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,799
when it is entered then it is not saved

1422
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,359
and the user is alerted about the tag

1423
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:47,359
length

1424
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,720
does that make sense

1425
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,920
yeah

1426
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,480
because

1427
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,440
your next question after tags can only

1428
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,200
be three characters in length is

1429
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,839
what if i enter a tag of two characters

1430
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,839
what happens then

1431
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,240
yeah how many how many times have you

1432
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,440
ever been on in an application

1433
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:10,240
and you've filled out the form exactly

1434
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,839
like it says and you hit submit and it

1435
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,720
doesn't work and it doesn't give you a

1436
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:16,160
warning for anything

1437
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,799
because somebody didn't have this

1438
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,799
conversation

1439
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,280
they didn't think about that option

1440
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:28,799
my favorite one is i

1441
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,520
my surname is quite long

1442
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,359
right henshaw wood

1443
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,520
luckily my daughter's first name is long

1444
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,839
so it's evangelina

1445
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,599
hinchelwood right so that makes it even

1446
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,240
longer but i used to work for a company

1447
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,640
called the graduate network

1448
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,280
and my and it was in the uk so my email

1449
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,920
address was martin.hinchellwood

1450
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,920
at the graduate network dot co uk

1451
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,319
yes what happened when i went to try and

1452
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,040
fill out my email address on forms all

1453
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,040
over the internet

1454
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,720
what oh i can't have any more characters

1455
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,960
halfway through the graduate network no

1456
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,960
more characters

1457
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,760
bad

1458
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,599
right is there any reason to restrict

1459
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,720
the length of email address

1460
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,960
nope

1461
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,440
there's no reason to restrict it

1462
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,440
what's the

1463
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:25,200
let me know what the what the maximum

1464
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,200
length of an email address is

1465
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,000
basically though

1466
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,559
max of an email address is 320

1467
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,720
characters

1468
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:41,680
that is the official

1469
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,680
um and it's

1470
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,359
so the first part i think is a maximum

1471
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,920
of 64 characters before the act

1472
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:55,520
that might be true

1473
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,520
not 100 sure that's true

1474
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,319
um

1475
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,760
oh well okay maybe

1476
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,200
yeah

1477
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,440
64.

1478
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,720
and so those of you that are geeks well

1479
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,400
we'll know why

1480
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,799
64 characters before the act 255 after

1481
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,799
the act

1482
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,440
number two

1483
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,799
bits isn't it

1484
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,640
binary

1485
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,319
yeah yeah it's because of it's it's

1486
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,480
because of madness

1487
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,319
um

1488
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,599
so

1489
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,880
that that restriction is is is not good

1490
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,480
and then it just pops up a warning

1491
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,079
saying you've entered an invalid email

1492
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,839
address and i'm like no [Â __Â ] i've rented

1493
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,079
a valid email address i can't fill out

1494
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:40,000
my email address how many times have you

1495
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,000
had that happen on forms not that

1496
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,680
particular circumstance but

1497
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,680
you can't fill out the correct answer

1498
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,880
yeah yeah and then they say at the

1499
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,520
bottom if you have answered any of these

1500
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,359
questions incorrectly

1501
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,520
right you may be prosecuted under blah

1502
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,880
blah blah like but you wouldn't allow me

1503
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,480
to answer them correctly i've actually

1504
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,319
had to do that with a form recently i

1505
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,440
had to fill out a government

1506
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,040
um

1507
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,680
procurement

1508
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,599
form and it didn't give me any of the

1509
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,400
options that were correct

1510
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,559
so i had to fill out the form in the way

1511
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,520
that it wanted it because it was an erp

1512
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:18,000
system

1513
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,920
in order to submit it

1514
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
and then i had to email the people that

1515
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,160
i was dealing with and say here's the

1516
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,680
answers i had to fill out

1517
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,119
here's the truth

1518
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,720
here's why i couldn't fill it out

1519
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,799
correctly

1520
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,079
and they're like yeah whatever right but

1521
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:36,799
now i've told them i'm off the hook

1522
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,559
yeah yeah right

1523
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,319
but i couldn't fill out the form

1524
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,960
it didn't have the options that

1525
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:45,359
i needed so there's no spaces given a

1526
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,680
tag with spaces is entered when it is

1527
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:50,079
saved then the spaces are removed and

1528
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,520
the tag is camel cased right there's a

1529
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,960
decision made

1530
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,480
that's quite a complex decision isn't it

1531
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,200
that's probably the result of a bunch of

1532
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,200
conversations

1533
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,240
but they are all at business decisions

1534
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,200
so what does that that look like

1535
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,520
um well you would maybe have a title to

1536
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,920
your user story and the the the

1537
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:15,200
conversation

1538
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,480
right the three c's of a user story are

1539
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,400
a card

1540
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,319
a conversation and confirmation

1541
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,280
right that's the three c's of user

1542
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,839
stories

1543
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,240
so we've got a title a description and

1544
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,200
then some acceptance criteria and in

1545
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:33,440
this case we're writing it as scenarios

1546
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:36,400
right scenarios are a really good way to

1547
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:38,640
to to caveat that because if you think

1548
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,920
about that one where the user is alerted

1549
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:45,440
about the tag length um

1550
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,200
what actually happens if it's not true

1551
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,960
right have those conversations and then

1552
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,359
you would take this

1553
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,599
ux this picture

1554
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,280
and break it down into

1555
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,039
a bunch of user stories and then each

1556
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,960
story breaks down into a bunch of

1557
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,960
scenarios we've had some conversations

1558
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,839
so pragmatic point then

1559
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,839
yep

1560
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,440
oh you went you went on mute

1561
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,520
keeps dropping me onto mute annoyingly

1562
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,119
i'm not sure why um

1563
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,760
pragmatic conversation does people's

1564
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,599
time is valuable and it is presumably

1565
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,960
plausible to have a very very large

1566
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,960
number of scenarios yep what's the where

1567
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,760
do you place the threshold of value

1568
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,039
because you could just go into sort of

1569
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,280
the

1570
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,480
infinitesimal level of detail and you

1571
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,079
never actually get around to building

1572
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,880
anything because you've just documented

1573
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,319
out

1574
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,000
either scenarios that would never

1575
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,240
you went on mute again halfway through

1576
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,720
that again yeah

1577
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,319
you either end up documenting like

1578
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,319
really niche edge scenarios that will

1579
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,559
never happen or things that are so

1580
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:57,039
common that

1581
01:02:54,559 --> 01:03:00,079
it's not worth capturing them

1582
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,920
i i disagree that they're so common it's

1583
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,799
not worth capturing them but you might

1584
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,680
not have to go into any level of detail

1585
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:07,440
right

1586
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,520
you should you should maybe it's just a

1587
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,520
sentence that says yeah and obviously

1588
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,200
this doesn't happen and obviously that

1589
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:17,359
doesn't happen

1590
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:20,319
right would you would you use

1591
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,640
you went on mute again after would you

1592
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,319
right um but would you

1593
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,799
well so would you capture there that you

1594
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,240
know i want the system to use

1595
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,319
uh english

1596
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,839
as in people to type and use ascii

1597
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,400
english

1598
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:36,400
or is that just a given or is that one

1599
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,000
of those things that's so common

1600
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,760
it's so obvious but it's still worth

1601
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,720
capturing in a sentence in the user's

1602
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,480
story oh i i might have that captured at

1603
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,039
a higher level

1604
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,640
right okay so when we're talking about

1605
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,359
the system

1606
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,359
we will have some things that are true

1607
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,160
for everything

1608
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:58,000
like

1609
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,599
uh and and the system supports english

1610
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,599
okay yes

1611
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:03,760
does it so the event if somebody says

1612
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,319
and the system supports english an

1613
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,400
engineer's going to ask you

1614
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,839
does it support any other languages

1615
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,480
you were like no

1616
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,599
what about welsh aren't we required to

1617
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:19,200
support welsh and gaelic and

1618
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,720
in in in the uk for systems oh oh yeah

1619
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,240
maybe we are

1620
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,000
let me get back to you on that right so

1621
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,440
you've asked the question you've

1622
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,400
potentially got an answer because that

1623
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,119
is a business decision

1624
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,880
yeah yeah um our

1625
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:36,799
questions at that level

1626
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,400
are also things around at myopias

1627
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,480
right are we are we

1628
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,160
how does our system handle people with

1629
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,920
various disabilities

1630
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,359
are we going to handle that or are we

1631
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,039
not going to handle that are we going to

1632
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,880
support tax readers or are we not going

1633
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,559
to support tax readers

1634
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,400
so these are more non-functional

1635
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,200
requirements though yeah these these are

1636
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:57,680
i'm supporting english or or or support

1637
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,200
supporting klingon are

1638
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:00,640
yeah non-functional that's an actual

1639
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,680
language don't laugh

1640
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,200
um

1641
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,240
you can get a university degree in that

1642
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,599
that stuff

1643
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,680
um

1644
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,440
it is yeah these are these are

1645
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,720
potentially potentially some of our

1646
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,640
non-functional requirements that just

1647
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,720
exist at a high level and then once

1648
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,359
they're noted down once they're part of

1649
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:19,760
that story

1650
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,839
right your your your overall

1651
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,920
understanding and context no you don't

1652
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,839
need them in every story

1653
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,440
so everything nests

1654
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,599
beneath those and therefore inherits

1655
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,119
from them yeah so you might have some of

1656
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,559
those things end up on your definition

1657
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,000
of done because because they're a

1658
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,799
quality issue

1659
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,680
and some of those things must might be

1660
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,520
on

1661
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:43,680
you can have an entry on your definition

1662
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:47,359
of done uh in the must must meet

1663
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,119
organizational graphic design standards

1664
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,640
right yeah so there you've just there

1665
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,480
might be a whole bunch of things that

1666
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,400
need to be true to do with icons and

1667
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,680
graphics and placement and order of

1668
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,200
buttons and

1669
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,799
uh you know if you're following what's

1670
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:04,000
the the new

1671
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:06,480
uh microsoft's new is it called flow

1672
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,520
fluid design they're the fluid design

1673
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,559
model

1674
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,480
right so all new products at microsoft

1675
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,760
regardless of what platform you're

1676
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,760
building where

1677
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,839
every new product of microsoft must meet

1678
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,720
the fluid design guidelines

1679
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,039
right

1680
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,280
do the old products meet it no

1681
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,280
but if they have to they they have to

1682
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,520
all have a plan on

1683
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,359
are they going to are they choosing to

1684
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,280
update it or not is that a retiring

1685
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:34,880
product that we're not going to fix or

1686
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,559
is it a product we're keeping moving

1687
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,440
forward which means then we need a plan

1688
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:42,079
to move to the fluid design

1689
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,000
yes right so that i mean the

1690
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,440
these are things that do need to be

1691
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,799
discussed they're business decisions

1692
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,760
they cost money

1693
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,440
um

1694
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,880
and there might be organizational

1695
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,200
standards and definitions that we have

1696
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,200
to meet

1697
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,000
so yes we have that conversation but we

1698
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,520
don't need to have it here because it's

1699
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,640
probably already been had sure yeah

1700
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,559
but

1701
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,000
deciding how long the tags are what

1702
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,720
happens if people input incorrect data

1703
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,480
that's all business decisions

1704
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:15,760
and i guess it gets more complicated

1705
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:18,240
when if you're building a data systems

1706
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,799
like you're analyzing data you might

1707
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,640
have to clean that data so knowing

1708
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:25,440
what's valid data and what's invalid

1709
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,680
data is a business decision

1710
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,680
it's not an engineering decision

1711
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,839
right the engineers might say here's a

1712
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:33,359
list of [Â __Â ] that we've got that we

1713
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:34,880
don't know what to do with

1714
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:36,319
business you need to make a decision on

1715
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,319
what we do with it and the business goes

1716
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,920
well delete that one uh that one's

1717
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,319
really supposed to be this so map it to

1718
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,680
this value this one's that okay and then

1719
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:46,319
you just go through that list and ask

1720
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,319
those questions

1721
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,920
[Music]

1722
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,640
so let's

1723
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:02,400
who is familiar with gherkin

1724
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:04,240
anybody

1725
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,920
david might be

1726
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,960
that's in the food or is this something

1727
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,960
else no not the food no no no

1728
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:17,679
so gherkin is uh a set of tooling

1729
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,040
which in the dot net world you might use

1730
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:22,239
spec flow

1731
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,799
um where it allows you to create

1732
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:27,839
executable specifications

1733
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:29,679
uh this might be a task where you turn

1734
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:32,880
these given when thens

1735
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:35,040
into unit tests and those unit tests

1736
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,719
validate whether you've met the the

1737
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,679
business requirements

1738
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:40,719
um

1739
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,640
they're they're very powerful tools you

1740
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:45,359
maybe don't want everything to go that

1741
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,120
way but it is certainly a a good option

1742
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,440
the more

1743
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,759
criteria that you have for acceptance

1744
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,159
criteria the more likely you are to want

1745
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,520
to to to have an

1746
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:58,239
you know what i mean by an executable

1747
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,239
specification

1748
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,640
no

1749
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,880
so

1750
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,440
are our

1751
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,159
oh can i i don't know if i could even

1752
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:10,880
add hawker a demo for you um but

1753
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:13,279
effectively you you would have three

1754
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,520
methods that are run a given method of

1755
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:18,640
when method and a then method

1756
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,400
um and the the system actually takes the

1757
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,520
text that you would enter in the

1758
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,000
acceptance

1759
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,000
criteria box in azure devops

1760
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,920
and converts it into code

1761
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,560
and then your engineers have to go fill

1762
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,679
in the code in between so for example if

1763
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,159
you're saying

1764
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,359
given a tag value of less than three

1765
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,759
characters

1766
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,600
right when it is entered

1767
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:42,319
then it is not saved and the user is

1768
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,759
alerted you can create a unit test for

1769
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,239
that

1770
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:49,199
you can create a test

1771
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:51,040
that tries to send the system a two

1772
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:52,400
character

1773
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,560
tag

1774
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,480
and it rejects it with the correct

1775
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,040
message so you can do something about it

1776
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,040
in the ui

1777
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,239
i see can you and can you generate those

1778
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,440
directly from the user story so you only

1779
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,400
effectively

1780
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,920
you know you create once used many times

1781
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:13,199
the the

1782
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:17,360
writing yes so let me

1783
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:19,760
i'm just going to share my moment

1784
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,760
that one

1785
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:23,520
oh awesome they've got a cookie monster

1786
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,520
on their page

1787
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,880
oh look at that they've even written

1788
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,960
their data privacy as a as a spec flow

1789
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,239
scenario

1790
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,360
right

1791
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:38,560
so given an unknown user access expect

1792
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:41,199
flow when this user accepts spec flow

1793
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,800
cookie by clicking accept all then splat

1794
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:46,159
4 will show the content based on the

1795
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,520
user's interest except all right

1796
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,159
so um

1797
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,719
this is a way for you to

1798
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:55,719
there's a there's a good example let's

1799
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,719
see

1800
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,120
right i'm not going to dive into that

1801
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,080
let's do the right

1802
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,679
so there's a a a bit of a spec flow

1803
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,679
right you have a feature which is a

1804
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,520
calculator

1805
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,840
let me zoom in for you

1806
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,840
there we go

1807
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,440
oh it's either really big or not really

1808
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,320
big

1809
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,159
um

1810
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,800
so the scenario

1811
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:24,960
add two numbers given i've entered 50

1812
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,840
into the calculator and i have entered

1813
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:31,199
70 when i press add then the result was

1814
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,600
120 on the screen right

1815
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:36,480
so that that

1816
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,360
that is a business problem a business

1817
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:43,360
statement is business readable

1818
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,920
and then that is turned into code

1819
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:48,480
that is basically a method

1820
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:51,120
um there'll be a method called

1821
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,400
uh given i have entered 50 into the

1822
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,159
calculator

1823
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,199
right they'll effectively be a method

1824
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,040
called that

1825
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,280
so the engineer will go fill in the

1826
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,560
content of the method to add 50 to the

1827
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,840
calculator

1828
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,239
right

1829
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,520
but if you have another scenario

1830
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,440
that uses

1831
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,280
i have entered 50 into the calculator

1832
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,640
it's going to use the same method so yes

1833
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:16,719
you can build up a library of

1834
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:18,719
this yeah of all of this um and it's a

1835
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:19,840
very very

1836
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,800
powerful

1837
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,120
um

1838
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,719
it's a very powerful tool um it

1839
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,000
interfaces with lots of different

1840
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:29,600
platforms

1841
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,280
uh so you can i mean the the the the

1842
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,520
you can set them up

1843
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,719
uh so there's libraries like fluid

1844
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,560
assertions

1845
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:40,000
uh that allow you to

1846
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,320
to to write those statements in code

1847
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,800
in an easy way i was just looking first

1848
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,360
for for examples uh

1849
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,120
maybe that's the intention

1850
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,120
uh there we go

1851
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,120
so um

1852
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,679
should start with

1853
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:59,280
actual so there's the string

1854
01:12:55,679 --> 01:13:03,440
should start with a b and end with high

1855
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:05,199
and contained ef and have length nine

1856
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,800
right there's an assertion that you can

1857
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,400
put in your

1858
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,239
uh um

1859
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,800
in your unit testing framework

1860
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:15,440
that is human readable

1861
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,760
right even if you're not an engineer

1862
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,960
you can you can parse that and see what

1863
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,760
it's doing

1864
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:25,120
um yeah and and and you could do that

1865
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,700
with with tags with other other tools

1866
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,000
um

1867
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:30,239
[Music]

1868
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,640
and there's just different examples of

1869
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,159
of how you would set that up

1870
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,280
so that it's easier for people to

1871
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:40,159
understand and then once you've got it i

1872
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,159
think there's a way

1873
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,040
there's different ways of doing it okay

1874
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,199
but if i go back to

1875
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:51,520
spec flow

1876
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,520
and

1877
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:57,280
i think spec flow runner is it just spec

1878
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,719
flow they have different

1879
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,360
tools

1880
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,040
but in the the spec flow runner

1881
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,400
it basically you can have it integrate

1882
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:09,199
with azure devops load the text

1883
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,600
out of the acceptance criteria and use

1884
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:13,520
that as as as the foundation for

1885
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,320
building unit tests

1886
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,199
sure yeah i understand yeah thank you

1887
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:21,280
um so that's that's a really good uh

1888
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:24,560
tool that is certainly

1889
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,440
more advanced right i don't think

1890
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,440
uh oh i've gone off the mural

1891
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,880
i don't think everybody's going to take

1892
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,320
advantage of that

1893
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,600
um

1894
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,679
but i think

1895
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,679
that's that is a powerful way to do it

1896
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:42,000
i've used it with a lot of teams

1897
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,600
is what i'm saying

1898
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,840
uh

1899
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,719
so i guess the question is uh what

1900
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:52,480
questions do you have now on

1901
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,480
user stories and scenarios

1902
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,640
i can i can

1903
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,679
give you a workshop

1904
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:04,400
that you can run with your teams okay

1905
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,159
um and it it's super super super easy

1906
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,960
i've run it with tons of organizations

1907
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:10,800
you effectively get them to draw on a on

1908
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,360
a whiteboard either virtual with mural

1909
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,760
or a physical whiteboard and a user

1910
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:18,400
interface that they have already created

1911
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,400
in the system

1912
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,880
and then create the user stories you

1913
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,600
would have and scenarios that you would

1914
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,120
have liked to have

1915
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,040
not what you did have but what you would

1916
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,640
have liked to have to build it because

1917
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,800
you know everything about the choices

1918
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,920
you made yeah

1919
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,239
not only do you know everything about

1920
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,800
the choices you made but you know

1921
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:40,560
that oh we tested that and it didn't

1922
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,000
didn't pass the tests because it didn't

1923
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,600
work like this so then we had to go

1924
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,360
change it again

1925
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,600
so what could we have had in our user

1926
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:50,080
story and acceptance criteria to not

1927
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,719
have to rework that

1928
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,800
functionality

1929
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,440
because that's waste right that's wasted

1930
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,719
time and effort and money

1931
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,480
how could we have had a short

1932
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,800
conversation that would have resulted in

1933
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:06,600
an answer that allowed us to to build it

1934
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,600
the right way the first time

1935
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,000
and build out all of the user stories or

1936
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,159
as many as you can for that ui breaking

1937
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,560
them down and i usually when i'm working

1938
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:18,960
with teams you get together everybody

1939
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,159
who cares right so you could have the

1940
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,400
the scrum team so so developers plus

1941
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:26,239
product owner plus scrum master and but

1942
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,320
you might also invite subject matter

1943
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,320
experts uh maybe you have other people

1944
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,320
in product management that matter maybe

1945
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,840
you have not users but maybe key

1946
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,000
stakeholders that you can bring into

1947
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,080
that conversation and just

1948
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,800
see what it takes to break down and

1949
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,040
create user stories in a format

1950
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,320
that helps everybody understand

1951
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,120
that feature

1952
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,719
right

1953
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,080
and this is so something you've built

1954
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,480
before that make sense

1955
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,480
so you can use hindsight

1956
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,560
and then the second part of the exercise

1957
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,480
that can take like you can spend two

1958
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,360
hours doing that easy

1959
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,360
okay

1960
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,199
and then the second part of the exercise

1961
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,239
is take something off your backlog and

1962
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,239
do the same thing with it

1963
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,280
so now you're not working with hindsight

1964
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,120
you're thinking about the future but now

1965
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:15,600
you're thinking about the level of

1966
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,760
detail that you need

1967
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,600
to not build things wrong

1968
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,920
and have to rework it because rework is

1969
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,880
hugely expensive you've got the engineer

1970
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,800
had to build it then you had to test it

1971
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,960
it wasn't right so then you had to

1972
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,760
rebuild it and then you had to retest it

1973
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,679
that's twice as much work isn't it

1974
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,239
yeah

1975
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,239
i'd rather do it once right what's the

1976
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,280
what's the what's the expression for

1977
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:41,600
joiners

1978
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,199
uh measure twice

1979
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:47,920
and cut once at once yep

1980
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,600
so agile is not about just making it up

1981
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,719
as you go along and then changing it

1982
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,640
later

1983
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,520
you still need to minimize waste because

1984
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,520
everything has a cost

1985
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,400
there's a cost like that i think

1986
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,719
david you were you were concerned about

1987
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,120
about how how much detail should you go

1988
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,199
into right

1989
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,600
that has a cost the more time you spend

1990
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,520
up front has a cost

1991
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,679
but you want to minimize you want to

1992
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,360
spend enough time up front that you

1993
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,480
minimize

1994
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,840
the amount of rework that you have to do

1995
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,400
yes

1996
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,320
and that that exercise that i'm talking

1997
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,800
about where you do it once with a ui

1998
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,640
that already exists with hindsight we

1999
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,040
all worked on that system we know what

2000
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,600
questions had to be answered after and

2001
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:35,199
even you might find that you'd built it

2002
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,320
put it in front of stakeholders and

2003
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,440
they're like no that's not what we

2004
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,040
thought it was and then you have to

2005
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,360
change it again

2006
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,239
right what could you have asked up front

2007
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,760
to not have to make those changes

2008
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:50,120
you're not going to know everything but

2009
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,120
we need to minimize that rework

2010
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,960
was this what you were expecting me to

2011
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,960
talk about

2012
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,080
yeah i think so yeah okay

2013
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,520
yeah it's been a very quite insightful

2014
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,880
it is it's um

2015
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,760
it's one of these things that sort of

2016
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,719
you

2017
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,800
you do approach anyway but see it's

2018
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:19,280
structured and put more formally it's

2019
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,040
really useful really eye opening to

2020
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:23,120
that's definitely something you'd use

2021
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,800
going forwards

2022
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,960
but they're not as a part of a larger

2023
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,560
methodology it's just

2024
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,719
yeah it just makes you really think

2025
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,400
about and really separate out

2026
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,199
different like different user stories

2027
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:38,320
different journeys it's

2028
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:42,000
yeah it's really valuable so i i i i

2029
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,280
have a uh a one day agile requirements

2030
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,080
workshop

2031
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,320
that covers this in in more depth right

2032
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,560
we can only do so much in in 90 90

2033
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,080
minutes plus there's only there's only

2034
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,199
four of you here so that's you know i'm

2035
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,199
gonna

2036
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,960
do that as well but if

2037
01:19:55,199 --> 01:20:00,400
ultimately the the agile requirements

2038
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,120
workshop and the two main exercises in

2039
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,320
there are the the the

2040
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,080
hindsight and not hindsight exercise and

2041
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,840
then there's just some discussion about

2042
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,239
these things around it

2043
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:15,040
so that they have a a frame of reference

2044
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:16,880
for building user stories and then as

2045
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,600
they're building them out especially the

2046
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,520
first time um i go around and

2047
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,239
poke at bad user stories

2048
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,159
like as a user right i think you can do

2049
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,679
better than that or

2050
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,239
that you know you've got a user story

2051
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,120
and you end up with 20 scenarios and

2052
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:32,560
you're like

2053
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,440
guys i think you should break that down

2054
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,560
that seems like a very big thing

2055
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,840
yeah yeah so so those those are

2056
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,920
that that

2057
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,840
what you end up with

2058
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,000
that level of detail

2059
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,679
that you as a team so i'm not going to

2060
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,679
tell you what level of detail you need

2061
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:51,520
because it's very specific to you your

2062
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:54,639
team your organization and your your

2063
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:57,199
subject matter matter um so that

2064
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,960
exercise the first part brings it down

2065
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:01,120
to here's the level of detail we would

2066
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,600
have liked to have to build to minimize

2067
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,600
our costs

2068
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,920
and then you look at your backlog and go

2069
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,280
oh

2070
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,400
you know we don't have that level of

2071
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,800
detail

2072
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,400
we have too many open-ended questions

2073
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,920
maybe this is not ready maybe we need to

2074
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:19,120
spend more time in refinement maybe we

2075
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,560
need to ask some of those questions

2076
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,600
because as you as you found it's really

2077
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:26,480
hard to get to some of those questions

2078
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,440
yeah right you gotta that's why a a

2079
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,760
picture

2080
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,719
really really helps how how are you

2081
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,480
visualizing

2082
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,440
what it is that you're you're you're

2083
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,360
building

2084
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,679
right should should those that table be

2085
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,639
able to be ordered or not

2086
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:45,280
right if it's ingredients maybe not

2087
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,880
maybe it shouldn't be ordered

2088
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:49,679
right because you want them to be in a

2089
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,800
specific order

2090
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,760
yeah yeah

2091
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,760
yeah yeah it's it's super

2092
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,480
there's lots of conversations you could

2093
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:02,480
have and in fact i don't like that ui i

2094
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,239
want a different one

2095
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,760
right might be the first conversation

2096
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,440
you have and actually i don't like that

2097
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,920
ui

2098
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:13,440
i want the cooking notes and the recipe

2099
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:13,440
ingredients to be integrated

2100
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,040
right because you follow a set of step

2101
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,719
you need to know what you need to have

2102
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,000
up front and then you follow the set of

2103
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,159
steps but i don't want stuff twice

2104
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,760
so how do i integrate the two yeah yeah

2105
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,120
i i get really complicated with these

2106
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,719
things for sure

2107
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,400
but your your product owner has the

2108
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,679
option to sit there and say

2109
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,719
we don't need to go in like i did yeah

2110
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,639
we don't need to worry about that just

2111
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,320
now all right let's we'll think about

2112
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,320
that later that's for a future future

2113
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,639
story let's just focus on this

2114
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,120
but did you notice how hard it was for

2115
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:48,400
me to keep that focus

2116
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:50,239
yeah yeah so your product owner

2117
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,000
one of their jobs

2118
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,600
is to help the team understand what they

2119
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,600
need to build which means during

2120
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,360
refinement they have to keep that focus

2121
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,280
no this is the context that we're

2122
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,360
talking about

2123
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,960
and as soon as the team strays outside

2124
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,719
of that context

2125
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:06,400
right yes

2126
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,000
let's put a note for later

2127
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,080
but this is what we're talking about

2128
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,600
just now because you can get into a lot

2129
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,840
of tangents

2130
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,440
right well i think that was your worry

2131
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,560
wasn't it uh

2132
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,400
mcsee

2133
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,239
um was was

2134
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,960
get getting getting too far into the

2135
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:26,480
weeds and not focusing on what what it

2136
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,480
is we actually need to build just now

2137
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,880
yeah i think

2138
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,639
uh this is no reflection of my

2139
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,860
colleagues but i can see a scenario

2140
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,000
where people start to become

2141
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:37,280
[Music]

2142
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,440
um

2143
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,440
risk-averse and combative and i think if

2144
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,520
i haven't listed it this may be my one

2145
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,600
opportunity to get it and if i don't

2146
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,199
list it it gives them latitude and they

2147
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,360
may go off and do something that i don't

2148
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:51,679
want but then you

2149
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:53,520
you ultimately the whole effort is

2150
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,560
doesn't achieve its maximum potential

2151
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,960
because you spent

2152
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,880
filling out forms yes but that will only

2153
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,120
happen once

2154
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,880
right or or a limited number of times

2155
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,600
because

2156
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,000
you you i i'm gonna want

2157
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,800
your team to have that conversation if

2158
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,159
you had to do that right if the if you

2159
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,920
get to the sprint review and the

2160
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:16,800
customer's like what is this bollocks

2161
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,719
that's not what i asked for right yeah

2162
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:21,280
that's the first conversation you're

2163
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,639
having at your retrospective

2164
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:25,120
how how

2165
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,199
why were we so far off what the customer

2166
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,880
wanted well they wanted this and they

2167
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:31,760
wanted that and the other thing and they

2168
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,080
didn't tell us that it's like well okay

2169
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,199
why didn't they tell us that did we not

2170
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,360
ask

2171
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:39,360
what could we have asked

2172
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,600
to find out that information

2173
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,199
right yeah so your trip your trip that

2174
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,400
that

2175
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:48,960
the the the questioning

2176
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,199
that a team needs to be able to do to

2177
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,120
interact with customers and stakeholders

2178
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:55,840
and find out what they need to help the

2179
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,840
product owner build that better backlog

2180
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,840
is a skill that you need to learn

2181
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:06,320
so yeah how do we

2182
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,080
figure that out

2183
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,840
so i'm saying that

2184
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,679
the problems i've got to go shortly but

2185
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:14,000
there's as you move forward through time

2186
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,840
this becomes not just easier but also

2187
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,840
better because you develop that ability

2188
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,320
and experience of what questions to ask

2189
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,600
so you don't repeat the mistakes of the

2190
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:26,080
past but also presumably you build up a

2191
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,520
set of fairly generic use cases you

2192
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,760
build up a library of use cases you

2193
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,280
reuse so you know i'm building one of

2194
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,239
these it's very similar to that thing we

2195
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,239
did two years ago let me just pull in

2196
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:39,920
80 of the use cases which gives you that

2197
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:43,280
head start yeah well and do do you have

2198
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:44,880
uh um documents that are our standards

2199
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,440
of the way things

2200
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,600
should work in your organization right

2201
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,040
you you should definitely have those you

2202
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:55,199
should have a ux guidelines document

2203
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,840
that may be a wiki that you constantly

2204
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:59,679
update right you should have a

2205
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,120
definition of done

2206
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:03,920
and what is what is this particular

2207
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,600
what's our our coding guidelines

2208
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,000
right what's the level of quality that

2209
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,080
we expect in the naming convention for

2210
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,480
our methods in the

2211
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,320
uh length of our methods what are what

2212
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,080
are our rules that we have as an

2213
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,760
organization around that so that we have

2214
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,960
readable supportable maintainable

2215
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,639
products and that fits within our brand

2216
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,280
fits within

2217
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:26,960
our organizational expectation because

2218
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,880
users

2219
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,000
you don't actually want to build stuff

2220
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:35,120
out with the expectation of users right

2221
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,280
so you might have some cool innovative

2222
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,360
way of solving a problem that a

2223
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:41,280
developer's like oh that's cool i'll try

2224
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,560
and you know i want to try and implement

2225
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,840
it that way because i think it will be

2226
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:47,199
cool

2227
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:50,719
right but if it creates

2228
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:53,040
a difficulty for users a friction for

2229
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:56,560
users using it because everything else

2230
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:59,679
in your system works click click slide

2231
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,320
and this new feature works

2232
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,440
at click click slide slide click

2233
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,480
then

2234
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,679
you've got a discrepancy in usage and is

2235
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,000
that's not within the bounds of your

2236
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:14,400
expectation your users expectations

2237
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,639
so so once you've decided what those ux

2238
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:19,360
ui and ux guidelines are although you're

2239
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,520
going to iterate on them over time you

2240
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:25,360
will need to quantify them

2241
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:27,840
uh ux guidelines ui guidelines coding

2242
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,239
standards right these should all be

2243
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,920
documented clearly for everybody in your

2244
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:34,719
organization and part of every team's

2245
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,719
definition i've done

2246
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,960
just to make you feel bad about your

2247
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,199
definition of done if it doesn't have

01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,199
that

2249
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:46,480

01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,560
useful

2256
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,639
yeah

2257
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,080
um i didn't run all of the exercises

2258
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,840
that i wanted to just because we didn't

2259
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,920
have the people to run it so

2260
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,080
um it was it was better just to talk

2261
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,760
about stuff

2262
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,120
i feel like there's sort of a few less

2263
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,400
people in the class as well because you

2264
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,639
can sort of

2265
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,960
talk more directly and it's less lost in

2266
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:19,600
the crowds yeah i i agree both are

2267
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:22,080
valuable both are valuable
