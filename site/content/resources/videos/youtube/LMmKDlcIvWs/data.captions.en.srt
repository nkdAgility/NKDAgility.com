1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,720
what is

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:06,960
caman there

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,559
are lots of different definitions of

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,559
caman and there are lots of

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,240
misunderstandings about what cban

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,199
is and it's at its

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:25,039
core um caman is a

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,160
strategy not an actual system of

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,920
delivering stuff so that's that's what

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,240
one of the common misunderstandings of

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,920
cban is that it's a system of delivering

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,960
stuff it's not it's a strategy to help

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,079
you understand your existing system of

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,079
delivering

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,039
stuff and help you optimize that system

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,399
of delivering stuff so quite often I'll

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,680
I'll sometimes describe it as a meta

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,280
process right it's a process that lets

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,239
you monitor a process which just messes

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:01,160
with people's heads but effectively um

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:05,080
canman brings the the the the the some

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,640
rigor and some metrics and some analysis

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,720
of those

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,720
metrics to allow you or your team or

25
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,720
your

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,280
organization to look at any system and

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,159
what's happening in that

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,479
system and um adapt it in a good way

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
right so you can see when we make a

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,560
change to the system how does that

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,920
affect the data how does that affect the

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,880
flow of work through that system and if

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,079
you've made a positive impact you keep

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,880
doing that thing and if you've made a

35
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,560
negative impact you you stop doing that

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,960
thing right go back to the old way so um

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,240
you could also say that caman is a work

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,280
limited pool system but that's a little

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,119
bit nobody understands that terminology

40
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,719
the easiest way to describe it is it's a

41
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,399
way of looking at your existing system

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,439
and helping you as an individual ask

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,240
more interesting question

44
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:08,200
questions about how that system goes

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,000
together in order to have a more optimal

46
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,040
system to have work full through your

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,400
system more effectively right so caman

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,879
uh a cban strategy can be

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,519
applied to any system doesn't matter

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,319
what the system is if the stuff going

51
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,800
through a system uh whether that is um a

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,720
checkout at supermarket right that's a

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,800
system with stuff flowing through it or

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,159
um your engineering team and you've got

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,159
work flowing through it or your creative

56
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,840
team and you've got work flowing through

57
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,640
it it doesn't matter what your system is

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,840
cban brings that caman strategy that you

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,599
apply brings a little bit of rigor to

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,680
that system and some metrics that allow

61
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,280
you to monitor that system uh so for

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,319
example one one of one of the key things

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,200
that happens at the beginning of any

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,640
cand discussion is that you you you

65
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,200
create what cbang calls a definition of

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,440
workflow right all that means is you

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,840
write down how you work that's it that's

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,000
all the definition of workflow is you

69
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,200
you you've got your way of working for a

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,760
particular thing that you do it could be

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,319
a team with work going through it it

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,239
could be a a a machine that processes

73
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,840
something it could be

74
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,680
a check out a supermarket right and you

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,200
write down the way everything works in

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,400
that system cuz what what a lot of

77
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,439
people even just the act of doing that

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
can create optimizations in the system

79
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,680
um

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,360
because if you've got five people

81
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,920
working in a system and you've never

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,319
written down how that system

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,799
works what do you think the chances are

84
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,079
that everybody working in that system

85
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,760
uses the same terminology makes the same

86
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,040
same or similar decisions applies the

87
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,560
same rules to playing the game H yeah

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,120
that's a great example actually I like

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,759
that one as well so if you if you went

90
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560
out and and and bought Monopoly I'm not

91
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,639
suggesting it by the way there are way

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,320
better games than that but if you did

93
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
buy because it's the most common thing

94
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,919
right you can find it in every Super

95
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,919
Market if you went out and bought

96
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,240
Monopoly and you

97
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,919
immediately tore up the rule

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,080
book and you just guessed how to play

99
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,400
the game and you had four people playing

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,840
the game and everybody just guessed

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,840
based based and Monopoly is a good one

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,520
because everybody knows how Monopoly

103
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,479
kind of works right everybody knows how

104
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
monoply kind of

105
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,479
works would would everybody be playing

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
the same game would everybody be playing

107
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,000
by the same rules would everybody have

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,840
the same understanding of the mechanisms

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,479
of the game and how it's How how it

110
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
actually works no they wouldn't right

111
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,880
they would they would each come up with

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,560
their own way of doing it and if you've

113
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,400
ever been at one of those family dues

114
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,160
where you've got Monopoly out you argue

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,000
over how the rules work you argue as a

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,680
group as a family about how you should

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,080
play the game because you're not you've

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,560
not agreed as a group how to play it

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,919
right that's that's what the rule book

120
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,199
that comes with a game is it's here's

121
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,680
the way you play the game so what what's

122
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,560
where's the rule book for your team for

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,240
the way your team Works where's the rule

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,680
book when a new team member comes in do

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,560
they also just make up how they work and

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,520
then you tell them when they're doing it

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,400
wrong and hopefully they end up figuring

128
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,800
out how to do it right doesn't make any

129
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,360
sense you write it down so what that

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,840
typically what that typically looks like

131
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,319
we we've all see what what what a lot of

132
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,160
people do is they draw a board on the

133
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:05,400
wall right or or in jir or in Azure

134
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,720
devops and it has a bunch of columns and

135
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,800
they call that

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,319
cat that's not a cand strategy that's

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
just a board right anybody can have a

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,440
board and have work flow through the

139
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,960
board part of the campan is deciding

140
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
agreeing what that work what that what

141
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,800
that workflow

142
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,000
is right and once you've agreed what

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,680
that workflow is you can and then um

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,280
apply some metrics and monitor what's

145
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,160
going on in that

146
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,800
workflow right and once you're

147
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
monitoring what's going on in that

148
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,160
workflow right just looking at the data

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,400
is not enough empiricism remember right

150
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,360
you have to actively manage the work

151
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,520
that's going through the system so you

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,479
actively make choices about what is

153
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,680
happening within the system in order to

154
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,120
to to to optimize the outcome

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,000
and then you're going to look at the

156
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,840
data to improve the system right so you

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,039
look at the data and then you actively

158
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,960
make changes to the workflow so you've

159
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,160
written down how you think you work

160
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
right now right that's where you start

161
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,960
that's why they there's an expression

162
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,599
they use in camman which is start start

163
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,520
from where you are right that's that's

164
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
the expression so where you are is what

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
you do right now so write down what you

166
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,160
do right

167
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,720
now that's your current definition of

168
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,879
workflow you build the board you

169
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,800
visualize your work in process your work

170
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,599
that's going on and then you start using

171
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,879
it and you're like oh crap we didn't

172
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,919
think about this oh oh oh oh that

173
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,960
doesn't quite work like that so you

174
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,120
start making changes so that it more

175
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,039
accurately reflects your definition of

176
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
workflow and then because you're

177
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,360
visualizing your work you start noticing

178
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,680
things humans are really good at visual

179
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,400
uh uh um seeing when things aren't quite

180
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
right or the way you think they should

181
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,800
be and then you can go look at the data

182
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,039
and go no no no no we should actually

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,759
change this we shouldn't have two

184
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:07,080
columns we should have one or we

185
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,240
shouldn't have one column we should have

186
