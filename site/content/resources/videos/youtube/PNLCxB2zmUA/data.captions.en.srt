1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,480
as you change the demands you're putting

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,000
on the product you're going to have to

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,839
change the architecture of the product

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,880
in order to support the new demands that

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,799
you're putting on it so investing in uh

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,840
the the the time and effort for the

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,880
teams to be able to work towards those

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,080
outcomes and we're not talking about

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,359
we're not going to deliver any new

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,160
features because we're trying to do this

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,599
we're talking about enabling them to do

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,080
a little piece at a time um the the the

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,519
the Azure devops team had uh some

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,720
architectural changes they needed to

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,360
make in their test infrastructure in

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,200
order to reduce their time to Market and

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,800
to completely clear off the old test

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,480
infrastructure took four years right

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,120
we're not talking about shorter time

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,039
frames we're talking about long-term

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,039
products that exist in the market
