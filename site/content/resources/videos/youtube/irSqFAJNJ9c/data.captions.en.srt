1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,179
the the hypothetical question

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,320
was what does a poor scrum team look

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,420
like

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,140
and unfortunately that's how well it

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,900
depends answer as well right because

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,240
it's not it's not the things the team

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,000
well there are some things that I would

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,340
almost always categorically put in the

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,600
not good category but sometimes most of

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,780
the time it's the

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,500
the outcomes

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,200
that are bad so for example a poor scrum

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,579
team might be

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,739
um you've got some lead developer who's

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,500
always imposing their will on everybody

16
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,120
else in the team doesn't listen to what

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,559
everybody else says and expects

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,699
everybody to just do what he tells them

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
to do

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,780
there's there's a there's that and I

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,900
would just say that's just not a team

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,500
right does not necessarily need the

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:15,000
scrum part it's just not a team

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,159
um or my favorite favorite example of a

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,960
dysfunctional scrum behavior that I use

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,119
a lot is actually the a dysfunctional

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,880
product owner

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,799
um and during a Sprint review

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,740
the customer is a little bit the

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,060
stakeholders are a little bit irate

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,280
because they didn't get something they

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,880
the way they want it

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,820
and they demanded of the the scrum team

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,280
why did you build it that way

35
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,780
and what you would expect to see in a

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,720
healthy scrum team

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,680
is that the product owner would be then

38
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,799
standing in front of the stakeholders

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,799
um

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,520
defending or apologizing for whatever

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,460
the problem was

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,320
and asking how would you like it to be

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,579
different how what could we do

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,280
differently in order to be able to

45
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,600
support what you need right or we're not

46
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,979
going to do it that way because that's

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,619
not the direction of the product but

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,260
it's the product owners

49
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:15,060
responsibility to to to make that stand

50
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,220
but that's not what happened in the case

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,540
that I'm thinking of the product owner

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,180
turned to the development team and said

53
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,580
yeah why did you build it that way

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,620
basically totally passing passing the

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,900
buck to the development team

56
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,720
and saying it's your fault that you

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,819
didn't understand what the customer said

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,500
and I translated for you

59
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,940
and you didn't build it the way I said

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,459
that's just

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,560
what what the hell right

62
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,780
that

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,800
that's not there's no trust there

64
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,379
there's no respect there there's no

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
commitment there there's no openness

66
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,560
there

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,500
pretty much totally divested of the

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
scrum values

69
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,840
and they weren't doing very good scrum

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,180
either

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,480
so I think there's a myriad of examples

72
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,160
of what what does a bad scrum team look

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,019
like and there's actually very few

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,920
examples of what does a good scrum team

75
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,920
look like because

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,720
there Patrick lisione one of the things

77
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,159
that that he said is that that great

78
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,500
teams

79
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,620
are such a

80
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,680
Force multiplier for companies

81
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,480
because they're so rare right it's

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,300
actually really hard to create great

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,099
teams because most organizations set you

84
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,980
up for failure

85
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,260
the the the the the

86
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,920
a policy be used used to have in in

87
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:44,819
Microsoft years ago under Steve Baumer

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,280
was that every manager had to stack rank

89
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,599
every one of their direct reports every

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,239
year

91
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,519
and at the end of that year based on the

92
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,959
stack rank the bottom 10 were out of the

93
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,659
team

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,819
if you were out of the team out of out

95
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,120
of a team three times in a row you wrote

96
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,120
the company

97
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,060
so what's the incentive for people to

98
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,739
work together

99
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,500
right isn't that an incentive for them

100
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,720
to try and stab each other in the back

101
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,099
what was the incentive for for you as a

102
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,680
as a leader

103
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,780
to build a great team

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,660
well I can't build a great team because

105
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,759
I'm going to lose 10 every year so I

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,660
need mostly a great team and some cannon

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,340
fodder that are going to get lost right

108
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,440
and how does that make the cannon father

109
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,220
feel or the rest of the people in the

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,340
team feel it just totally depresses the

111
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,440
ability for the organization to create

112
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,080
value

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,300
because

114
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,479
mediocre teams or bad teams don't build

115
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,639
great products amazing teams build

116
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,960
amazing products great teams built great

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,720
products

118
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,080
so you need to have an environment

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,120
within which teams are able to to be

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,100
like that and that that's not about

121
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,800
imposing

122
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
processes and tools on them even even

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,120
scrum you don't impose it on a team they

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,000
need to choose it

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
um it means not focusing on everybody

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,759
have the most comprehensive

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,400
documentation ever right you need that's

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,340
not going to help and you need to not

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,259
focus on on on contracts contracts don't

130
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,940
solve your problems contracts are just

131
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:28,259
working agreements

132
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,300
right they're a working agreement

133
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,740
between two companies so they don't deal

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,720
each other over so that they have an

135
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,539
agreement on how we're going to work

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,180
and as soon as you start enshrining ways

137
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,699
of working like ways of people working

138
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,199
what you're going to deliver how you're

139
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,720
going to deliver in the contract you're

140
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,880
starting to constrain the ability for

141
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,560
the teams to choose a way of working

142
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,300
that best suits

143
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,740
what they discover when they're doing

144
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,759
the work

145
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,759
so I think

146
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:01,759
it's easy to see how organizations

147
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,759
fail

148
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,460
to deliver value because they're not

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,520
actually focused on value they're

150
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,199
they're focused on treating uh these

151
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,660
teams that are meant to be generating

152
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,860
value as a cost center rather than a

153
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,580
Value Center

154
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,419
and that's what results in in poor

155
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,500
quality teams in unhappy people and

156
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,500
shitty products
