# What does a poor scrum team look, act and feel like?

Since it's inception in 1995, #scrum has proven itself to be one of the most resilient, valuable #agileframeworks in the #agile world. Time and again, #scrumteams have proven that they are capable of delivering great work in rapid cycles known as #sprints.

This has led to widespread adoption of the #scrumframework and given hope to #leadership and #executive teams that have been struggling with #productdevelopment in complex environments.

The problem is that #scrum is easy to understand, yet incredibly difficult to master, so we don't always see a massive increase in productivity, effectiveness, and #agile capability despite so many organizations turning to #scrum.

So, what does a poor team look like? How do you know whether you are actually going backwards, rather than improving, because the team are not leveraging the full power of the #scrumframework?

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the circumstances and scenarios that lead to poor performances in the #scrumteam.
