the hypothetical question was what does a poor scrum team look like and unfortunately that's how well it depends answer as well right because it's not it's not the things the team well there are some things that I would almost always categorically put in the not good category but sometimes most of the time it's the the outcomes that are bad so for example a poor scrum team might be um you've got some lead developer who's always imposing their will on everybody else in the team doesn't listen to what everybody else says and expects everybody to just do what he tells them to do there's there's a there's that and I would just say that's just not a team right does not necessarily need the scrum part it's just not a team um or my favorite favorite example of a dysfunctional scrum behavior that I use a lot is actually the a dysfunctional product owner um and during a Sprint review the customer is a little bit the stakeholders are a little bit irate because they didn't get something they the way they want it and they demanded of the the scrum team why did you build it that way and what you would expect to see in a healthy scrum team is that the product owner would be then standing in front of the stakeholders um defending or apologizing for whatever the problem was and asking how would you like it to be different how what could we do differently in order to be able to support what you need right or we're not going to do it that way because that's not the direction of the product but it's the product owners responsibility to to to make that stand but that's not what happened in the case that I'm thinking of the product owner turned to the development team and said yeah why did you build it that way basically totally passing passing the buck to the development team and saying it's your fault that you didn't understand what the customer said and I translated for you and you didn't build it the way I said that's just what what the hell right that that's not there's no trust there there's no respect there there's no commitment there there's no openness there pretty much totally divested of the scrum values and they weren't doing very good scrum either so I think there's a myriad of examples of what what does a bad scrum team look like and there's actually very few examples of what does a good scrum team look like because there Patrick lisione one of the things that that he said is that that great teams are such a Force multiplier for companies because they're so rare right it's actually really hard to create great teams because most organizations set you up for failure the the the the a policy be used used to have in in Microsoft years ago under Steve Baumer was that every manager had to stack rank every one of their direct reports every year and at the end of that year based on the stack rank the bottom 10 were out of the team if you were out of the team out of out of a team three times in a row you wrote the company so what's the incentive for people to work together right isn't that an incentive for them to try and stab each other in the back what was the incentive for for you as a as a leader to build a great team well I can't build a great team because I'm going to lose 10 every year so I need mostly a great team and some cannon fodder that are going to get lost right and how does that make the cannon father feel or the rest of the people in the team feel it just totally depresses the ability for the organization to create value because mediocre teams or bad teams don't build great products amazing teams build amazing products great teams built great products so you need to have an environment within which teams are able to to be like that and that that's not about imposing processes and tools on them even even scrum you don't impose it on a team they need to choose it um it means not focusing on everybody have the most comprehensive documentation ever right you need that's not going to help and you need to not focus on on on contracts contracts don't solve your problems contracts are just working agreements right they're a working agreement between two companies so they don't deal each other over so that they have an agreement on how we're going to work and as soon as you start enshrining ways of working like ways of people working what you're going to deliver how you're going to deliver in the contract you're starting to constrain the ability for the teams to choose a way of working that best suits what they discover when they're doing the work so I think it's easy to see how organizations fail to deliver value because they're not actually focused on value they're they're focused on treating uh these teams that are meant to be generating value as a cost center rather than a Value Center and that's what results in in poor quality teams in unhappy people and shitty products
