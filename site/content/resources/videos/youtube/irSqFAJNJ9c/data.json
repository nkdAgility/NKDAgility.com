    "description": "Since it's inception in 1995, #scrum has proven itself to be one of the most resilient, valuable #agileframeworks in the #agile world. Time and again, #scrumteams have proven that they are capable of delivering great work in rapid cycles known as #sprints.\n\nThis has led to widespread adoption of the #scrumframework and given hope to #leadership and #executive teams that have been struggling with #productdevelopment in complex environments.\n\nThe problem is that #scrum is easy to understand, yet incredibly difficult to master, so we don't always see a massive increase in productivity, effectiveness, and #agile capability despite so many organizations turning to #scrum.\n\nSo, what does a poor team look like? How do you know whether you are actually going backwards, rather than improving, because the team are not leveraging the full power of the #scrumframework?\n\nIn this short video, Martin Hinshelwood walks us through the circumstances and scenarios that lead to poor performances in the #scrumteam.\n\nAbout NKD Agility\n\nNaked Agility is an #agile consultancy that specializes in #scrumtraining, #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting to help teams evolve, integrate, and continuously improve. \n\nWe recognize the positive impact that a happy AND inspired workforce can have on customer experience, and we actively help organizations to tap into the power of creative, collaborative, and high-performing teams that is unique to #agile and #scrum environments. \n\nIf you are interested in #agiletraining, visit https://nkdagility.com/training/ \n\nIf you have identified the need for #agilecoaching and #agileconsulting, visit https://nkdagility.com/agile-consulting-coaching/ \n\nWe would love to work with you. \n\n#scrum #agile #scrumteam #agileprojectmanagement #agileproductdevelopment #projectmanagement #productdevelopment #agilecoach #agileconsultant #agiletraining #scrumtraining #scrumorg",
