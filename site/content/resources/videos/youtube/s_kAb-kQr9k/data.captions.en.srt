you can't lead innovation if you're

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,080
that's exactly where a lot of CTOs find

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,560
reacting to everything isn't leadership

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,960
at Naked Agility we help CTO's step back

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
sustainable tech leadership that starts

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,640
decision making that's deliberate not

20
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,480
reactive because staying competitive

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
doesn't mean doing more it means doing

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,239
what matters with focus on consistency

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,719
