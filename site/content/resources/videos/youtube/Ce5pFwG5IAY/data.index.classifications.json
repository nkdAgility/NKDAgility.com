It does not mention, describe, or allude to the Definition of Workflow as per Kanban or related contexts. There is no discussion of workflow agreements, entry/exit criteria, WIP limits, or process transparency. While it is targeted at Agile/Scrum practitioners, the subject is limited to meeting facilitation, not workflow policies or improvement. No outdated or negative framing is present, so no penalties are applied. Scores are very low across all dimensions, reflecting only a minimal incidental overlap in Agile context and intended audience.",

The focus is entirely on improving human team interactions using facilitation tools.
