Scrum Masters love liberating structures. Liberating structures are 33 different little constructs that you can use in your meetings, in your events, to make them more eventful, to make them more powerful, to make them have more purpose. You don't just use them willy-nilly. You have a plan, right? What is it you're trying to achieve with your event that you're running with a team or with a group of people? And then building strings of liberating structures that allow you to get from the ideas that people have to the outcome that you're trying to achieve. Liberating structures.
