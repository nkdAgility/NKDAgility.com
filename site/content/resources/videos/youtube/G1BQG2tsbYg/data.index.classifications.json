    "reasoning": "The content focuses entirely on predictability, agile principles, and business alignment. Although it references 'goals', 'objectives', and 'aligning business goals', it does not mention OKRs, Objective Key Results, John Doerr, or outcome-vs-output concepts explicit to OKRs. There are no discussions of OKR frameworks, key results as measurable outcomes, their use in Scrum/Agile, or common OKR anti-patterns. The alignment to the OKR category is extremely weak, resting only on generic goal/alignment language. No penalties applied as there is no outdatedness or contradictory tone.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content discusses achieving predictability through agile principles and business alignment but does not reference OKRs, Objective Key Results, or their foundational concepts. Its relevance to Objective Key Results is marginal and indirect, mainly via general goal-setting and alignment language.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on how Agile principles enhance predictability by optimizing systems, encouraging empowerment, adaptability, tailored frameworks, and feedback loops. These ideas tangentially touch on developer agency and feedback-driven adaptation, but there is little explicit or in-depth discussion of maximizing human or AI agency, ethical AI, or deliberate agentic engineering philosophy. The content targets organizational leaders and agile practitioners, aligning somewhat with the intended audience, but remains at a pragmatic, business-process level without thoroughly exploring agentic engineering concepts, decision-making frameworks, or AI collaboration. No penalties were necessary as the tone is neutral and current.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content adopts Agile to drive predictability and business alignment, touching lightly on empowerment and feedback loops. However, it lacks explicit focus on agentic engineering principles—such as maximizing human/AI agency or ethical autonomy—limiting its alignment to the category.",

While it discusses optimizing systems, feedback loops, and adaptability, it makes no explicit mention of autonomous AI agents, agentic design, or integrating contextual intelligence into delivery processes. The main themes align with classic Agile consulting for business predictability via team empowerment and custom frameworks, not the embedding or governance of AI agents. Even discussion of tooling, telemetry, or automation is absent. The audience (business or technical leadership interested in Agile) somewhat overlaps, but the subject matter misses the central ideas that define Agentic Software Delivery.",
