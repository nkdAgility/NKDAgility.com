1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,279
businesses want

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,840
predictability predictability enables

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,200
them um to to focus on achieving the

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,880
outcomes that they desire in a

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
consistent way it reduces uncertainty

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,880
and helps them achieve their business

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,439
goals but

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,680
predictability is hard to

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:27,279
achieve um it it there are all sorts of

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,080
things that kind of get in the way of us

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,559
having predictability as a business now

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,760
the things that we can't avoid that get

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,960
in the way of predictability are things

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,879
like um Market volatility right the the

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,760
changes in the market the unpredictable

16
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,360
nature of the world and the ecosystem in

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,920
which we're in

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:52,000
are things we cannot control right so so

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,520
we have to um include that in our

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
story but there are a bunch of things

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,120
where we get

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,840
unpredictability that we can control

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,519
that we can do something about so having

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
having clear goals um or unclear goals

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,240
right causing unpredictability

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
operational

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
inefficiencies uh creating

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,920
unpredictability you don't know how long

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,640
things are going to take because

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,280
everything takes a different amount of

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,079
time to go through the system um and

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,320
really having an undefined system if you

33
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,280
don't have a description of how things

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,680
go through each of your systems you

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,200
could have many systems in your

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,720
organization

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,240
then how do we know that each thing that

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,240
goes through each system is going

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,399
through it in a consistent way which

40
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,280
enables that predictability right that

41
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,759
we can optimize the way things things

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,479
move through it um

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,079
so that will all all of those

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,880
unpredictabilities those

45
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,960
frictions um to our ability to do stuff

46
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,759
and inconsistent frictions to our

47
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,079
ability to do stuff will will impact on

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,240
the performance of our organization

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,200
ation it will impact on Revenue growth

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
it will impact on profitability um it

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,319
will impact on our ability to be

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,599
competitive in the market so the role of

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,239
agile in this story the role of agile in

54
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:24,519
in enabling predictability or agility in

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:26,519
enabling predictability is um in the the

56
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,280
application

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:34,360
of the ideas

58
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,800
it it's a lot about changing from rules

59
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,040
to principles instead of having a bunch

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,200
of rules that people mindly follow

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,640
mindlessly follow have a bunch of uh

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,120
principles under which the the folks

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,519
that you have within your organization

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,640
can make decisions Define the systems

65
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,159
that you have um and how you want them

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,280
to work not just as a as as leadership

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,760
telling people how to do it but but the

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,440
people that are doing the work Define

69
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,879
the systems that's pushing

70
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,319
responsibility down the organization to

71
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,319
the people who are actually doing the

72
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:17,680
work um and agile or the mindset of

73
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,599
agility um the agile philosophy is about

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,239
enabling people in our

75
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,920
organization

76
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,040
to improve the predictability of our

77
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,159
business

78
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,239
outcomes by impr improving the

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,760
predictability of the things that they

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,159
do and I think one of the difficulties

81
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,239
is that most organizations most people

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,680
in organizations are not looking at

83
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,080
predictability metrics they're not

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,360
looking at the the the the the data that

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,680
indicates um instabilities in the system

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,079
that are the things that you want to you

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,159
want to control you want to um where it

88
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,959
can be controlled where you want to to

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:10,280
to make changes so this this whole idea

90
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,879
of um increasing business predict

91
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,640
predictability is not something that

92
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,759
just randomly happens it's not something

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,959
that um just installing agility in your

94
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
organization is going to going to going

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,840
to result in an increased level of of

96
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,520
business predictability but it's

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,840
something that is systematic that is

98
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:35,919
deliberate that requires effort and

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:40,280
consistency of application and over over

100
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,120
a longer period of time to start making

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,680
the changes moving the needles to

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,160
increase the level of

103
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,000
predictability within your business

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,720
there's a myth that I see all the time

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
in

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,120
organizations um at every level that

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,720
because we're doing agile um we can't

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,280
plan or predict what's going to happen

109
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,840
we can't do we're not supposed to do

110
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,120
estimates um we're not supposed to be

111
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,240
looking forward too far into the future

112
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,960
um and all all of that is kind of bunkum

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,120
right

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,039
agility the the the fundamental

115
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,880
principle of agility is about minimizing

116
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:21,840
the amount of work you do until it needs

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,840
to be

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,600
done we we don't want to do

119
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,680
documentation that is going to change

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,360
frequen frequently un unless we need

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,600
that documentation in order to

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,960
understand what we need to change we'd

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,440
be better building some product right

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,840
build some product tested in the market

125
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:46,880
see get get into those tight feedback

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:49,240
clips and that's one of the key things

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,360
that I find that organizations really

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,319
struggle at within the context of of

129
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,600
predictability they they don't close the

130
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,759
feedback loops um so if you're if you're

131
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,120
looking at what you're doing within the

132
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,800
context of agility this myth that you

133
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,319
can't plan for the future is is just

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,680
that a myth uh the poster child for for

135
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:19,120
agility um is is Microsoft's transition

136
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,160
in the last whole 10 12 years and um

137
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,440
they they do they do planning looking

138
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,360
forward over 18 months right the

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,400
granularity is really uh really high

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,479
level but they do plan over over 18

141
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,319
months um they do a season based model

142
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,520
and they plan for 18 month seasons and

143
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,120
there's nothing wrong with that there's

144
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,400
nothing anti- agile about that but it's

145
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,800
the way that you do it it's how you

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,080
implement it is that 18month plan

147
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,400
something that is enshrined in this is

148
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,280
what we're going to do how changeable

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,680
and malleable is that plan over time um

150
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,720
and how much effort do you spend on that

151
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,960
plan versus doing the work that you need

152
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,319
to do just now those are all things that

153
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,759
belly this myth um that you can't plan

154
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,199
or predict because you're doing agile

155
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,599
you absolutely can you just use

156
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,680
different tools and techniques to be

157
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,440
able to achieve there's a really famous

158
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,280
quote

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:31,919
um plans are irrelevant planning is

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,199
everything and that's the key to

161
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
success within the context of business

162
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,919
predictability right if you want to

163
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,720
increase the predictability of your

164
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,560
business you need to stop creating

165
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,680
plans and start planning what is it

166
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,840
we're going to do next where do we want

167
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
to go what do we want to achieve if

168
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,720
we're answering those questions and then

169
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
communicating it effectively within the

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,159
business we can enable a level of

171
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,879
strategic alignment with everybody in

172
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,560
our organization that we become a team

173
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,000
if you look up team in the dictionary it

174
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,039
says a group of people working together

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,599
towards a common goal how can we do that

176
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,759
if we don't have that common goal and a

177
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,240
goal is a single thing it's not a whole

178
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,800
bunch of things so what is it that your

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,919
business is trying to achieve that you

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,520
want everybody and every product and

181
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,800
every effort to align behind for a

182
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,039
particular product within the context of

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,000
that business what is the thing that you

184
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
want everybody working together towards

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,279
the outcomes of that product to a line

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
behind what's the product's goal what is

187
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,240
it we're trying to achieve the vision

188
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,279
the strategy what are we trying to

189
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,719
achieve and these are things that are

190
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,519
commonly missing in organizations and

191
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,279
that creates a

192
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,720
fragmentation of effort right so the

193
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,040
effort that people put in is in a

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,600
direction of their choosing each

195
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,440
individual on a on on on the team's

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,279
effort of their choosing each man

197
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,399
manager effort of their choosing each

198
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,480
leader effort of their choosing each

199
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,000
product owner effort of their choosing

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,240
how do we enable us to be all working

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,920
together towards that common common goal

202
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,600
and that requires planning to get

203
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,640
predictability um so we're not really

204
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,160
talking about um risk mitigation as a as

205
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,440
a document right we're talking about

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,920
risk mitigation as a holistic strategy

207
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,600
for our organization we're not talking

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,360
about uh resource management at the

209
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,240
individual level we're talking about how

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,920
where are our investment opportunities

211
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,880
as a business that fit inside of our

212
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,880
strategic goals and strategy and how

213
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:53,360
many uh um how much money right are we

214
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
applying to solve that particular

215
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,600
problem or gain that particular

216
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,880
capability and that will denote the the

217
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,720
number of people that are available that

218
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,440
we can hire to go work towards that

219
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,360
outcome so that this this whole idea of

220
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,680
planning to gain predictability is to

221
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,600
enable your business to have a

222
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,760
competitive advantage in the market

223
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,640
against other businesses in the same

224
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Market naked agility can

225
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:28,880
help you increase your your business

226
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,480
predictability by enabling you to be

227
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
able to do do that so we we can't we

228
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,360
can't come in and just provide you with

229
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,200
um increase your business predictability

230
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,519
we can't do that you need to do that

231
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,720
it's your business it's your

232
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:49,000
organization it's your department it's

233
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,000
your team the only people that can help

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,160
you increase that predictability or that

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,360
can increase that predictability are you

236
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,120
we can bring our knowledge and expertise

237
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,360
of what has worked in other

238
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,760
organizations we can bring um ways and

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,200
tools for analyzing the data what's the

240
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,920
current state of your system helping you

241
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,320
define your system so that you can then

242
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,279
see where the problems are that are

243
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,519
reducing your predictability so that you

244
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:24,480
can fix them right so one of the big

245
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,920
things we bring is visibility so that

246
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,800
you can see what's going on if you can

247
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,360
see what's going on you can make tweets

248
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,120
to the way you do things you can help

249
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,120
the people that you work with make

250
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,600
tweaks to the way they do things to

251
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,600
hopefully increase that level of

252
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,440
predictability within your business now

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,680
that can be be data driven right we can

254
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,839
we can look at data for for team morale

255
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,480
and capability we can look at data for

256
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:54,079
um Knowledge and Skills but it's a data

257
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
driven we can look at profitability of

258
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,560
the business and where we're spending

259
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,560
the money these are all datab driven

260
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,600
approaches we can then help bring um

261
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,279
Frameworks and and methodologies right

262
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,519
ideologies philosophies what are

263
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:15,040
things that are holistic to all

264
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,160
businesses that can enable you to look

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,959
at things in a different way to be able

266
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,199
to see what's going on to make make

267
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,480
those changes so things like Perhaps

268
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,320
Perhaps scrum is a good idea perhaps

269
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,399
caman is a good idea um perhaps lean

270
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,079
thinking is a good idea perhaps lean us

271
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,600
is a good idea there are all sorts of

272
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,560
tools

273
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,440
Frameworks um ideas available that have

274
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,240
been shown to work in many different

275
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,000
sorts of businesses that we can try and

276
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
analyze and see if it works for your

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,680
business in your

278
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:52,760
context so what we're offering is a

279
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,639
completely custom solution for your

280
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,839
business that doesn't make you like

281
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:01,800
somebody else's business one of the

282
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,880
things that I commonly see as as a as a

283
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,680
bad thing I guess trying to think of the

284
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,440
words but as as a negative consequence

285
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,440
to going and working or pulling in a

286
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,600
large Consulting organization that

287
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,199
brings a standard methodology and

288
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,399
practice and then applies it to your

289
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:24,240
business is that you

290
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,000
become like every other business that

291
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,160
they've applied it

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,959
to and one of the things that made your

293
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,360
your business

294
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,279
successful was its unique ability to

295
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,959
take advantage of a niche that you've

296
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,160
built in a market right you your

297
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,519
business grow to take advantage of a

298
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,720
niche and if somebody comes along and

299
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,320
applies their business practices or

300
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,839
their system or their thing on top of it

301
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,680
then you're just like every other

302
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,560
company that uses that same system like

303
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,519
uh a great example is is uh

304
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:08,079
um uh uh Road Road Road hauling right if

305
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,560
you're you're moving Goods around um

306
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,720
it's maybe not a good example because

307
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:17,320
those businesses are fairly standard

308
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,079
but businesses that use the same tooling

309
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,360
as every other business that does the

310
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,720
same thing is just the same business

311
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,920
just with a different owner right or a

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,199
different

313
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,639
funer they're they're not different

314
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,360
there's no dis valuation in the market

315
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
they're just filling that market how do

316
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,240
they open new markets how do they

317
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,519
ingenuously solve problems in

318
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,800
interesting ways that helps them adapt

319
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,040
their business towards a new Niche or

320
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,959
new capability or open up new markets

321
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,720
well they can't because they're working

322
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,639
within a structured system that doesn't

323
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,440
allow them to to explore other

324
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:59,360
opportunities so what we want to do as a

325
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,279
business is come up with our own way of

326
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,839
moving from whatever it is we're doing

327
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,120
now towards a greater degree of agility

328
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,480
so that it's our business processes it's

329
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,920
our unique way of doing things to fill

330
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,120
that unique Niche and if you look at

331
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,320
every

332
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,120
single commercial successful

333
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,279
organization that has adopted um agile

334
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,199
practices especially agile practices at

335
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,519
scale you'll see that every single one

336
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,800
of them has created their own Sy system

337
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
that fits the way they want to do

338
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,639
business and is shaped by the way they

339
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,480
want to do business they're not just

340
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,440
installing somebody else's system um and

341
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,240
that's why Microsoft used the season

342
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,480
based model Spotify have have what they

343
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,519
do right Google have have have their way

344
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,839
of doing things every single one of

345
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,040
these organizations has a unique way

346
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,880
that's bespoke to them of solving this

347
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,120
problem of how do we increase our

348
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,000
business predictability ability and our

349
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,199
ability to serve the markets within

350
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,480
which we're in it's pretty

351
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,639
hard to

352
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,360
describe what does it look like sound

353
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,519
like or feel

354
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,600
like once you're on this journey and

355
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,199
you've made some progress

356
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:26,839
towards uh um a greater degree of of of

357
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,639
of adaptability of a higher degree of of

358
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,600
predictability it's going to impact on

359
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,240
everything in your organization a great

360
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:40,160
um uh uh uh Microsoft is often asked um

361
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,240
what changed right when when you made

362
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,319
these changes and adaptations to your

363
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,399
business what changed and the answer is

364
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,519
usually

365
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,480
everything every everything changed the

366
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,199

the people who build the products and

374
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,240
the outside world has changed every part

375
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,160
of their um business processes have

376
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,120
changed in their entire

377
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
organization and now that's a little bit

378
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,720
of an overestimation not everything has

379
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,760
changed they still have they're still on

380
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,199
their Journey right they're still on

381
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,439
their journey and they've not addressed

382
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,240
some things that they probably could

383
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,360
address but they've done a good job of

384
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,240
tackling some of those big things

385
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,440
a great example you can go look up is

386
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,679
the the the the change in the way they

387
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,280
measure um bonuses for sales people

388
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,000
right it used to be that they were

389
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,919
measured based on the amount of time

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,760
Azure time that they sell because Azure

391
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,280
is the big selling Fe right how much is

392
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,799
your do you sell but now it's on usage

393
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,120
because if you measure how much time do

394
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,200
they sell the salesperson gets the

395
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,320
customer to clinch the deal they're a

396
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,600
closer right that's who you want as a

397
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,720
salesperson is a closer

398
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,320
and then the customer has paid the money

399
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,799
the salesperson gets their bonus but the

400
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,559
problem with that is what happens at the

401
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,799
end of the year when the customer hasn't

402
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:13,039
used the thing they've paid for and it

403
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,400
expires right they bought a year worth

404
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,320
of stuff they've used 10% of it now

405
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,720
they're annoyed angry that they've had

406
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,200
90% of their funds have been wasted so

407
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,280
if you switch that around to usage that

408
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,880
the sales folks get their bonus based on

409
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,559
usage they then need different skills

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,919
they're not a dual closer right this is

411
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,480
this is an example of a little tweak in

412
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:39,080
the way a business functions that has a

413
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,080
massive impact this the the perfect

414
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,799
salesperson is no longer a closer

415
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:50,000
they're an enabler they enable your

416
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:53,080
company to help this customer use the

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,799
service more and more and more so for

418
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:00,159
example perhaps the the closer uh brings

419
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,280
in an expert and to bamboozle the

420
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,360
customer with all the cool things that

421
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,200
you can do and they close the deal and

422
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:11,240
they're done right but what the enabler

423
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,760
does is it brings in perhaps out of

424
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,200
their own budget they're going to bring

425
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,720
in and pay external consultants and

426
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,280
helpers to help over a longer term

427
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,080
enable that customer to use the services

428
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,360
more so now we're talking about what

429
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,080
enables you to use as your more agile

430
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,480
transition right Dev cobs all of these

431
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,480
things mean that you need to consume

432
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,120
things more quickly and it benefits both

433
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,000
parties right it benefits both Microsoft

434
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,679
because they get to sell more asure and

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,840
if it benefits the customer because then

436
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,760
they're they're able to adapt to their

437
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,120
Market needs more quickly and more

438
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:54,039
effectively and that is that core what

439
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,240
does it what does it look and feel like

440
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:00,159
it looks and feels like everybody

441
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,200
working together towards a common goal

442
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,840
right we're not working against our

443
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,919
customers we're working with our

444
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,080
customers we're not working against each

445
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,400
other we're working with each other and

446
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,280
that is the

447
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,280
superpower that brings this whole story

448
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,640
together so it changes the the the the

449
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,919
behaviors of people in your organization

450
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,640
it changes the organizational culture it

451
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,440
changes the experience that both

452
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,679
employees and stakeholders have and it

453
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,760
changes the way that you measure success

454
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,400
in your business so everything will

455
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,240
change if you embark on this journey but

456
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,120
you'll have at the end of that Journey

457
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,799
at the end of that Journey it never ends

458
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,720
but once you've made some progress on

459
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,960
that Journey you will have a a a more

460
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,559
predictability in your business and a

461
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,640
higher ability to take advantage of

462
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,360
Market opportunities when they arise

463
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,679
because you're then able to deal with

464
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,600
surprises because you've got that level

465
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,600
of predictability
