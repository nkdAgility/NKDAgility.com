# What is sprint planning?

A #sprint is a container within #scrum where all the work, events, and artefacts of the #scrumframework happens. Often, it's a predetermined length somewhere between one and four weeks, and the intention of the team is to produce a working product within that time box.

#sprintplanning is an event where the #scrumteam come together to plan the work that will take place in the upcoming sprint. In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what sprint planning is, why it matters, and how teams can do it effectively.
