1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,860
so the question is what is Sprint

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,420
planning

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,260
uh there's a more important question

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,660
there why why is Sprint planning right

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:21,060
uh but what is print planning it it's

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,260
it's a time where

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,840
um we get together and we we plan what

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,519
we're going to do over the next uh

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,399
whatever Sprint length we have over the

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,260
next Sprint uh two weeks uh three weeks

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,820
four weeks three days whatever your

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,200
Sprint length is

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,420
um we're gonna we're gonna plan the

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,300
Sprint right so Sprint planning is about

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,500
planning the Sprint kind of makes sense

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,280
um but

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,100
it matters because it gives us that that

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,200
moment that check-in which could be

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,960
short it could be a tiny Sprint planning

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,120
because we everybody already knows where

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,940
we're going already understands what

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,160
we're going to take on we're gonna get a

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,140
get in a room five minutes later we're

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
out we're done or it could even be it

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,439
could be a check-in an asynchronous

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,299
check-in over over slack or teams right

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,340
do we all understand where we're going

28
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,900
and the the point is the understanding

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,820
do we all understand what we're trying

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,619
to achieve this Sprint do we all

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,180
understand what's involved in it what

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,340
direction we're going what needs to

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,799
happen in order to get there

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,479
that's the purpose of Sprint planning

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,020
and

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,080
um it's it's a lot of a lot of uh uh

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,500
people come along and say well you know

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,159
we do kanban so you know we don't do

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,380
Sprint planning and my question is when

40
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,200
do you decide what work you're going to

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,960
pull into the Sprint how does that work

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,200
get onto that list of things that list

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,259
of options right that the team is able

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,479
to select from that is an effect Sprint

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,240
planning whether you're involved in it

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,979
as the team or not right that is Sprint

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,740
planning and wouldn't it be better if

48
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,320
you were involved in it and effective

49
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,780
kanban teams are normally involved in it

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,940
right there they've got to say in what

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,040
ends up on the options what goes in

52
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,780
there what's what's what's ready to pull

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,120
into the Sprint

54
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,520
that's Sprint planning right you've got

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,840
refinement which comes before Sprint

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,599
planning which is how like

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,459
building that list of options

58
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,980
and then Sprint planning is really about

59
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,239
just deciding what is the next list of

60
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,940
options

61
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,400
from a kanban perspective from a scrum

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,040
perspective the same thing is true you

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,400
have you have refinement which is all

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
the work that you do that's not on on

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,220
the current you know adding features to

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
the product and then Sprint planning is

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,120
about

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
now we understand all of that stuff that

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,959
we would like the product to do that it

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,739
doesn't do yet

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,599
what is the things that we need to do in

72
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,160
the next two weeks

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,800
iteration

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,900
so we're planning right in the next two

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,580
week iteration or that we think we need

76
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,500
in the next two week iteration that

77
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,659
we're going to pull into the Sprint

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,060
um and that might be you know here's

79
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,379
here's here's our Sprint goal here's

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,000
what we're going to try and achieve this

81
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,739
Sprint like this is the communication

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,239
goal the thing we're going to commit to

83
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:27,360
if you're doing scrum you commit to the

84
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,360
Sprint goal right but that might only be

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
a small percentage of the work that you

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,620
need to do in the Sprint because we've

87
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,599
also got that you know we're we're we

88
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,080
had some live site incidents and we've

89
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,060
got a large refactoring exercise of our

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,500
architecture that's going on and we're

91
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,420
doing a little bit of that every Sprint

92
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,340
so we're spending 20 percent of our time

93
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,440
every Sprint doing that

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,000
um we have we have some technical debt

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,379
that we're working through that we've

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,819
discovered

97
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,519
um and we're going to spend 10 of our

98
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,620
time on on technical debt uh we've got

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,420
some some bugs some things that that

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,560
customers have reported so we might have

101
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,080
some things that they've reported some

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,760
defects some bugs actual errors in the

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,260
product we're going to bring bring some

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,180
of them into the Sprint every Sprint

105
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,580
right otherwise you end up with a

106
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,620
dumbass bug fixing stripe Sprint right

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,100
we're going to do a little bit of

108
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,120
everything all the time to maintain our

109
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,800
product

110
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,600
and Sprint planning is about deciding

111
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,520
what all of those things are and what

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,680
the percentages are that we think we're

113
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,479
going to be able to take on this print

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,940
right so you don't want your Sprint

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,759
planning to say oh we're going to spend

116
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,820
100 of our time on our on our on our uh

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,979
sprinkle right that would be silly

118
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,080
because what happens when something

119
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:45,060
happens in the product right there's a

120
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,120
production incident well now we're

121
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,639
screwed right or uh somebody comes

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,020
running in from the business saying I

123
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479
know you're working on all this stuff

124
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,360
but this has happened and this is the

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,940
most important thing that to us right

126
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,900
now and if we don't have some being

127
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
being

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,240
um what's it called when you make it

129
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,000
bigger than it is hyperbole right I I I

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,160
if we don't get this done by Thursday

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,220
we're all out of business and all out of

132
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,080
a job right do we just go no I'm sorry

133
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,580
we've planned our Sprint we can't take

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,740
that or do we create a system within

135
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,500
which we can have those conversations

136
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,000
that we can see well I you know yeah

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,520
that sounds really important let's bring

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,500
that into the Sprint or

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,900
um you know also a customer reports some

140
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,220
little bugs and the customer says can

141
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,900
you please get them fixed because

142
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,820
they're just just annoying and they're

143
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,800
annoying a bunch of our users yeah sure

144
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,720
let's fix them let's bring them into the

145
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,300
Sprint let's get them fixed how do you

146
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,220
create that Urban Flow

147
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,520
of the work that you're doing while

148
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,400
still maintaining Direction and strategy

149
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,500
right so you've got the product goal

150
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,000
which is your overall what's the next

151
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,320
big thing we're working on but the

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Sprint goal is what's the next little

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,220
thing we're working on and that's what

154
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,400
we commit to and that's what we decide

155
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,300
at Sprint planning so it creates that

156
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Cadence of success Cadence of

157
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,440
achievement right what are we trying to

158
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,259
achieve this Brent yeah we've done these

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,300
hundred little things but also we did

160
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,100
this which the customer was really

161
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,900
looking forward to that we had

162
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,380
conversations with the customer about

163
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,759
that we crafted into a Sprint goal and

164
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,160
that's one of the things that we do at

165
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,380
Sprint planning so I feel like

166
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,500
regardless of whether

167
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,039
you're doing a little little K kanban

168
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,860
right or or big S scrum

169
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,020
uh you're you're really working towards

170
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,840
the same idea and can use the same tools

171
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,380
and techniques there's also big kanban

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,120
the kanban method which has its own

173
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,100
structure and process and rules that's

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,860
that's its own thing

175
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,919
um but if you're looking at scrum

176
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,220
and kanban you definitely want scrum and

177
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,380
kanban scrum is about planning

178
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,600
which is why this starts with the Sprint

179
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,319
planning it's all about planning

180
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,759
kanban is about delivery so bringing

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,620
them both together and you actually get

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,259
the best of both worlds

183
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,720
you get that planning Cadence connecting

184
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,039
with customers understanding what we're

185
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,680
