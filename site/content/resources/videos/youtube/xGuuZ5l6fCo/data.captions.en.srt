1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,840
another question to ask leadership is

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:12,000
are teams empowered to change the

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:14,920
requirements based on user feedback so

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,560
this is not just Gathering the feedback

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,160
are you actually able to change the

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,000
requirements for your product and and I

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,279
and I don't mean like little things on

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
your product backlog or little things

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,560
that you want your product to do what if

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,160
you find out that a huge chunky thing is

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,640
no longer viable or no longer what the

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,520
business needs are you able to close

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,039
that Loop are you able to take that

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,360
feedback and actually action it and make

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,440
changes to the requirements one of the

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,760
things that happens a lot especially

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,719
when you do sessions where you're

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,399
engaging with the people who are going

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,079
to be your users and you're asking them

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,120
what they want um this is especially

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,719
important for for business systems but

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,200
also for commercial for B2B but also for

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:10,040
commercial um is that when when if I ask

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,439
you what do you need in a system the

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,360
first thing you're going to think about

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,320
is all the things that you need now

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,720
right all of those things are too late

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,280
all of those things are stuff we should

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,600
actually already have in the product we

30
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,000
should already be able to do because the

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,200
delay and actually building it to get

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,240
you to the point where you can use it is

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,439
is going to be quite tough right it's

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,479
going to you're you're you as the

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,320
business as the consumer of the product

36
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,040
that you're you're asking for you're

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,560
Perhaps Perhaps losing money or you're

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,720
perhaps losing time or you're losing

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,320
something by not having this problem

40
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:49,200
that's been identified solved right

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,200
um but you're going to you're going to

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,520
give me this big chunk of things that

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,759
you need now and then you're going to go

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,039
away and think about what might my

45
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:04,560
business need over the next whatever the

46
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,560
delivery cycle is so let's say we you

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,440
know we are going to deliver on a on a

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,679
3-weekly Cadence where we're we're

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,160
definitely doing doing some amount of

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,080
agil but the business goes away and

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,800
thinks about what's going to H this

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,599
product's going to last us for the next

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,000
few years right it's going to be in

54
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,120
production for the next few years um

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,720
what types of things do we think we

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
might need to work towards in order to

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
have that that that products support for

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
that length of time so they're going to

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,560
think about what's going to happen in

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
the future in the business what are the

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,480
choices that are going to need to be

62
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,360
made in the business and they'll think

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,800
about that big Choice that's coming up

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,040
we're going to make a big choice in this

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,599
business in in let's say it's three

66
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,000
months time um and it could go A or B

67
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,440
right I'm making it simple it could be a

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,879
octopus problem right but A or B and if

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,640
we need a we've got 50 things we want

70
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,360
and we've be we've got another different

71
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,360
50 things we

72
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,319
want what what happens when we get to

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
that decision and users are able to

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,920
feedback to us that we've got to that

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,760
decision are we able to remove half of

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,239
those work items the half that we don't

77
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,599
need what about if we've delivered some

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,640
of those 50 work items that are going to

79
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:23,000
be of value we deliver let's say we

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,360
deliver 15 of them 15 things um and we

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,920
get feedback from the users that yeah

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,799
you're solving this problem just now

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,200
this this business problem is resolved

84
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,439
from our perspective that other stuff

85
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,360
that we put on your list you've

86
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,319
delivered the most valuable piece and

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
the rest is is not as valuable can we go

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,400
delete the rest of those requirements or

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,879
at least deprioritize them or not do

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,480
them right how quickly can you close

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,840
those feedback loops can you actually

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,879
make those changes in the system quite

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,640
often I see teams talking to users I see

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,319
teams engaging uh uh uh and getting

95
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,120
feedback and then not being a able to do

96
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,439
anything with it they're not actually

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,959
able to change the requirements because

98
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,760
somebody else has locked them in and

99
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,680
we're not allowed to change them or or

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,640
because we don't want them to change the

101
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,639
system because perhaps there's a crazy

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,519
contract in the way we create a

103
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,680
convoluted complicated change requests

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,040
system that's very expensive to follow

105
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,720
um to try and dissuade people from

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,800
making changes we don't want those

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,080
things we want to be a adapting to the

108
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,680
needs of the customer that we're sing

109
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,120
we're adapting to the market needs and

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,520
their Market needs are changing

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,280
constantly which means our product and

112
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,479
the things we think we're going to do in

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,240
the product need to also change

114
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,960
constantly which means as well that if

115
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,320
you do have contracts you need to build

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,840
into the story of the contract that

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,919
these things are going to change

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,800
constantly make sure that your teams are

119
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,720
empowered to change the requirements

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,240
based on user feedback if your answer to

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,120
any one of these questions or the answer

122
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,919
of your business to any one of these

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,759
questions is no we're not doing that

124
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,440
then you would probably I probably

125
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,880
wouldn't consider that you're already in

126
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,319
the agile space right you're not already

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,880
agile you might be working towards it

128
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,720
and you might have put in loads of

129
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,520
effort but unless you can Mark every

130
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:37,080
every single one of these six questions

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,639
as yes we do this this is how things

132
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,160
work here then we're still lacking we're

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,440
still trying we're still working towards

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,840
being agile now this is just a litmus

135
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,919
test dreamed up uh by uh the US

136
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,319
Department of Defense but they are

137
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,080
probably the least likely place for you

138
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,840
to expect something um Within this High

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,120
a bar to have come from and I'm not

140
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,599
going to um go into a team uh and work

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,800
with a team or a company and if they're

142
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,280
not doing these things then I'm going to

143
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,080
say well you guys suck you're not agile

144
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,560
because you're not doing this that's

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:22,840
that's not how we work towards success

146
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:25,280
uh but I think it's hugely valuable from

147
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,160
the perspective of

148
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,560
self-reflection for you all to think

149
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,599
about the process cesses and practices

150
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,919
in your organization and are you a how

151
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,039
many of these six questions are you able

152
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,599
to achieve and what could you do to make

153
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,520
it a little bit easier for the teams for

154
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:53,560
the people doing the work to work

155
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:53,560
towards this idea of not being agile BS
