1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,040
don't scale scrum is a a phrase that

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,320
I've heard uh quite a lot and I think

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:13,679
it's it's utter bollocks

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,000
um it implies that there is no scaling

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,240
within the context of scrum and while

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,599
yes scrum explicitly focuses the scrum

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,560
guide focuses on one team building one

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:33,280
product we can use scrum to scale scrum

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,079
and deliver more value at a higher scale

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,600
um and if you look at Nexus Nexus is a

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:43,280
great example of using scrum to scale

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,760
scrum it is just scrum but it adds some

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
additional things that you need to

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,320
concern yourself with the scale so use

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,320
scrum to scale scum
