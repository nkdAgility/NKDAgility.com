    "reasoning": "This content focuses on scaling Scrum and the Nexus framework, highlighting practices and perspectives around Scrum at scale. However, it does not discuss agentic principles (e.g., autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, human-agent collaboration) or the integration of AI-driven agency in software delivery. There is no exploration of modern engineering for agentic delivery, governance for agents, or feedback loops grounded in agentic design. The article addresses only human-driven Scrum scaling, which is explicitly excluded from the 'Agentic Software Delivery' category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content is solely about human-centric Scrum scaling, not agentic delivery. There are no references to AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agency in delivery practices. The fit is minimal and mostly unrelated.",
