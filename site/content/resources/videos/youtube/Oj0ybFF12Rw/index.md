## "Don't scale scrum" - A Common RefrainÂ 

ðŸ™„ The phrase "Don't scale scrum!" is something I've heard quite frequently.Â 

Let's explore this statement â€“ is it pragmatic caution or simply defeatist?Â 

## The Misconception: Scrum Doesn't ScaleÂ 

ðŸ¤” Many believe that Scrum, by design, cannot scale. While it's true that the Scrum Guide focuses on one team building one product, the idea that Scrum can't be scaled is, frankly, rubbish.Â 

## Nexus: Scrum Scaling ScrumÂ 

ðŸš€ Nexus is a shining example of Scrum scaling Scrum. It doesn't deviate from the essence but adds nuances to address challenges at scale.Â 

- **Scrum at Its Core**: Nexus retains the Scrum framework at its heart.Â 

- **Addressing Scale**: It introduces additional elements to tackle scaling complexities.Â 

- **Delivering Value**: Nexus proves that you can amplify value delivery using Scrum at a larger scale.Â 

## How-To: Embracing Scaling in ScrumÂ 

ðŸ’¡ Scaling doesn't have to be an antithesis to Scrum. Here are some recommendations:Â 

- **Understand Nexus**: Dive deep into Nexus and how it seamlessly scales Scrum.Â 

- **Start Small, Think Big**: Begin with one Scrum team and then scale thoughtfully.Â 

- **Adapt and Iterate**: Scaling is about learning and adapting, just like Scrum.Â 

## Pragmatic, Not DefeatistÂ 

ðŸŒŸ The notion of "Don't scale Scrum" is not pragmatic wisdom; it's a defeatist attitude.Â Â 

Scrum can and has been scaled successfully, delivering more value than ever.
