1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,900
oh that's a good question how how will a

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,719
psm2 class

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,160
help a scrum Master progress on their

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,420
career

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,560
I think the thing we tackle in the PSM

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,060
to

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,220
or the the the advanced PSM is

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,699
the things

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,160
we try and tackle a lot of the things

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,719
all right how do I explain this Croft I

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
think Croft is a great word for this

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,620
right when you do things for long enough

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,600
Croft builds up all the things that are

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,879
are holding you back like the Barnacles

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,399
on a ship right they're they're making

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,980
it slower it's less effective it's it's

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,079
less sleek and the psm2 is about

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,960
scraping those Barnacles off so that you

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,239
can go go win the race so you can be

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,180
more effective because we we pick up all

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,699
sorts of weird weird things that we we

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,059
it's the way we work right our ways of

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,059
working get

24
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,220
indoctrinated into the company's way of

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,159
working right and sometimes we're forced

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,860
at certain points in our career or in

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,040
doing stuff to make compromises

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,920
and those compromises work great in that

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,040
space But then they become enshrined in

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,220
the way we do things our craft right we

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,080
adopt some of that craft and we need a

32
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,280
little bit of a reset to figure out what

33
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,439
is and isn't uh the ship and what is uh

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,920
the bit we can get rid of right if I'm

35
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,159
back to the Barnacle analogy so

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,900
um the the PSM is about removing the

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,479
Barnacles from the ship that's really

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,020
what it's about it's about identifying

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,079
those those things that you find that

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,200
scrum Masters get pushed towards in

41
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,439
organizations because perhaps when they

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,259
were starting out as a scrum Master they

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,399
didn't have the the the the confidence

44
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,619
to say no or the confidence to correct

45
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,920
leadership or the confidence to

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,420
challenge leadership and say no we need

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
to do things a little bit different to

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,879
be more effective and and then that that

49
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,780
that craft gets just added to our

50
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,160
baggage so it's really uh

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,760
um

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,580
that that

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,340
differentiation of again what does a

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,780
professional scrum Master look like here

55
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,580
are a bunch of things that we've learned

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,620
how to do

57
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,860
um

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,500
and then bring it bring it towards and

59
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,920
what we do want people to do as a as a

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,640
scrum master and I think it also there's

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,560
lots of people who are scrum Masters who

62
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,300
um perhaps scrum Masters for quite some

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,660
time and have had no formal training

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,680
right they've they've they've not had

65
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,560
any experience whatsoever of uh um

66
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,060
exposure to to maybe they might not even

67
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,400
have ever read the scrum guide right

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,319
that's that's that's quite I have met

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,819
those those folks as well

70
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,580
um and they've been doing it but they've

71
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,620
been doing the role they've been picking

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,040
up the accountability they've been doing

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,440
uh the things in the organization and

74
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,140
they don't want to go do a scrum master

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,300
class because they're like well I know

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,099
how to be a scrum Master right they

77
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,620
don't but I don't know how to be a scrum

78
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,860
master and

79
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,980
um perhaps the advanced scrum Master is

80
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,480
a good way to to to level set a lot a

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,120
lot of those

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,580
um myths and that's something that we do

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,980
do at the beginning of the the PSN to

84
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,879
the advanced Grandmaster classes and we

85
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,220
we kind of try and kick some of those uh

86
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,980
common myths that you see people

87
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,780
fulfilling as a scrum master and reset

88
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,780
very quickly like at the start of the

89
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,060
class is a quick quick reset to here's

90
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,980
what it should look like like and then

91
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,720
based on it what it should look like

92
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:15,180
what are a whole bunch of I don't know

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,220
skills uh workshops activities that you

94
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,139
could run with your teams which is I

95
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,900
feel like that's what the the advanced

96
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,759
scrum Master really teaches is it's got

97
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,820
that short sharp level set at the

98
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,220
beginning and then it goes into a

99
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,919
teaching through experience right

100
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,020
through participation teaching different

101
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,639
techniques so we teach a whole bunch of

102
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,220
different liberating structures to help

103
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,900
not you know make getting a bunch of

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,720
people together suck less because it

105
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,660
generally sucks in organizations how to

106
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,360
uh different uh things to go look at

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,460
right so so how do you help the team

108
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,139
understand and improve their definition

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
of done well there's little little

110
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,160
workshops and things that people can

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,419
take away and do that which is why I

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,540
think at the end of the class there's

113
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:04,139
like is there 30 posters 20 between 20

114
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,720
and 30 posters a big infographics that

115
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,960
you can uh takeaway to maybe leverage

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,120
with teams and help help then help

117
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,860
you've become a more effective scrum

118
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Master how do I as a more effective

119
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,240
scrum Master than help my team be more

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,500
effective as well so there's kind of two

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,540
sides to it

122
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,460
um there's the the craft that we've

123
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,020
built up doing the role even if we wear

124
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,199
a professional scrum Master right we

125
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:31,860
passed our PSM psm1 like five years ago

126
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,020
or even 10 years ago or uh 13 years ago

127
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,580
like myself

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,800
um and we've built up some some some

129
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,919
some crafts and Barnacles that get stuck

130
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,780
to the hollow we need to knock them off

131
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,699
or we never had any formal training at

132
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,020
all and we've been doing doing the

133
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,000
accountability trying to do the

134
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,860
accountability of the scrum master and

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,479
perhaps we've learned from other

136
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,699
people's like we've adopted other

137
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,860
people's Barnacles onto our way of doing

138
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,539
things and we need that that that level

139
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,259
set and then what are the tools and

140
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,259
techniques we need

141
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,800
