## PSM II: The Game-Changer for [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Masters

Today, I want to tackle an important question I often receive, "How will a PSM II course challenge your assumptions the most?

If so, you're not alone.  Many Agile enthusiasts, like you and me, grapple with a multitude of assumptions, and the PSM II course is precisely crafted to challenge these notions.

Buckle up because this journey will shift your perspectives! 🚀

## Challenging Assumptions about Scrum Masters

What do you think a [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) is?  What do you believe a Scrum Master does?

We're often inundated with myths about the Scrum Master role.

One foundational shift is redefining who a Scrum Master truly is.  🔍

The myths surrounding this role are numerous, and we continually address these misconceptions in the PSM II course.  🧩 

So, Let's go ahead and debunk a few:

Let me break a few myths surrounding the PSM II course challenges down:

- The Jira Admin Myth: Contrary to some beliefs, think again when it comes to Jira Admin.  Scrum Masters aren't merely Jira admins.  They're so much more.  It's a disservice to box them into such a limited category.

- The Problem Solver Myth: A common misinterpretation is that Scrum Masters exist purely to solve the team's problems.  In reality, they catalyse the removal of impediments — not necessarily doing the work but empowering the team to do so.  Essentially, a Scrum Master aims to make their role almost redundant by fostering a self-sufficient team and pushing for self-reliance and reduced dependency.

- The "Invisibly Present" Paradigm: This is a concept I adore and one of my cherished takeaways from the PSM II course is the idea of being 'invisibly present'.  A Scrum Master's value isn't in their overt actions but in their nuanced guidance.  They shape and steer the way teams organise tasks.  Yet, if they were to be absent for a fortnight, the team's activities from retrospectives to daily scrums — would still proceed seamlessly.  This is because teams under a proficient Scrum Master recognise the intrinsic value of these processes rather than feeling compelled by external pressure.  That's the mark of true influence!

## Evolution from Scrum Master to Advanced Scrum Master

To me, this journey, this transition that I believe to be the pinnacle of the PSM II course from a foundational Scrum Master role to the advanced realms of Scrum expertise, represents the heart of the PSM II course.  🔄 

We are shifting from a task-oriented Scrum Master to a guide operating in advanced Scrum methodologies.  🌟

It's about that massive leap and transition into the advanced Scrum Master world.
