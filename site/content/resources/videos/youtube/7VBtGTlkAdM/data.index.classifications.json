    "reasoning": "The content focuses on consulting engagement challenges, contract rigidity, and outcome-oriented delivery. It mentions Agile and Scrum but never references agentic principles, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or modern agentic delivery practices. There is no discussion of AI agent integration, feedback loops, or governance frameworks. Alignment and depth are minimal, as the core of Agentic Software Delivery is not addressed. The target audience is adjacent (Agile consultants/practitioners), but the themes and language do not fit the category definition. There is nothing outdated or actively contra; the material is simply unrelated.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is unrelated to Agentic Software Delivery—no mention of AI agents, contextual intelligence, or agentic practices. It addresses Agile consulting contracts, which does not fit the category definition, making the alignment very weak.",
