1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,140
the thing that will completely sink your

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,420
Consulting engagement before it gets

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,139
started is the contract

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,420
um if your contract uh States

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,860
um exactly what needs to be delivered

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,179
when

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,880
um on what Cadence and how much it's

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,320
going to cost uh you're already screwed

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:26,039
right that that that's not the reality

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,320
of the unpredictable nature of building

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,119
products that don't exist yet

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,579
um and if you sign up to those contracts

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,440
you're you're you're just gonna have a

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,239
bad time

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,680
um make sure that you think about

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,320
how you don't want anything in your

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,700
contract that specifies exactly what

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,620
you're going to deliver and when you

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,020
want to be talking about the outcome

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,879
what is it you're trying to achieve and

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,020
what value are you going to deliver to

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,000
the customer

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,000
everything else is irrelevant
