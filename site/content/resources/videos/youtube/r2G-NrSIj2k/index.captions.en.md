There are multiple schools of thought on code reviews. One school of thought is that code reviews help us improve our code quality and help reduce defects because we've got multiple eyes looking at the product. But I think that's only part of the story. As we shift left, another school of thought starts to come to the forefront, which is our code should be pre-reviewed. A code review, a person manually code reviewing our code, should not actually be required because our code should already have been reviewed by the time we submit a pull request. 

That would then enable all of our pull requests to be almost totally automated, or as automated as we can get, so that the pull request process itself is not becoming a blocker to deliver value in our business. There are lots of different techniques and practices within the context of code reviews. I very much support and value code reviews and pull request systems that are in place in GitHub and in DevOps. 

I would absolutely recommend that nobody is able to commit code to master or main without going through a pull request and without passing validated checks. But those validated checks should be as automated as they can possibly be within the context of your system. Naked agility has helped others and can help you create automations and practices and procedures that enable you to have the highest quality possible code and detect defects as early as possible.
