1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,000
there are multiple schools of thought on

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,800
code reviews one school of thought is

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,639
that code reviews help us improve our

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
code quality help reduce defects because

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,800
we've get multiple eyes looking at the

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,680
product but I think that's only part of

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,960
the story as we shift left another

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,599
school of thought starts to come to the

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,759
Forefront which is our code should be

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,399
pre- reviewed a a code review a a a

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,640
person manually code reviewing our code

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,680
should not actually be required because

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
our code should already have been

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,000
reviewed by the time we submit a pool

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,520
request and that would then enable all

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,719
of our pool requests to be almost

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
totally automated or as automated as we

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,359
can get to so that the pool request

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,640
process itself is not becoming a blocker

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,199
to deliver value in our business so

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,200
there are lots of different techniques

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,720
and practices within the context of code

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,280
reviews I very much support and value H

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,439
code reviews and pool request systems

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,439
that are in place in in GitHub and inure

26
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:20,759
devops I I would absolutely recommend

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,079
that nobody is able to commit code H uh

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,119
to to master to main without going

29
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,680
through a pool request and without

30
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:33,520
passing uh validated checks but those

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,000
Val validated checks should be as

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,600
automated as they can possibly be within

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,600
the context of your system and naked

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,759
agility has helped others and can help

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,680
you create automations and practices and

36
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,200
procedures that enable you to have the

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,880
highest quality possible code and detect

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,880
defects as early as possible
