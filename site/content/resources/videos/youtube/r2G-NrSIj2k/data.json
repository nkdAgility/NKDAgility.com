    "description": "# Code Reviews Reimagined: Automate Quality and Shift Left | Martin Hinshelwood  \n\nðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I challenge traditional thinking about code reviews. While manual code reviews play a role in improving quality, shifting left opens the door to **pre-reviewed code** through automation, enabling teams to deliver value faster and with fewer bottlenecks. Letâ€™s explore how to reimagine code reviews and pull requests for modern software development.\n\n**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  \n1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: The Role of Code Reviews  \n2. 02:15 â€“ The Shift Left Approach to Pre-Reviewed Code  \n3. 05:30 â€“ Automating Pull Request Validation  \n4. 08:45 â€“ Best Practices for Code Reviews in GitHub and Azure DevOps  \n5. 12:00 â€“ Why Automation Reduces Defects Early  \n6. 15:30 â€“ Balancing Automation and Manual Review Needs  \n\n**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  \n- Developers and engineers looking to optimize their pull request workflows  \n- Teams struggling with slow or inefficient code review processes  \n- Organizations aiming to adopt automated quality checks to reduce defects  \n- Engineering leaders focused on improving development velocity and quality  \n\n**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  \n- Why traditional manual code reviews are only part of the story  \n- The concept of pre-reviewed code and how it improves efficiency  \n- How automated validation can streamline pull requests  \n- Best practices for integrating automated checks in GitHub and Azure DevOps  \n- Strategies for shifting left to catch defects earlier in the process  \n\n**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  \n- Code reviews should enhance quality, but automation can do much of the heavy lifting.  \n- Pre-reviewed code allows teams to minimize blockers and deliver value faster.  \n- Automated validation checks in pull request workflows are essential for high-quality code.  \n- Shifting left with automation ensures defects are detected earlier, reducing rework and delays.  \n \nAt [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), we help teams implement modern code review and automation practices to improve quality and accelerate delivery.
