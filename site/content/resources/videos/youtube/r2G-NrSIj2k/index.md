 # Code Reviews Reimagined: Automate Quality and Shift Left | Martin Hinshelwood  

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin Hinshelwood from [NKD Agility](https://www.nkdagility.com), and in this video, I challenge traditional thinking about code reviews. While manual code reviews play a role in improving quality, shifting left opens the door to **pre-reviewed code** through automation, enabling teams to deliver value faster and with fewer bottlenecks. Letâ€™s explore how to reimagine code reviews and pull requests for modern software development.

**ðŸ“Œ Chapters:**  
1. 00:00 â€“ Introduction: The Role of Code Reviews  
2. 02:15 â€“ The Shift Left Approach to Pre-Reviewed Code  
3. 05:30 â€“ Automating Pull Request Validation  
4. 08:45 â€“ Best Practices for Code Reviews in GitHub and Azure DevOps  
5. 12:00 â€“ Why Automation Reduces Defects Early  
6. 15:30 â€“ Balancing Automation and Manual Review Needs  

**ðŸŽ¯ Who This Video is For:**  
- Developers and engineers looking to optimize their pull request workflows  
- Teams struggling with slow or inefficient code review processes  
- Organizations aiming to adopt automated quality checks to reduce defects  
- Engineering leaders focused on improving development velocity and quality  

**ðŸ“– What Youâ€™ll Learn:**  
- Why traditional manual code reviews are only part of the story  
- The concept of pre-reviewed code and how it improves efficiency  
- How automated validation can streamline pull requests  
- Best practices for integrating automated checks in GitHub and Azure DevOps  
- Strategies for shifting left to catch defects earlier in the process  

**ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:**  
- Code reviews should enhance quality, but automation can do much of the heavy lifting.  
- Pre-reviewed code allows teams to minimize blockers and deliver value faster.  
- Automated validation checks in pull request workflows are essential for high-quality code.  
- Shifting left with automation ensures defects are detected earlier, reducing rework and delays.
