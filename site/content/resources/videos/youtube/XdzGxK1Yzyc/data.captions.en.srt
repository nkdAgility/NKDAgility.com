1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,080
so

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,219
the question is what what is a product

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
toner

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,719
and that is again an interesting

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
question because the the product owner

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,880
is

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,980
an accountability

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
so not not a job title right so I

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,160
wouldn't expect to see somebody whose

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,900
job title is product owner and I

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,880
wouldn't expect uh to see somebody

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,360
walking around going at you know I'm I'm

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,820
I'm I'm I'm the product owner but the

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,320
product owner accountabilities are

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,719
something that somebody in your

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,300
organization picks up and it's being

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,920
accountable for maximizing the value of

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,320
the work done by the scrum team

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
so that doesn't mean

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,760
doesn't mean that they're called product

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,379
owner doesn't mean that they only focus

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,960
on product ownership right they probably

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,960
have other focuses as well but it also

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,960
means that other things need to be true

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,340
in order for that to be successful right

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,719
maximizing the value of the work done by

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,540
the scrum team

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,380
is not ordering a product backlog right

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,840
that's that's a small mechanical element

30
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,960
of of that accountability

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,460
um in your context right your corporate

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,159
contacts your organizational context

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,740
you're going to have to figure out what

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,979
does product ownership mean in our

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,200
business right how do we maximize the

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,360
value of the work done do we need to

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,460
understand the market do we need to be

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,659
plugged into an understanding of what's

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,640
happening in the market and what

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,619
direction it's going do we need to be

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,659
plugged into an understanding of how

42
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,400
people are actually using our product

43
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,939
and interacting with it in different

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,920
ways do we need to be plugged into what

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,020
our customers are saying right that's

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,939
another thing that might piece of piece

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,740
of information that might be helpful

48
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,460
and the answer is you have to plug into

49
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,520
all of that and much more right the the

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,500
the the the more understanding that the

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,700
product owner the person who's picking

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,619
up the accountability of the product

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:12,599
owner has of what's going on in the

54
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:14,280
world that may impact on what it is that

55
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,120
we're working on what it is that we're

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
doing

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,940
so

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,280
um the product owner is absolutely

59
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,980
essential as they kind of set that tone

60
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,440
for for for product leadership for

61
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,720
strategic direction of the product for

62
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,640
uh um

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,500
um

64
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,959
building building something that really

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,340
resonates with the market and if it

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,500
resonates with the market that means

67
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,720
it's resonating with your customers that

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,980
your stakeholders understand what it is

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,200
you're working on what they're doing

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,060
that everything is being communicated

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,440
openly and transparently so we all

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,420
understand where we're going we're all

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
going in the same these are all things

74
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,620
that that product owner that

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
accountability of the product owner is

76
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,459
meant to represent now in in in scrum

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,980
product owner is one person not a

78
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,780
committee although they may chair a

79
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,879
committee right I thought that was an

80
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,500
interesting caveat

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,940
um but in in in the world I see lots of

82
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,220
different types of product owners I see

83
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,780
part product owners that are from from

84
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,280
the customer if you're a Professional

85
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,440
Services Company your customer is a

86
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,540
product owner you might have a proxy

87
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,120
product owner that liaisies with that

88
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,920
customer you might have somebody on your

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,200
team who is the product owner who was a

90
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,760
software engineer who is now becoming a

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
product owner you might have somebody

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,659
who was a scrum Master who's now a

93
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,140
product owner you might have nothing at

94
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,840
all right and there's a big gap and how

95
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,120
can you be successful if we're not all

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,099
going in the same direction that that

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,260
Gap is why the product owner is so

98
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,700
essential that

99
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,400
um you need to you need

100
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,400
the way we as humans organize around

101
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,920
solving a problem is we understand that

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,239
problem we work together towards solving

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,299
that problem right we work together

104
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,799
towards a common goal and part of the

105
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,080
the essential nature of the product

106
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:16,799
owner is to to to set communicate uh

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,880
understand set and communicate those

108
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,100
common products Vision strategy goals

109
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,360
that we're going towards so that

110
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,639
everybody

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,380
within the bounds of that product whose

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,880
cares about that product can get behind

113
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,580
it whether those people are customer

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,500
stakeholders or the people who are

115
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,180
actually building the product how are we

116
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,720
all working together towards a common

117
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,000
goal a common Vision a common Direction

118
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,900
um I mean it's it's it's so common that

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,880
you see teams and products and customers

120
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,740
like the team delivers up

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,479
something that the stakeholders are like

122
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,280
what the heck is this and customers are

123
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,979
like we don't like this we're not in

124
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,540
tune we're not all working together

125
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,699
towards a common goal and that's really

126
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,860
the power of the product owner that's

127
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,840
why they're essential
