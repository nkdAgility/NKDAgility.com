1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,400
One of the the big stories around Azure

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,720
DevOps is around governance, security,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,080
compliance, and scalability. And it's

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,599
one of those things that um actually for

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
me is one of the massive value

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,400
propositions of Azure DevOps that a lot

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,039
of those things you just get out of the

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,320
box, right? And that's a really powerful

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,519
story. So I I I

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,199
it's it's a little bit anecdotal but um

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,120
I

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:37,520
teach the um applying professional scrum

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,399
for software developers um and it's a

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,280
program a a a training class where we

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,760
actually set up and use um DevOps

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,760
tooling within the context of of of the

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,320
class and the people participating in

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,239
the class actually work on a on a

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
product uh that paper that's very

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,320
dissolial, right? Um, and they have to

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,120
make changes and they have to do stuff

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
and and and ship product within within a

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,239
short space of time, think 45 minutes,

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
they have to make changes and ship

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,240
product. And there's two there's two

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,000
there's two flavors of that class.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,439
There's the net flavor of the class

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,360
which effectively uses uh um Azure

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,159
DevOps as the back end and then there's

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,600
the open source flavor which you can use

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,159
whatever tools you want but the the the

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,680
the preset up tooling um it takes the

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,759
trainer

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,159
hours and hours to set up and validate

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,720
the environments that they need in order

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
to facilitate the open source class

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,880
because all of the tools don't actually

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,280
talk to each other, right? They don't

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,720
they aren't actually integrated. And

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,759
while in lots of contexts, open- source

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,000
is a great solution to your problem,

42
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,680
sometimes it's the worst solution to

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
your problem. Um, Azure DevOps is

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,240
totally integrated. Um, all the way from

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,320
your automated builds, updating your

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,200
work items so you know which work items

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,600
are in which build output. Um these kind

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,720
of things are invaluable when it comes

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,840
to to traceability. Um inside of Azure

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,520
DevOps, you can turn on it. It has

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,720
logging out of the box, but you could

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,879
turn on additional audit logging and it

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
will tell you exactly who's done what

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
action within the context of Azure

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
DevOps. So somebody's changing your

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,200
process, adding fields, removing fields,

57
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,840
you'll be able to see uh uh who who did

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,480
all of that. So that that governance,

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,080
security, compliance and scalability.

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,080
Again, the Windows team used this with

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,319
15,000 people in one project in uh Azure

62
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,599
DevOps. Um the Azure DevOps team

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,440
themselves are I think they were 900

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
people at one point and the developer

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,720
division at Microsoft is about 5,000

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,440
people. So the these tools have been

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,959
designed to work at scale. While the

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,840
most git repos in the world are in

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,720
GitHub, the largest get repos in the

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,280
world are in Azure DevOps. um as it's

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
the only thing that really um supports

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,040
that type of scale and because it

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,959
integrates fully um with Entra ID um

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,840
because it was designed that way

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,280
that security compliance and scalability

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,440
is just there out of the box, right? So

77
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
you can use all of the things you would

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
expect to be able to use within that

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,280
within that context.

80
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,799
So if you need scalability, security and

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,400
compliance built in,

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,799
let me help you build that in with Azure

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,040
DevOps and apply governance within the

84
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,040
context of your DevOps strategy.
