I work with many enterprise organisations that utilise Azure DevOps, and I often encounter practices that either diminish the effectiveness of its features or, in some cases, break them entirely. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with Dan Helm, the principal product manager for Azure DevOps, about the top issues that users face. Today, I want to share those insights with you, drawing from my extensive experience as a professional Scrum trainer and Microsoft MVP in GitHub and Azure DevOps.

### Understanding Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps was designed by agile teams for agile teams. The product team made a significant shift around 2013, moving from a two-year delivery schedule to a much more agile three-week cycle. As of my last update, they have successfully completed 235 sprints, delivering updates to production with remarkable consistency. This transformation was not without its challenges, especially given the legacy of the Visual Studio Team System (VSTS) days, which catered more to traditional project management than agile practices.

When Microsoft launched Team Foundation Server (TFS) in 2006, the goal was to create a seamless experience for engineering teams, from ideation to delivery, with full traceability. However, the initial implementation was heavily technology-focused, which limited its effectiveness. The transition to the cloud in 2011 marked a turning point, allowing Microsoft to address these limitations and align the tool more closely with agile methodologies.

### The 1ES Vision

The concept of 1ES, or One Engineering System, emerged from this transformation. The aim was to simplify product delivery by ensuring that everyone involved in a project had clear visibility of work items, builds, release environments, and more. Today, Azure DevOps supports a wide range of technologies and stacks, fulfilling the original vision of 1ES. However, as with any complex tool, users often employ it in ways that diverge from its intended use, leading to common pitfalls.

### Top Four Issues in Azure DevOps

Let’s delve into the top four issues that keep the Azure DevOps product team on their toes:

1. **Same-Level Hierarchy**  
   One of the most frustrating practices I see is the creation of a hierarchy of work items that exist at the same level. For instance, when users add product backlog items as children of other product backlog items, it creates confusion and disrupts the intended structure. This misalignment can lead to errors when trying to order items within the same category, as I demonstrated in a recent session. The system simply cannot handle this kind of hierarchy, resulting in frustrating refresh cycles and lost work.

2. **Misuse of Work Item Types**  
   Another common issue is the improper use of work item types. Users often create custom work item types that do not align with the agile framework, leading to a lack of clarity and consistency. This can hinder collaboration and make it difficult for teams to track progress effectively.

3. **Ignoring the Importance of Traceability**  
   Traceability is a cornerstone of agile practices, yet many teams overlook its significance. Failing to maintain clear links between work items, commits, and deployments can lead to confusion and a lack of accountability. It’s essential to ensure that every piece of work is traceable back to its origin, allowing for better decision-making and prioritisation.

4. **Overcomplicating Processes**  
   Lastly, I often see teams overcomplicating their processes within Azure DevOps. While it’s tempting to customise every aspect of the tool, doing so can lead to unnecessary complexity. It’s crucial to keep processes as simple as possible to maintain agility and responsiveness.

### Conclusion

In my experience, the key to maximising the effectiveness of Azure DevOps lies in understanding its intended use and adhering to agile principles. By avoiding these common pitfalls, teams can enhance their productivity and ensure that they are leveraging the full potential of the platform.
