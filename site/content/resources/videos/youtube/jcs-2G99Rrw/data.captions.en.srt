1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:07,319
I work with many Enterprise

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,120
organizations that use Azure devops and

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,840
many of them do things that either

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:16,520
reduce the effectiveness of the features

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,320
or break them entirely I asked Dan Helm

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,039
the principal product manager for aure

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,110
devops what the top four issues were and

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,520
this is the

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,520
[Music]

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,280
result hi I'm Martin hinwood owner and

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,760
principal consultant naked agility I'm a

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,280
professional scrum trainer with

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
scrum.org a professional camand trainer

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,280
with Pro caman and I've been a Microsoft

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,280
MVP in GitHub and Azure devops for 15

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,109
[Music]

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,640
years as your devops in its current

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,239
Incarnation was built for agile teams by

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,920
agile teams the Azure devops product

20
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,439
team transition to Agile around 2013 and

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,920
they moved almost overnight from a

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,280
2-year delivery schedule to one of 3

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,159
weeks as of the time I recorded this

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,240
video they have completed 235 Sprints

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,640
and delivered 235 times to production in

26
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,640
this new

27
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,240
model this was not always the case and

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,479
many of the tools features and

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,920
capabilities which persist assist from

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,320
the visual studio team system days of

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,320
the product are much more relevant for

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,680
companies that are not using agile

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,479
practices when Microsoft created team

34
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,960
Foundation server back in 2006 the

35
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,479
intent was to create a connected

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,159
experience for all of the tools and

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,960
capabilities that an engineering team

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,560
would use the idea was to create a

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,280
holistic connected experience from

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,600
idation all the way through to delivery

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,320
with full traceability of how and why

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,960
things were added however back in 2006

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,560
Microsoft found this to be at odds with

44
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,200
the organization's General Outlook and

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,879
they ended up with a very Microsoft

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,840
Technology only focused

47
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:23,120
system fast forward to 2001 and the move

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,360
to the cloud and suddenly those

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,560
limitations were much more prominent and

50
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,760
needed to be fixed there's a fantastic

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,840
paper from buck hudies director of

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,560
engineering for aure devops on this and

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,640
I'll put a link in the comments

54
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,360
below as Microsoft transformed TFS to

55
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,680
become a cloud product it also addressed

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,239
many of the Microsoft Centric issues

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,680
that it held back its adoption the tool

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,720
started to reflect the original Dream

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,959
and the idea of 1es or one engineering

60
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,400
system was

61
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,080
born the intent of 1es as with the

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,239
original team system was to reduce the

63
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,400
complexity of product delivery by

64
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,680
ensuring that everybody working a

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,840
product knew where their stuff was work

66
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,840
items builds releas these environments

67
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,000
and

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,519
more today as your devop supports any

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,159
technology from any stack and has

70
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,239
enabled that one yes dream however as

71
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,879
with all products users use them in many

72
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,959
ways that were not envisaged by their

73
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,640
creators but with something as

74
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,680
complicated as a your devops there are a

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,280
number of things that users do that go

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,319
against the very intent and paradigms of

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840
the tool

78
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,920
itself I'll show you the top four issues

79
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
that give the Azure devops team

80
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,040
palpitations so the first item that has

81
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,120
the assured devops product team pulling

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,120
their hair out is same level hierarchy

83
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
creating a hierarchy of work items that

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,439
happen to be exactly the same level so

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,400
let's take a look at what that looks

86
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,159
like I'm going to show a simple example

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,920
and then we'll go make a customization

88
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,159
and show show a more complicated example

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,280
so here I have uh my product uh backlog

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:22,880
um I've got my product backlog items uh

91
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,720
I have under here a a t a task which is

92
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,520
a sub item uh so I can quite easily go

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,160
in here and add a new item um I'm going

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,000
to call it a child and I'm going to add

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:41,160
a task uh task to uh click okay you can

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,440
see I uh suck at

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:48,680
that and now I have two uh uh tasks

98
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,280
underneath this item but what I've done

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,840
over here is I have added uh product

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,400
back plug items as children of product

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,680
backlog items so it is represented on

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,720
this board and I should be able to can I

103
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:10,520
still move this around oh I can still

104
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,520
move H this around here but when I go to

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:18,440
try and grab one of these items I can

106
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,400
order it inside of the context oh and

107
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:25,039
there I've managed to break it uh this

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:30,600
is this is why this is a problem uh so

109
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,800
work item uh 40 52 C be ordered because

110
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,520
it's appearent in the same

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
category so if I hit refresh it'll have

112
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,319
gone back to where it

113
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,800
was there we go um so I I was just

114
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,680
trying to order within this category and

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,520
it jumped out and that was the problem

116
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,560
if I go and try and order it over here I

117
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,039
will immediately get that error that's

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,080
the one I was going to show you um and

119
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,440
now I I can't do anything with that

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,240
until I uh refresh and it will go back

121
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
underneath because it has a parent child

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,759
relationship ship you can't order that

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,759
hierarchy I cannot reorder these backlog

124
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,160
items within the context of anything

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
other than this backlog item and in fact

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,160
when I move it to the bottom there it's

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,560
might pop out I might is it going to pop

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,960
out what if I put this one here see it's

129
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,599
not not doing oh there we go I managed

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,599
to uh pop it pop it out there um it's

131
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,199
very easy to do when you have this set

132
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:33,199
up this is not how aure devops is

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:37,199
designed to work at all um so this one's

134
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,479
a a fairly obvious example of of when

135
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,199
this is broken uh but let's go take a

136
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,560
look at what we can do uh to make it a a

137
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,199
little bit less obvious more complicated

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,919
solution what so what I'm going to do is

139
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,800
I'm going to go into the

140
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:54,639
process and I am going to um I've got

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,800
feature disabled let's see what am I

142
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:03,280
going to do uh let's let's create a new

143
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:06,840
backlog item um we're going to call it

144
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,599
uh okr we're going to call it okr just

145
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,160
for fun um and what I'm going to do I'm

146
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
going to make it another color so that

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,680
it doesn't look like it's on the same

148
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,680
level okay so I've added this new item I

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,720
just wanted the default one right so now

150
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,599
I have an okr here oh I don't like that

151
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,319
um oh well The Tick's fine okay so I'm

152
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,560
going to go over to backlog

153
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,479
levels and I'm going to edit this

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
backlog level and I'm going to add okrs

155
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,319
on the same back oh I could do it with

156
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,319
risk as well oo that would be lovely so

157
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm going to add H this in here now I

158
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,759
have okrs and risk at the same level as

159
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,720
this backlog um if you're going to have

160
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,599
work items at the same level that's fine

161
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,800
but it should always be a flat list so

162
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:56,000
now that's all saved if I go back and

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm going to refresh

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,280
this okay so now on this backlog I can

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,879
click new work item and I will have all

166
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,800
of those options I've got um okr risk

167
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,440
bug I have lots of different things so

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,639
let's uh ok

169
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:17,319
R1 add to top OK R2 that's just so that

170
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,960
we remember what we were creating um and

171
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,479
I'm going to do risk and this is risk

172
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,240
one and risk

173
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,080
two okay so this all works great and I

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,159
should be able to order these Within

175
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,000
uh my backlog because my backlog is an

176
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,120
ordered list of work all of the things

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,959
on my backlog should be Tim limited

178
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,680
things that are going to be

179
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,040
delivered but now I've got um some

180
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,760
different things on here now okrs I can

181
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,720
imagine being a Time limited thing that

182
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,040
we're going to deliver and then they'll

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,920
disappear risks we don't really deliver

184
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,600
risks so they should probably never be

185
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,600
on a backlog uh but loads of people will

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,440
what they will try and do is they'll go

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,560
oh I want this

188
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:08,000
risk to be a child of what did we do

189
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,040
here uh Let's do let's do this one again

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,480
just to make it even more dysfunctional

191
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,079
uh we're going to create a new item and

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,720
I create that as a a child I'm going to

193
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,360
add that risk in as your devops will let

194
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,880
you do it as your devops has a the

195
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
underlying work item tracking system

196
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,120
didn't used to have these Adu planning

197
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,040
tools on top and you could do whatever

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,640
you wanted with whatever work item type

199
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,240
under the covers however now I've got

200
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,600
risk as a child of the product backlog

201
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,560
item and I might even think oh can I

202
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,760
even order that oh no I managed to break

203
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,640
it already you can see as soon as you

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,120
start doing uh um some of these things

205
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,680
it's going to get even well it only goes

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,079
up or down I can do that oh it it starts

207
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,880
to work really weird there's loads of

208
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,600
considerations in here the product team

209
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,839
can't take care of everything and you

210
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,399
can even see that it's not doing an

211
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,480
ordered list um as part of this these

212
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,519
items should not oh and it's even doing

213
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,480
very starting to do very weird stuff now

214
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
let me refresh that

215
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,360
again you should not have items that are

216
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,920
at the same level in the backlog as a

217
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,640
parent child relationship with each

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,519
other it's perfectly okay uh to have

219
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,600
different items at the same level so I

220
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,320
might have a bunch of bugs on my boards

221
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,000
that are going to be managed in here

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,079
here along with everything else and I

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,079
can order them with the rest of my work

224
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,839
that makes perfect sense but please try

225
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,279
and avoid having parent child

226
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,600
relationships at the same backlog level

227
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,399
and you'll see at the backlog level here

228
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,440
I have three items at other backlog lels

229
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,480
you might only have one item the easy

230
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,600
way around this is to just have one item

231
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,600
uh but if you do have bugs on the

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,240
backlog you'll also have bugs please

233
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,240
don't do this

234
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,360
the second thing that has the Azure

235
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:11,920
devops team pulling their hair out is

236
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,600
blocked columns or really any temporary

237
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,279
State

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,639
column the expectation for the states on

239
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,440
a work item is that every work item will

240
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,959
move through all of those

241
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,279
States if you create a temporary State

242
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,519
there's a number of process things that

243
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:36,000
become a problem but in reporting you're

244
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,440
going to have columns on your board

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,920
which not all work should pass through

246
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,519
let me show you what I mean so let me

247
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,920
switch to my board here for my

248
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,279
backlog those of you that are cand

249
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,920
minded might have noticed that I forgot

250
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,720
to mention whip

251
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,839
limits if you have uh one of these

252
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,639
temporary State columns like a blocked

253
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,920
column you are effectively hiding whip

254
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,880
whip goes over to a different field alth

255
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
the way is a different colum although

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,480
it's actually in that other column that

257
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,760
it has to go back to and lots of teams

258
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,839
you not deliberately but they hide that

259
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,639
whip over there so they can have more

260
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,560
things in progress cuz this blocked

261
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,160
thing doesn't count that's not how it's

262
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,160
supposed to work the blocked things

263
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,160
still

264
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
count

265
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:40,160
and here I have a customized board so I

266
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:45,079
have new approved um options develop

267
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,760
validate and done every work item on my

268
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:49,639
board is expected to move through all of

269
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,000
these

270
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,320
states uh the the item in new will be

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,800
approved by the product owner the item

272
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,199
that's approved by the product owner

273
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,480
will become an option for the team um

274
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,519
the team will then start working uh

275
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,800
during their Sprint and then they'll

276
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,920
pull things in to develop it it will go

277
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,120
from develop to develop done because

278
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,560
they've completed the development work

279
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,959
and then it will wait wait in this done

280
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,680
uh develop dun column as a wait State

281
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,199
until whoever's doing the validation

282
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,959
perhaps the same people are able to pull

283
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,399
that uh uh item into validate um and

284
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,920
then once the validation has been

285
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,920
successful they're going to drop it into

286
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,760
done that would be the common flow for

287
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,720
all of the work flowing across this

288
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,959
board let me make a little customization

289
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,959
this is the most common one uh that

290
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,440
people add I'm going to

291
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:56,519
add a blocked

292
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:01,040
column um now my first problem is what

293
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,040
state is it blocked in

294
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,959
which of these states is it blocked in

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it's either blocked in the approved

296
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,639
State the new state the approved State

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,040
or the impr progress State uh whichever

298
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,279
one I

299
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,000
pick that might be weird so let me show

300
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,079
you let's say um blocked stuff is kind

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
of outside it's not really in progress

302
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,639
cuz it's blocked but maybe it was in

303
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,959
progress when we blocked it maybe it was

304
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,639
approved from we blocked it how do we

305
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,880
know what state it's supposed to go back

306
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,519
to let me just stick it in the new state

307
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm going to have blocked items on the

308
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:39,000
left hand side of the board there so now

309
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,680
I've got an item in develop here it

310
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,320
becomes blocked so I'm going to move it

311
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,839
into

312
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
blocked and now well actually I think I

313
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,759
messed that up it's still in approved

314
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,759
wow it's gone to approved what did I do

315
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:57,199
wrong uh columns blocked ah I only

316
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,399
changed bug so if I change that to new

317
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
it's actually not going to let is it

318
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,079
going to let me do that

319
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,880
but that item disappears lovely jubly

320
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,480
let's move another item in there you can

321
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,360
see I'm already starting to run into

322
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,800
weird issues now I've put this item in

323
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,360
the blocked column um it becomes

324
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,800
unblocked uh where do I put it which

325
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,040
column does it go to well I can't

326
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,759
remember so I'm going to open the item

327
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,480
I'm going to go to the history and I'm

328
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,319
going to see it was approved and then

329
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,240
push back to new so so now it it was in

330
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,800
approved um so then it becomes an option

331
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,360
uh the team starts working on it and it

332
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,360
gets blocked

333
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,759
again so then we go to unblock it and we

334
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,920
go in we look at the details and now

335
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:51,000
it's gone from uh new to approved to new

336
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,839
to approved to

337
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,480
new

338
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:00,920
okay but we had it in develop so we put

339
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,920
it back in develop open it up

340
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:09,959
well that's H Madness is it in it is it

341
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,040
actually in progress it is in progress

342
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,199
see I am running into lots of issues

343
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,160
already so I'm going

344
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:21,199
to uh I maybe need to refresh my

345
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,480
board there we go and then I'm going to

346
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,399
open up the work item I'm going to go

347
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,839
back to here and there we go now we can

348
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,560
see everything that's going on so it

349
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,399
went from it went to new then to approve

350
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,519
then to new then to approve then to in

351
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,120
progress then to new then into in

352
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,079
progress but in actual fact under the

353
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,880
covers uh you'll see the board column uh

354
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,680
was blocked not blocked blocked not

355
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,759
blocked right oh we could mitigate this

356
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,040
there are some of you out there

357
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,959
screaming well what I would do is I

358
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,959
would go into my

359
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:01,160
process and I would go into

360
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:05,839
my uh put a backlog item I'd go into

361
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,679
States and I'd add like a core state for

362
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,039
this

363
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:14,199
item but now we have exactly the same

364
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:18,039
problem where should this blocked column

365
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,760
go in the core states is it blocked in

366
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:23,319
progress or is it blocked

367
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,880
proposed if it's blocked proposed and it

368
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,760
was in progress we're taking it out of

369
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,200
in progress into proposed if it's

370
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,240
blocked proposed and we put the blocked

371
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,960
column in progress then we're moving it

372
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,080
from proposed to in

373
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,320
progress this is madness this is going

374
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,520
to cause loads of issues this is true

375
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,720
whether you've got a blocked column

376
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,880
uh I don't know what else might you have

377
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:54,400
um on hold um any sort of intermittent

378
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:59,240
state that could appear in any column of

379
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,919
your board what is a much more effective

380
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,400
idea I'm going to remove that nasty

381
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,120
nasty blocked column a much more

382
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,320
effective idea is we create a tag for

383
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,320
blocked if I add a new uh blocked tag

384
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,039
boom save

385
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,919
that and now I can very easily see that

386
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:25,520
this item was blocked and approved I can

387
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,480
see that this item was

388
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,559
blocked in develop and it is very clear

389
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,080
which column they were blocked in how

390
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,039
they were well maybe not how they were

391
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,760
blocked you need to ask some questions

392
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,440
but I know that was blocked in developed

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,720
so I might ask different questions from

394
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,159
it's blocked and approved and when I

395
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,640
want to remove blocked I can very easily

396
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,200
just go remove the tag hit save and now

397
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,320
that item is no longer marked as blocked

398
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,720
now I was able to achieve that uh with

399
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,600
an extra uh annotation here a tag color

400
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,640
blocked his bright red R so that it is

401
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,000
obvious on the board but tagging is a

402
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,960
great way to Mark blocked in addition

403
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,320
that will support other plugins

404
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,039
certainly plugins that I like to use I

405
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,520
have actionable agile uh metrics for uh

406
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,600
predictability around here so there's

407
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:22,440
the actionable agile um tool which gives

408
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,679
you much better graphs on what's going

409
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,799
on with your data it's just loaded the

410
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:31,480
sample data but if I load the Azure data

411
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:34,600
I can load the board history uh go grab

412
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,000
that scrum team I think we were on scrum

413
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,640
Team 2 um and I can

414
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,120
go

415
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,240
I've probably not chosen a board we're

416
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,080
going to load backlog items there we go

417
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,679
it's lit up it's going to go load that

418
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,640
data 34 work items um and I have some

419
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,440
stuff that's changed behind the scenes

420
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,400
uh so I'm going to go take that in

421
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,520
progress State and stick it on here

422
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,360
that's where I want those two items to

423
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,200
exist so now I can model uh this on the

424
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,120
board um it might not have anything

425
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,280
useful on the board because um this is

426
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,360
demo environment uh but if something is

427
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,600
blocked in here you will see the blocked

428
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,200
time in days popping up um and that will

429
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,720
use the blocked um tag and it will not

430
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,400
use a blocked column cand teams should

431
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,559
not ever have blocked columns um that

432
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,280
creates a lot of dysfunctional behaviors

433
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,559
so please try and avoid having a blocked

434
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,080
column and instead opt for a Blog tag

435
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:47,400
with a highlight don't use blocked

436
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,200
columns or any uh temporary State

437
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,280
columns on your board and certainly

438
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,280
don't add it to work items and force

439
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,280
everybody to have

440
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,480
them the third thing that makes the

441
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,080
Azure devops team's toes

442
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,440
curl is too many work item

443
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:14,720
States now work item States exist at a

444
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,080
much lower level in Azure devops than

445
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,039
team choice so when we were looking at

446
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,880
changing columns on a board adding more

447
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,200
columns removing columns that gives

448
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,880
individual teams within the context of a

449
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,279
project lots of flexibility and how they

450
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
want to work what they want to report on

451
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,760
what their workflow is and what they

452
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,720
want to see but lots of organizations

453
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,799
are

454
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,840
incredibly uh uh

455
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:45,520
authoritarian on the way that they do

456
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,600
this and they mandate a bunch of states

457
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,760
for everybody so here I've got an

458
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,000
example I've got a a project here um a

459
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,480
bunch of States has been added and I'm

460
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,080
going to go to my board and suddenly

461
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,799
you'll see this is this is going to be a

462
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,360
problem the column configurations are

463
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:04,880
not correct cuz those columns don't

464
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,960
exist somebody's messed with them and I

465
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,559
need to fix it uh so oh that's the howto

466
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,799
fix it I don't want that I just want to

467
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,600
fix it correct it now and it's going to

468
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,840
pop up that board and now I had my

469
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,279
original approved options develop

470
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,120
validate done and now I've got a bunch

471
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,320
of crazy things in the middle so let's

472
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,320
have a look at what we've

473
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,159
got

474
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,320
okay these are the columns the minimum

475
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:39,520
set of columns I'm now more or less

476
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:45,720
forced to use as a team so if I go into

477
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,720
my admin and I create a new team

478
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:51,840
teams new

479
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,840
team scrum team

480
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,720
three create that I probably need to set

481
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,080
some stuff up so I'll do it now let from

482
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,400
Team

483
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,000
three have I got my iteration yes I've

484
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,760
got a default iteration path let's who

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,559
where what Sprint are we on I can't

486
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,799
remember the dates but let's put

487
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,679
six let's do

488
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,799
that and we have area paths okay we're

489
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:25,600
all good so

490
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:29,400
now I click on boards and I go to my

491
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,880
scrum team 3 board this will be the

492
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,760
default board that every team that uses

493
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,720
this project will get it's massive it's

494
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,200
not only does it barely fit on the

495
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,880
screen in fact it doesn't fit on the

496
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,760
screen I've got to scroll to get let me

497
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,520
zoom out there we go now I've got

498
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,279
everything on the screen at 50% um not

499
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,880
only that uh but adding items to the to

500
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:55,880
the board

501
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,200
um moving them across you can see that

502
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,440
it's going to take H time to move them

503
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:12,080
across all of these states are on that

504
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:17,039
work item it's just an absolute mess now

505
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,720
I can as a team member go in and say uh

506
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,520
I don't want

507
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,679
feedback I don't want

508
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,279
review we're going to have we don't want

509
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,799
design and I don't want initiation we're

510
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,720
going to have new uh uh well is approval

511
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,360
and approved new

512
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,000
approved um and then we're going to have

513
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,080
only one state in so we're going to have

514
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,039
develop uh

515
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,720
um there's a lot of columns in here

516
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,919
let's get rid of that in

517
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,200
progress uh pre-production uat so we're

518
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,000
going to have

519
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,320
this

520
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,919
oh column has two items in it the design

521
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,559
column I can't get rid of oh joy so let

522
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,279
me put these

523
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:07,320
back go and uh I want to remove remove

524
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:10,520
design remove initiation remove remove

525
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,440
remove feedback remove approval I've got

526
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,919
approved develop validate remove in

527
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,440
progress pre there that's a little bit

528
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,159
more manageable a little bit more

529
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,080
manageable but now although I can move

530
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,960
work items through these states you can

531
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,720
see that it added the pre-production

532
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,039
state on there but here it's just

533
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,240
develop and validate but if I go into my

534
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,799
States and somebody moves a work item to

535
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,520
one of the states that doesn't exist on

536
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,399
my board my work item disappears you

537
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,840
need to have all of those States in

538
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,720
order to be able to see all the work

539
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,399
items you could do some mitigating

540
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,159
around making sure that you have queries

541
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:55,279
that show work items that are in states

542
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,000
that you're not using but it just

543
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,440
overloads the team it overloads um the

544
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,440
it doesn't overload the tool you can see

545
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,039
the tool renders it just fine but how do

546
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,559
you find the stuff you're looking for

547
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,799
how do you know what state it's supposed

548
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:12,279
to be in how do you uh move things

549
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:16,799
through that state and if I now add a

550
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,799
bug onto this board

551
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,520
um which the bug only has uh two states

552
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:29,039
you can see it's in approved it's now in

553
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:31,760
New it's now in New New uat

554
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,000
done oh that's that's the bug new and

555
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,120
done it makes it more difficult for

556
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,600
teams it makes it more difficult for

557
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,720
administrators it makes it more

558
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,760
difficult for

559
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,760
collaboration please don't use too many

560
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:56,679
states the fourth thing uh that gets in

561
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:59,240
the way of aure devops is too many work

562
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,159
item types like

563
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,039
why do we need more than a few work item

564
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,960
types it's really common I see this a

565
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:09,000
lot with customers um I know the Azure

566
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,640
devops team talk about this one a lot it

567
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,559
causes a lot of performance issues um

568
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,320
but too many work item types like what

569
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,880
do we need them for I've got I've got an

570
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,279
example here um of too many work I'm

571
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,919
work item types so here's uh my back

572
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:28,640
clog and this back clog has 1 two 3 four

573
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,360
five different work item types here here

574
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,880
technical debt Sprint goal okr user

575
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:39,000
story and hypothesis um I don't know why

576
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,240
you would want this many work item types

577
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,039
all it creates is additional choices

578
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,159
that are a little bit difficult to to

579
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,159
change you you can just change work item

580
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,480
type that is

581
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,080
possible um but why why have so many I I

582
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,440
don't understand it myself I'm going to

583
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,039
show you what I mean if I open up the

584
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:07,240
project here um and I have

585
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:10,480
seen I've made this one um but I have

586
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:13,720
seen uh projects that have this this

587
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,880
many uh work item types I've seen

588
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,559
application change requests compliance

589
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,720
task dependency all of these things I

590
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,159
have seen um perhaps not kitchen sink I

591
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,360
haven't seen kitchen sink um but that's

592
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,399
what it feels like something sometimes

593
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,760
we're going to put everything including

594
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,600
the kitchen sink in here and it serves

595
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,200
to

596
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,720
confuse um and confound people if you

597
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,919
remember some of the previous things we

598
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:46,360
talked about was um uh a hierarchy at

599
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,679
the same backlog level so now I've got

600
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,080
hypothesis okr Sprint gos technical debt

601
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,799
and user story at the same level so now

602
00:28:52,080 --> 00:29:00,880
I can go in here and say well this is my

603
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:04,760
user story and uh let say my Sprint goal

604
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm going to add that user story as a

605
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:14,360
child of that

606
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,360
item um and I'm going to add um

607
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,279
let's and I'm going to add

608
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,399
that as a

609
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,399
parent that

610
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,399
one

611
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,120
and this seems to make perfect logical

612
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,840
sense right I've got some okrs uh that

613
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,480
I'm trying to achieve I'm going to have

614
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,960
this is my goal this Sprint which is to

615
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,919
achieve that okr and then I have user

616
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,640
stories when you have multiple items at

617
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,080
the same level it's definitely much more

618
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,760
likely that this is going to occur uh uh

619
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,720
within a a project or product um and it

620
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,559
just gets confusing because now we can

621
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,480
no longer order those items like you saw

622
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,840
before um we can no longer do other

623
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,320
things with these items uh also you can

624
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,799
see here I've got items at different

625
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,960
levels so here I've got feature has

626
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:10,880
application feature product goal

627
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:13,679
research item and epic has epic which is

628
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:17,399
the default initiative and I added

629
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,120
Kitchen syn in there just for fun um and

630
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,960
then there's a whole bunch of here that

631
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,320
are not associated with any particular

632
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,360
backlog so it's okay to have a few extra

633
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,320
work item types you might add something

634
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:34,399
like um risk to to to to to your backlog

635
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,720
but if it's if we're talking about

636
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:41,080
pieces of work um especially things like

637
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,159
a hypothesis or an okr that might make

638
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:49,159
better sense as a field on your standard

639
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:52,600
work item right the I I could add a new

640
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,639
field in here for the type of user story

641
00:30:52,600 --> 00:31:00,360
and have uh this is this is

642
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:03,480
a an epic this is a Fe this is a a a use

643
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,639
case this is a user story right um

644
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,679
rather than user story being the type I

645
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,039
prefer to have product backlog item and

646
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,960
then add those types to it right how am

647
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:16,919
I breaking down these different uh work

648
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,919
items because I want to do something

649
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:23,000
different with them much more effective

650
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,399
to use a field um and then you never

651
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,039
need to change type from one type to

652
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:29,080
another type so what I want you def

653
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,440
itely want you to do when you're

654
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,960
thinking about

655
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,159
whether you should add a new work item

656
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,000
type is is the reason that you need it

657
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:43,440
painful enough that you have to have it

658
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,840
um Can it just be a tag applied

659
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,880
to a work item that would be the most

660
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,120
optimal fastest quickest easiest

661
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:56,039
cheapest least invasive uh way to do

662
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,960
that next do we need to have a field on

663
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,279
the work item cuz maybe we want to

664
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,240
report on it um don't just put add

665
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,880
fields and report on it because somebody

666
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,880
says they want to report on it um I I

667
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,799
get this a lot awful lot in

668
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,399
organizations where they want to add

669
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,600
custom custom work item types add custom

670
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:20,679
Fields add custom States because they

671
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,159
want to report on it my first question

672
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,679
is always what different choices are you

673
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,679
going to make based on these reports

674
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:30,159
what reports are they going to appear in

675
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,039
and what different choices is the

676
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,320
business or the team going to make based

677
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,480
on that data if they can't answer that

678
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,360
question I I probably not going to

679
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,279
create that work item type I'm not going

680
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,279
to add that extra field there needs to

681
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,480
be a reason for it to be there because

682
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:47,880
it's more to manage it's more to support

683
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,159
it's more for people to do it leads to

684
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,440
more confusion which means you need more

685
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,279
training how do people know what all of

686
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,559
these work item types and extra fuels

687
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,360
and extra states are for what they're

688
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,960
supposed to be for are they using them

689
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,880
correctly who's checking that these

690
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,880
things are all being used correct this

691
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,919
is just a maintenance nightmare it just

692
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,200
doesn't make sense to use too many work

693
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,720
item states don't put the kitchen sink

694
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,240
in that

695
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,480
list that was the top four rookie

696
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,679
mistakes in Azure devops that make the

697
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,919
product team's toes curl if you are

698
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:27,960
finding that you have any of these types

699
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,039
of issues in your environment the

700
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,000
agility can help you or we can help you

701
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,120
find somebody who can don't wait the

702
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,600
longer you leave these types of issues

703
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,900
in place the more expensive it can be to

704
