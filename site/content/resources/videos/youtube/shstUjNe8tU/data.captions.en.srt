00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
migrating legacy systems to the cloud

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,200
can feel like walking a tight rope

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,840
Nobody wants downtime unexpected

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,639
failures and systems grinding to a halt

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,799
But cloud migration doesn't have to be a

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,800
nightmare It's not about lifting and

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,720
shifting everything overnight It's about

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,199
making deliberate well-informed

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,160
decisions that ensure your teams can

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,800
continue working without disruption A

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,840
hybrid cloud approach is often a good

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,880
first step keep critical systems running

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,040
while gradually transitioning workloads

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,120
It's about balancing risk minimizing

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,840
surprise and ensuring the right

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,559
foundations are in place before

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,520
committing fully to the cloud At Naked

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,000
Agility we don't migrate systems for you

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,640
What we do is help you understand your

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,640
systems of work the way that your teams

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
collaborate plan and deliver so that

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,039
when you do move to the cloud you're not

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,480
just shifting problems from one

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,320
environment to the other We guide you

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,799
through structuring your software

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
systems in ways that make them easier to

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,560
change operate and scale over time The

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
key to a seamless cloud transition isn't

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
just technology It's making sure your

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,600
teams are aligned your practices support

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,479
the change and your decisions are made

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,960
with maintainability in mind If you're

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,439
planning a cloud migration don't let it

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,720
become a fire drill Let's talk about how

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
to set up for success
