short_title: 'Cloud Migration: Safe Legacy System Transition'
description: Worried about cloud migration chaos? Discover why a hybrid approach beats “lift and shift” and how to align teams for a seamless, risk-free transition.
tldr: Cloud migration works best when approached gradually, using a hybrid model to reduce risk and avoid simply moving existing problems to the cloud. Success depends on understanding both your technology and how your teams work, aligning people and processes, and focusing on long-term maintainability. Treat migration as an ongoing journey, not a rushed project, and invest in shared understanding and continuous improvement to ensure a smooth transition.

Migrating legacy systems to the cloud is often painted as a Herculean task—fraught with risk, disruption, and the ever-present spectre of downtime. I’ve seen organisations paralysed by the fear of systems grinding to a halt, or worse, the unknown unknowns that lurk beneath the surface of their ageing infrastructure. But let’s be clear: cloud migration doesn’t have to be a nightmare. It’s not about yanking everything out by the roots and hoping for the best. It’s about making deliberate, well-informed decisions that keep your teams productive and your business running.

### Why “Lift and Shift” Rarely Works

There’s a persistent myth that you can simply “lift and shift” your legacy systems to the cloud and call it a day. In reality, this approach often just moves your problems from one environment to another—sometimes amplifying them in the process. The cloud is not a magic wand. If your systems are brittle, hard to change, or poorly understood, those issues will follow you, and may even become more pronounced.

### The Value of a Hybrid Cloud Approach

In my experience, a hybrid cloud approach is often the most sensible first step. Here’s why:

- **Risk Mitigation**: By keeping critical systems running on-premises while gradually transitioning workloads, you avoid the all-or-nothing gamble.
- **Minimising Surprises**: Incremental migration allows you to uncover and address issues early, rather than being blindsided by them after a big-bang move.
- **Building Foundations**: You have the breathing room to put the right practices, processes, and technical foundations in place before committing fully to the cloud.

This isn’t about hedging your bets; it’s about being pragmatic. The goal is to balance risk, maintain business continuity, and ensure that when you do make the leap, you’re landing on solid ground.

### Understanding Your Systems of Work

One of the most common pitfalls I see is organisations focusing solely on the technology. Yes, the technical side matters, but it’s only half the story. The real key to a seamless cloud transition is understanding your systems of work:

- **How do your teams collaborate?**
- **What are the bottlenecks in your current delivery process?**
- **Where does knowledge live, and how is it shared?**

We don’t migrate systems for you. What we do is help you make sense of the way your teams plan, deliver, and operate. The aim is to ensure that when you move to the cloud, you’re not just shifting technical debt and dysfunction from one place to another. Instead, you’re setting yourself up for a future where your software systems are easier to change, operate, and scale.

### Aligning Teams and Practices

Cloud migration is as much about people and process as it is about platforms and pipelines. If your teams aren’t aligned, or if your practices don’t support change, you’re setting yourself up for a world of pain. Here’s what I recommend:

- **Invest in shared understanding**: Make sure everyone knows why you’re migrating and what success looks like.
- **Prioritise maintainability**: Decisions should be made with an eye towards long-term sustainability, not just short-term wins.
- **Support continuous improvement**: Use the migration as an opportunity to refine your ways of working, not just your technology stack.

### Don’t Let Migration Become a Fire Drill

Too often, cloud migration is treated as a one-off project—a mad scramble to meet a deadline, with little thought given to what comes next. This is a recipe for disappointment. Instead, treat migration as a journey, not a destination. Take the time to understand your systems, align your teams, and build the right foundations.

If you’re planning a cloud migration, don’t let it become a fire drill. Let’s have a conversation about how to set up for success—so you can move forward with confidence, not chaos.
