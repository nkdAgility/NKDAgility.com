1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,599
in um evidence-based management we talk

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,719
about multiple areas of um of focus we

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,639
talk about multiple uh key value areas

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,280
and one of those key value areas which

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,600
is really important and most

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,160
organizations and teams forget about is

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,480
unrealized value right they're just as

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,800
important all four of them are as

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,119
important as each other but because this

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,960
is the one that's often forgotten about

11
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,880
um unrealized value

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,280
is features you don't have maybe

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
features you know you need to have but

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,320
you haven't shipped yet maybe there's

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,800
features that you don't know you should

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,480
have and all of those things are driven

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,120
by Mark by the market right and when I'm

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,160
talking about Market um you could

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,079
picture in your head one of two things

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,120
if you deliver to customers general

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
public it's a commercial product then

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,920
your Market might be external to your

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,440
organization if you deliver inside of

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,560
your organization than the market is

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
inside of your organization right so so

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,439
that's what I mean when I say Market the

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,640
the thing the driving forces for what

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,840
your product needs to do right whether

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,479
you fit the market people are going to

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,360
use it people are using the features

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,520
people are engaging with the the things

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,600
that you're doing people care about what

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,400
you're building right that's that's all

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,680
part of that that market story so um

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,840
unrealized

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,360
value means that you don't know you

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,520
don't know necessarily what you need to

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,479
build or even if you think you know what

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,439
you need to build it's based on

40
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,840
assumptions and you don't know what's

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,040
actually going to provide market value

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,079
right was actually value only happens

43
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,240
when you get it in front of real users

44
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,240
everything before that is an assumption

45
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,039
we can try and validate our assumptions

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
we can try and weed out uh bad

47
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,680
assumptions right bad features things

48
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,840
that we don't think oh yeah we've done

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,560
it on paper and it doesn't look like

50
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,000
it's going going to work but the reality

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,959
is that until you get something that you

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,920
think is going to provide value in front

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,040
of real users you don't know whether

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,640
it's going to provide value like if you

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,200
were bu if you were renovating a house

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,720
right are people actually going to buy

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,120
it and are they actually going to pay

58
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,160
the price that you think they're going

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,519
to pay if you have a keen understanding

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,319
of what people are looking for if you

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,519
have a keen understanding of the market

62
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,519
um if you have a keen understanding yeah

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,400
of who's going to who's going to turn up

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,120
and and and potential buyers then you

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,239
can tailor the build of your product

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,760
towards those potential buyers and make

67
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,040
it more appealing for them rather than

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,440
less appealing right so if you're if

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,959
you're renovating a a a house and you're

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,680
you're going for a a family of four

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:06,239
right two kids H don't concrete Over the

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Garden right because the kids want to

73
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,080
play in the grass the kids want to kick

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,440
a ball about a a a back large back

75
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,120
garden with lots of grass looks

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,440
appealing to a family of four right but

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,000
if you've got a a one person house with

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,599
a garden you want that or or a couple

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,400
right a childless couple you you you

80
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,560
want that to be as easy maintenance as

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
possible because they might want to sit

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,080
out in it but they don't want to spend a

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,760
lot of time maintaining it those are the

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,040
things that you're thinking about with

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,040
your products as well who's going to be

86
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,840
using our products what do they want to

87
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,599
do now what do they want to do in the

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,040
future how can we get different users

89
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,200
who who could we get in so that there's

90
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,560
more people using our product what

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,680
features do we have to build to bring in

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,239
net new users to our systems in order to

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,360
um maximize our value

94
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,680
right our product provides more value if

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,319
it serves more users either through a

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,959
commercial relationship or through an

97
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,560
internal providing value inside of the

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,600
organization so that unrealized value

99
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,680
piece is that story and how we engage

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,520
with it we don't know whether things are

101
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,240
going to be successful even if we have

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,000
the coolest idea ever so we want to

103
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,039
break that down I'm a firm believer in

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
hypothesis driven practices from a from

105
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,199
a product management perspective you

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,440
have you have a you have a a a a belief

107
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,720
right that a features going to add value

108
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,080
to the product as a product manager as a

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,680
as a as a leader in the business as a

110
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,759
CEO right I want this feature but we

111
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,479
need to break that down what's your

112
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,639
hypothesis right if we build this

113
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,560
feature what do you think is going to

114
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,560
happen we're going to have more users

115
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,880
okay well how many more users do you

116
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,960
think you're going to have right you

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,000
turn it into a hypothesis um if we build

118
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,520
this feature we think we'll get 10% more

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,280
users okay what's the

120
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,320
smallest thing from this feature that we

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,639
can

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,800
builds in order to start validating that

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,280
hypothesis well we think this is the

124
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,400
most valuable piece well let's let's

125
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,680
build that and see how many users we get

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,280
how many new users come to our platform

127
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,639
because we built this smaller thing and

128
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,639
maybe that's only a few days work to

129
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,919
build that smaller thing to test the

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,880
market to test the hypothesis right I I

131
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,080
what was the the um a great example of

132
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,160
this which is a little bit a little bit

133
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,319
orthagonal is

134
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,639
Dropbox right when when Dropbox um

135
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,840
somebody came up with the idea for

136
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,919
Dropbox I can't remember the dude's name

137
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,479
but he came up with the idea for Dropbox

138
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,800
but his investors didn't believe that

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,000
anybody would want that so he couldn't

140
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,039
get investors nobody would invest in his

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,280
product so he needed to demonstrate

142
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:07,280
that people wanted to buy his product so

143
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,319
they created a pretty cool video it's

144
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,319
probably not pretty cool now but Dropbox

145
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,160
is pretty old a pretty cool video that

146
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,240
that demonstrated the features in a in a

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,800
like selling to a sales video and they

148
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,280
put up the video on the on a website

149
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,440
with a text box for your email

150
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,440
address put your email address in here

151
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,400
if you're interested in this product and

152
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,199
then they spent some money marketing it

153
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,160
and and they got millions of signatures

154
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,080
millions of people put in their email

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,319
address and that was the evidence that

156
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,560
they used to go to the investors to get

157
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,080
them to invest and they got their

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,360
funding uh uh to start building the

159
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,360
product that's an example of we have an

160
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
assumption we think people want this

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,400
product we're going to create a

162
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,479
hypothesis we're going to get lots of as

163
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,080
a that's my crappy hypothesis we're

164
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,160
going to get lots of people if if if we

165
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,160
build this product and then how do we

166
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,360
test well here's one way to test whether

167
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
people are interested in it and we

168
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,160
didn't even have to build the product to

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,080
do it so validating those hypotheses at

170
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,440
every stage and that requires especially

171
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,280
once you built your product and you're

172
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,479
starting to add new features you're

173
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,120
going to be using feature Flags you're

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,199
going to be using uh uh continuous

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,599
delivery to get those features in front

176
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,120
of real users as quickly as possible to

177
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,280
gather feedback gather Telemetry on

178
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,479
whether whether and how people are using

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,960
those products um

180
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:39,879
so your deployment frequency is a huge

181
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:44,159
part of that story because that is the

182
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,400
minimum length your feedback loop can be

183
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:50,680
right so if you deploy once every two

184
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,280
weeks you you can't get feedback shorter

185
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,520
than every two weeks right you're going

186
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
to deploy to

187
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,319
production at the end of the two weeks

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,680
you've then got to recognize a Telemetry

189
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,520
and then you got to get it back into

190
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,440
your story of delivery and you so

191
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,680
usually usually it's twice your

192
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,440
deployment frequency for most things

193
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,240
it's twice your deployment frequency so

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,440
if you do twoe deployments your feedback

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,639
lo as four weeks um getting into

196
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,879
production customer feedback analyze it

197
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,520
get it into your backlog product team

198
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,560
picks it up the shortest that can really

199
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,919
realistically be is twice your your

200
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,919
frequency so if you're deploying to

201
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,279
production continuously if every commit

202
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,680
ends up in production it minimizes that

203
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,880
part of the feedback loop and everything

204
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,599
else is people and people are much

205
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,680
easier to figure out how do we get this

206
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,519
done more quickly than systems because

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,519
systems take a lot of work for that
