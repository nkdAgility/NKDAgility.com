 *Unrealized Value: The Key to Unlocking Future Growth in Product Development*

In *evidence-based management*, one of the *four key value areas* that often gets overlooked is *unrealized value*. Many organizations focus heavily on what theyâ€™ve already built and how to improve existing features, but *what about the value that hasn't been captured yet?*  

In this video, I dive into the importance of *identifying, testing, and validating unrealized value*, and why *your most important features might be the ones you havenâ€™t built yet*.  

 ðŸ“š *Chapters:*
1. *00:00 Introduction* â€“ What is unrealized value and why does it matter?  
2. *02:45 The Role of Market Forces* â€“ Understanding external vs. internal market demands.  
3. *06:30 Why Everything Before Deployment is Just an Assumption* â€“ The reality of feature validation.  
4. *10:15 Hypothesis-Driven Development* â€“ Breaking ideas into measurable experiments.  
5. *15:00 The Dropbox Example* â€“ How a simple video validated a billion-dollar idea.  
6. *18:30 The Power of Feature Flags* â€“ Using controlled rollouts to test value in real-time.  
7. *22:15 Deployment Frequency & Feedback Loops* â€“ Why faster releases mean faster learning.  
8. *26:00 Call to Action* â€“ How Naked Agility can help you maximize unrealized value.  

 ðŸŽ¯ *Who This Video is For:*  
- *Product Managers & Owners*: Wanting to prioritize the right features for maximum value.  
- *Executives & Business Leaders*: Seeking to improve decision-making around product investment.  
- *Engineering & Delivery Teams*: Needing faster feedback loops to validate what users actually want.  
- *Organizations Adopting Agile & Evidence-Based Management*: Looking for strategies to optimize product-market fit.  

ðŸŒŸ *What Youâ€™ll Learn:*  
- *What unrealized value is* and why itâ€™s often ignored in product planning.  
- *Why everything before deployment is based on assumptions*â€”and how to validate them.  
- *How to use hypothesis-driven practices* to test whether a feature is worth building.  
- *Why feature flags and continuous delivery* help minimize the risk of investing in the wrong thing.  
- *How deployment frequency directly affects feedback loops* and why organizations should aim for continuous deployment.  

ðŸ’¡ *Key Takeaways:* 
- *Unrealized value = Features you donâ€™t have yet, but might need.*  
- *Market dynamics should drive product decisions*, whether external (customers) or internal (employees).  
- *Assumptions arenâ€™t facts*â€”real value is only validated when real users engage with a feature.  
- *Hypothesis-driven development reduces risk* by testing small increments before full investment.  
- *Faster deployments mean faster learning*â€”the shorter your feedback loop, the better your product decisions.  

ðŸ”— *Are You Unlocking Your Unrealized Value?*  
At *Naked Agility*, we help organizations *identify, validate, and deliver features that truly matter*â€”so you donâ€™t waste time building things no one wants. Visit *[www.nkdagility.com](https://www.nkdagility.com)* to learn how we can help you *maximize value, minimize risk, and accelerate feedback loops.* Letâ€™s *stop guessing and start learning, together!* ðŸš€
