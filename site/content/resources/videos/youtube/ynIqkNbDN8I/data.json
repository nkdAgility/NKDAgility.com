    "description": "*Unrealized Value: The Key to Unlocking Future Growth in Product Development*\n\nIn *evidence-based management*, one of the *four key value areas* that often gets overlooked is *unrealized value*. Many organizations focus heavily on what theyâ€™ve already built and how to improve existing features, but *what about the value that hasn't been captured yet?*  \n\nIn this video, I dive into the importance of *identifying, testing, and validating unrealized value*, and why *your most important features might be the ones you havenâ€™t built yet*.  \n\n ðŸ“š *Chapters:*\n1. *00:00 Introduction* â€“ What is unrealized value and why does it matter?  \n2. *02:45 The Role of Market Forces* â€“ Understanding external vs. internal market demands.  \n3. *06:30 Why Everything Before Deployment is Just an Assumption* â€“ The reality of feature validation.  \n4. *10:15 Hypothesis-Driven Development* â€“ Breaking ideas into measurable experiments.  \n5. *15:00 The Dropbox Example* â€“ How a simple video validated a billion-dollar idea.  \n6. *18:30 The Power of Feature Flags* â€“ Using controlled rollouts to test value in real-time.  \n7. *22:15 Deployment Frequency & Feedback Loops* â€“ Why faster releases mean faster learning.  \n8. *26:00 Call to Action* â€“ How Naked Agility can help you maximize unrealized value.  \n\n ðŸŽ¯ *Who This Video is For:*  \n- *Product Managers & Owners*: Wanting to prioritize the right features for maximum value.  \n- *Executives & Business Leaders*: Seeking to improve decision-making around product investment.  \n- *Engineering & Delivery Teams*: Needing faster feedback loops to validate what users actually want.  \n- *Organizations Adopting Agile & Evidence-Based Management*: Looking for strategies to optimize product-market fit.  \n\nðŸŒŸ *What Youâ€™ll Learn:*  \n- *What unrealized value is* and why itâ€™s often ignored in product planning.  \n- *Why everything before deployment is based on assumptions*â€”and how to validate them.  \n- *How to use hypothesis-driven practices* to test whether a feature is worth building.  \n- *Why feature flags and continuous delivery* help minimize the risk of investing in the wrong thing.  \n- *How deployment frequency directly affects feedback loops* and why organizations should aim for continuous deployment.  \n\nðŸ’¡ *Key Takeaways:* \n- *Unrealized value = Features you donâ€™t have yet, but might need.*  \n- *Market dynamics should drive product decisions*, whether external (customers) or internal (employees).  \n- *Assumptions arenâ€™t facts*â€”real value is only validated when real users engage with a feature.  \n- *Hypothesis-driven development reduces risk* by testing small increments before full investment.  \n- *Faster deployments mean faster learning*â€”the shorter your feedback loop, the better your product decisions.  \n\nðŸ”— *Are You Unlocking Your Unrealized Value?*  \nAt *Naked Agility*, we help organizations *identify, validate, and deliver features that truly matter*â€”so you donâ€™t waste time building things no one wants.
