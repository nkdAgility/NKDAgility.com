You can, if you have some knowledge and you're missing something, right, you're missing a small piece, you can, uh, uh, uh, fake it till you make it. You can do the thing, like learn as you're going and figure out how to do it better. But if you were, for example, I wouldn't want my neurosurgeon faking it till they make it. I wouldn't want, uh, uh, my plasterer that I'm hiring to do the walls of my house faking it till they make it. Hire expertise, but those experts should be coaching and helping those that don't have skills, uh, or don't have the skills but want them to make them better.
