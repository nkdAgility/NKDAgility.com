1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,000
fake it till you make it fake it till

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,240
you make

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,240
it oh but that

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:19,640
yeah bake it till you make it has its

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,279
limitations you can if you have some

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,199
knowledge and you're missing something

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,160
right you're missing a small piece you

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,720
can uh uh uh fake it till you make it

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,239
you can do the thing like learn as

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,399
you're going and figure out how to do it

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,600
better but if you were for example I

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,039
wouldn't want my neurosurgeon faking it

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,280
till they make it I wouldn't want uh uh

14
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,160
my I wouldn't want my plasterer that I'm

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,440
hiring to do the walls of my house

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,800
faking it till they make it hire

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,199
expertise but those experts should be

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,920
coaching and helping those that don't

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,239
have skills uh or don't have the skills

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,239
but want them to make them better
