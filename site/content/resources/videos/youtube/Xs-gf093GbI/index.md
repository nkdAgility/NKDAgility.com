# What is a product vision and why does it matter?

A strong #productvision is critical for success in a #productdevelopment environment such as #agile or #scrum. It provides inspiration, direction, and guidance on what customers would most value in the product.

If it's that important, how come so few companies do have a product vision? How come it's barely known outside of #agile and #scrum? In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains what a product vision is, why it matters, and how it inspires high-performance product development.
