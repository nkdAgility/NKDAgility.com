## The essence of a Product is 'The Vision'

"What is a product vision and why does it matter?"  🌟

This is a question I've been asked countless times.  And as with many important questions, the answer is both simple and intricate.

Let me share my perspective.

## Journey Without a Destination

Allow me to set the scene for a moment.  Imagine gathering a bunch of people, all set to embark on a mission, all prepped and excited, but here's the twist: no one knows the destination.

Sounds chaotic, right?

This scenario isn't just limited to casual meet-ups.  Even in a business setting, you're in for chaos if there's no vision for your product.  Whether it's something as casual as a pub crawl or as monumental as shaping a new business product, the lack of a clear vision often leads to disorder.

Simply put, if there's no vision, there's no shared understanding of where we're headed.

## Chaos of Multiple Directions

There are consequences of having no Direction, as you could imagine.

Without a vision, individuals will naturally follow their own paths.  Their expertise and skills, as valuable as they may be, could potentially move in directions opposite to what you envisioned.

This misalignment isn't just unproductive.  It can be counterproductive and antagonistic to your goals.

## Defining a Successful Product Vision

There isn't a one-size-fits-all blueprint for a product vision.  🌐 

A product vision is not just a fancy statement or a goal.

I believe a successful product vision resonates when everyone involved with the product clearly comprehends the direction, understands the 'why,' and recognises how their daily contributions fuel the collective journey toward success.  💡 

## Why Do We Need a Product Vision?

Why is a product vision non-negotiable?

 A product vision isn't just about direction; it's about alignment, cohesion, and purpose.  It's about ensuring everyone on board knows the destination and sees their role in getting there.  It's the anchor that keeps all efforts grounded and purposeful.

It's the heartbeat that keeps the product alive and thriving.

For those wanting a deep dive into building and understanding effective product visions, I encourage you to check out our Agile and Scrum courses.

Let's embark on this journey of discovery and alignment together.
