1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,240
that's a great question what is a

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,240
product vision and why does it matter

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,279
if you were getting together with a

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,340
bunch of people

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,180
and you were gonna go do something

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,640
and nobody has any clue what it is you

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,380
want to do they have no clue where

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,080
they're going

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,960
why would you think they would all be

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,940
able to organize together to go in the

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,059
same direction

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,239
whether you're organizing a pub crawl

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,000
or you're organizing your your your your

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,539
your your business around the product

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,260
if there's no vision

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,660
there's no

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,420
understanding of everybody involved in

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,699
where we're going and why

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,900
then there's no way for those people to

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,640
Focus their skills and knowledge and

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,040
capability

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,560
to help you move in that direction right

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,159
they're all going to come up with their

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,500
own story of which direction they want

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,240
to go and they're going to you leverage

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,220
their skills knowledge and expertise and

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,580
going in that direction and it might not

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,520
be it may be antagonistic to to the

29
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,960
direction that you want to take things

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,119
so really a a product Vision I don't

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,380
think there's any one thing that is a

32
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,220
product vision

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:46,020
but I would Define a successful product

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,020
Vision as everybody

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:54,000
working on or with the product

36
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,860
understands where we're going why and

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,960
how the things that they're doing every

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,259
day contribute towards that overall

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,020
success that's a product vision and

40
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,060
that's why we need one

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,860
