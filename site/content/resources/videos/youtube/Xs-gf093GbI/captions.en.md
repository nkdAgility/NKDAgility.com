That's a great question. What is a product vision and why does it matter? 

If you were getting together with a bunch of people and you were gonna go do something and nobody has any clue what it is you want to do, they have no clue where they're going. 

Why would you think they would all be able to organise together to go in the same direction? 

Whether you're organising a pub crawl or you're organising your business around the product, if there's no vision, there's no understanding of everybody involved in where we're going and why. 

Then there's no way for those people to focus their skills and knowledge and capability to help you move in that direction. Right? 

They're all going to come up with their own story of which direction they want to go and they're going to leverage their skills, knowledge and expertise in going in that direction, and it might not be— it may be antagonistic to the direction that you want to take things. 

So really, a product vision— I don't think there's any one thing that is a product vision, but I would define a successful product vision as everybody working on or with the product understands where we're going, why and how the things that they're doing every day contribute towards that overall success. 

That's a product vision and that's why we need one.
