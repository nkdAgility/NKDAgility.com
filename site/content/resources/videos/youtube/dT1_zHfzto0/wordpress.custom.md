## The Reality of Scrum Adoption 🤔  

Ken Schwaber once declared that a staggering 75% of organisations utilising Scrum won't reap the benefits they anticipate.  

But let's take a moment, step back, and consider: could it be even higher? 😮 

In this candid reflection, I argue that perhaps 90% of organisations might fall short in their Scrum journey.  

Why? Let's delve deeper

## Why Organisations Miss the Mark: A Deeper Look 🎯  

The crux of the issue lies in focusing solely on the team-level mechanisms of Scrum without acknowledging the broader organisational changes necessary. Here, it's critical to embrace a more holistic approach. 

- **Mechanisms over Mindset 🔄**: Many organisations fixate on Scrum ceremonies and artefacts but neglect the underlying agile mindset. 

- **Holistic Change is Essential** **🌐**: Implementing Scrum isn't just about the teams; it’s about adapting the entire organisation to support regular, customer-focused delivery. 

## The Importance of a Holistic Approach **💡**  

Scrum isn't merely a set of meetings or a to-do list. It's an ethos, a shift in perspective that necessitates embracing change from the ground up. 

- **Extend Beyond the Team** **👥**: Successful Scrum adoption extends its principles beyond the development team to the entire organisation. 

- **Regular Cadence for Customers** **📆**: It’s about establishing a rhythm and regular cadence of delivering valuable products to customers. 

## How to Ensure You're in the Successful 10% ✅  

Ensuring your organisation falls into the successful 10% is challenging yet achievable. Here’s how: 

- **Adopt an Agile Mindset** **🧠**: Start with a shift in mentality, not just processes. 

- **Management Buy-In** **👩‍💼**: Secure support and understanding from management to facilitate holistic change. 

- **Continuous Improvement** **⏩**: Regularly assess and adapt your processes and approach. 

## Elevating Your Scrum Journey 🚀  

Ken’s assertion provides a sobering perspective on Scrum adoption. However, by focusing on a holistic transformation and customer-centric delivery, organisations can defy the odds and join the successful minority.
