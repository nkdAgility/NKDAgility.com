So Ken once said that 75% of organisations at using Scrum will not succeed in getting the benefit they hope from it. Um, and I don't agree with them. I think it's 90% of the organisations that adopt Scrum will not get the benefits they hope from it. And it's because they focus on the mechanisms of Scrum at the team level, and they don't broaden that out to the holistic organisational changes that are required to support actually delivering software and products on a regular cadence for your customers.
