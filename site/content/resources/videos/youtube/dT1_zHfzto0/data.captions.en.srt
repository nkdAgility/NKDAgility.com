00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,680
so Ken Ken once said that 75% of

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,480
organizations at using scrum will not

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,960
succeed in getting the benefit they hope

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,920
from it um and I don't agree with them I

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,560
think it's 90% of the organizations that

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,400
adopt scrum will not get the benefits

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,119
they hope from it and it's because they

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,800
focus on the mechanisms of scrum at the

9
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,599
team level and they don't broaden that

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,679
out to the holistic organizational

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,559
changes that are required to support

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,600
actually delivering software and

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,520
products on a regular Cadence for your
