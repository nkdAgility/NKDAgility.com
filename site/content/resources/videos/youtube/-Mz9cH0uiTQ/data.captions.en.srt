1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,179
so the question was does a client

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,280
tell an agile consultant of what they

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,519
need or does it work the other way

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,519
around

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,980
I think it works the other way around

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,980
but I think it's more complicated than

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,160
that because

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,619
a lot lots of clients come with

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,640
an agenda

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,460
so quite often you come in under a

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,180
particular agenda

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,739
but the mark of a great consultant is

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,200
you

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,120
are trying to deliver the maximum value

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,840
to the customer right

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,879
so you have to figure out regardless of

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,760
what they've asked for

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,940
what is it that they need

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,640
for for them to be successful in

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,379
whatever is that they're trying to do

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
or even is the thing they're trying to

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,420
do the right thing that they're trying

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,180
to do

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,580
and then slowly convince them to do the

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,840
right thing so I guess it depends how

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,720
long you're going to be engaged with the

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,060
customer for what that really looks like

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,939
I'm quite often engaged with customers

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,400
for a short period of time

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,700
um most of my engagements with customers

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,040
have either been over uh uh uh two or

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,960
three weeks that's generally they want

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,820
advice they're like we want to

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,979
understand how we do something and I'm

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,900
coming in giving them advice and then

36
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,299
they're taking it forward I'm not not

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,240
working with them to do it but I've also

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,540
done longer engagements but usually for

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,920
Professional Services teams where I'm

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,020
working with lots of different teams

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,180
inside of their organization so it's

42
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,460
like I'm internally Consulting with lots

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,460
of different teams and I would come in

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,799
and help observe give them some feedback

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,020
usually working with their scrum master

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,000
so

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,680
when when they come they want a

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,020
particular thing

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,459
right they want to

50
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,160
um usually actually they want to get

51
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,040
better at this agile thing

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,920
but that's not necessarily like getting

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,080
being awesome at agile what value does

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,400
that provide the company what values

55
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,800
that provide their customers it's not

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,180
necessarily the right thing but that's

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,760
what they ask for because that's the

58
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,800
trend right so you quite often come in

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,599
under that that guys but then you've got

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,180
to figure out what is it that this

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,180
organization actually needs is it is it

62
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:39,300
is it a a a leadership

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,340
um issue where you need to focus on

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,040
um that that that whole engagement

65
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,720
pipeline that they're working through

66
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,720
um I did an engagement recently with a

67
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,060
professional services company and

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,560
they were they'd built up this this this

69
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,440
great business and

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,379
it was I I have a weird name for it I I

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,000
call it the death spiral of Consulting

72
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,040
um and it's it's where you get a little

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,360
bit too big

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,700
um and

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,200
you need to feed the monster which is

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,940
that your business

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,200
so you have very aggressive sales

78
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,700
tactics you've built a great name in the

79
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,640
industry you're very aggressive sales

80
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,459
tactics you bring in

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,620
um uh more you have to hire more people

82
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,120
to get the gigs done because you've got

83
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,060
these aggressive sales tactics that

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,159
bring in lots of gigs and then

85
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,959
you need to do them now and you get more

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,159
gigs than people so you have to hire

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,780
more people

88
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,980
and because you have to hire them

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,860
quickly because you've told the customer

90
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,480
you can do it you're not waiting for the

91
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,860
top tier candidates you're getting the

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,379
people that are available

93
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,180
and then they're doing the gig

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,980
and then you need more gigs because

95
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,720
you've now got a bigger head count and

96
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,519
more people so you have more aggressive

97
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,620
sales Tactics get in more gigs and then

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,720
oh all our people are busy we need to

99
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,159
hire more people and then even those

100
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,200
level of people are not available at the

101
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,760
next level down and you end up in this

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,680
death spiral of taking on too much work

103
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,400
when what they really need is a whip

104
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,500
limit right they need to control their

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
sales pipeline it's not a free-for-all

106
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,780
it's uh what can your business safely

107
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,479
handle to deliver the level of quality

108
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,919
that your customers are looking for and

109
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,479
I think this is true not just for

110
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,759
Professional Services this is true in

111
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:28,680
any business what is the level of

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,300
quality and brand and uh uh uh

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,580
um visual that you're trying to get from

114
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,199
your customer your customers

115
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,699
and what's the maximum amount of

116
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,560
business you can do while safely

117
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,259
maintaining that and then you want to

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,020
grow slowly while maintaining that level

119
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,880
of quality so you're hiring the right

120
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,160
people you're

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,020
um engaging on the right engagements

122
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
right you're not taking any engagement

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,800
that comes along because probably any

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,220
engagement sucks you're picking and

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,220
choosing which engagement at that level

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,500
um so I think most customers don't know

127
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,479
what they want

128
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,699
um they think they want this agile thing

129
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,919
or this devops thing

130
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,040
and can you come and install it for us

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,380
but you have to figure out what it is

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,540
that is the actual

133
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,759
um difficulty the thing that they need

134
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,220
help with and help them with that even

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,740
if it's kind of surreptitiously or kind

136
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,840
of around a different way so that they

137
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,740
feel like and and really do get value

138
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,740
