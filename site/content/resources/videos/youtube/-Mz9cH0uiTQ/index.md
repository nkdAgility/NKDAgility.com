When I’m engaged as an agile consultant, I often find myself pondering a fundamental question: does the client dictate what they need, or is it my role to guide them towards the right solutions? My experience has led me to believe that it’s the latter, but the reality is often more nuanced.

### Understanding Client Needs

Clients frequently arrive with a specific agenda. They might have a clear idea of what they want, but as a consultant, my job is to dig deeper. It’s essential to uncover what they truly need to succeed in their endeavours. This often involves:

- **Assessing the Situation**: What are the underlying issues? Is the project they’re pursuing genuinely the right one?
- **Delivering Value**: My focus is on providing maximum value, even if it means steering them away from their initial requests.

The duration of my engagement can significantly influence how this process unfolds. Most of my work tends to be short-term, spanning two to three weeks. During these periods, clients typically seek advice on how to implement agile practices effectively. I provide insights and strategies, which they then take forward independently.

However, I’ve also had the opportunity to engage in longer-term projects, particularly with professional services teams. In these cases, I work closely with various teams within the organisation, often collaborating with their Scrum Masters to observe and provide feedback.

### The Agile Misconception

A common misconception I encounter is the desire to simply "get better at agile." While this is a popular trend, it doesn’t always translate into tangible benefits for the organisation or its customers. The real question is: what value does this improvement bring? 

In one recent engagement with a professional services company, I encountered what I call the "death spiral of consulting." This phenomenon occurs when a company grows too quickly, driven by aggressive sales tactics. Here’s how it typically unfolds:

1. **Aggressive Sales**: The company builds a strong reputation and begins to attract more clients.
2. **Hiring Frenzy**: To meet demand, they hire rapidly, often compromising on candidate quality.
3. **Overcommitment**: With more projects than available talent, the quality of work begins to suffer.
4. **Reinforcing the Cycle**: The need for more gigs leads to even more aggressive sales tactics, perpetuating the cycle.

### Finding the Right Balance

What’s crucial for any business, not just professional services, is understanding the balance between quality and quantity. Here are some key considerations:

- **Quality Control**: What level of quality do you want to maintain? This should dictate how much work you take on.
- **Sustainable Growth**: Aim for gradual growth that allows you to maintain quality. This means hiring the right people and selecting the right projects.
- **Selective Engagement**: Not every opportunity is worth pursuing. It’s vital to choose engagements that align with your business values and capabilities.

### The Real Challenge

Most clients don’t truly know what they want. They may think they need agile or DevOps implementations, but the real challenge often lies elsewhere. My role is to help them identify these core difficulties, even if it means approaching the solution from an unexpected angle. 

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure they derive genuine value from our collaboration. It’s about guiding them towards the right path, even if it requires a bit of finesse.

If you found this discussion insightful, I encourage you to engage with me further. Whether you have questions about agile, Scrum, or DevOps, or simply want to chat, feel free to book a coffee with me through Naked Agility. Your thoughts and comments are always welcome!
