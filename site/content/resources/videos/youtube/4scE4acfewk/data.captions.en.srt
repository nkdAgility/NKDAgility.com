1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,559
one of the Seven Virtues Of agile is

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,440
humility we need to

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:14,320
realize especially product owners and

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,840
product managers that the things we

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,920
expect to be valuable or the things that

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:22,840
we think are valuable are not always the

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,960
things that are actually valuable that

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,640
just because it's our idea um and our

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,960
thinking doesn't mean um that it's going

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,600
to be successful and that's true for the

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,879
product owner thinking about ideas and

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,360
the product um it's also true for for

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:43,200
developers right people doing the work

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,280
thinking that their idea is the best how

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
do you collaborate as a team do you

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,800
collaborate with um

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,920
arrogance and I'm always right and

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,399
you're always wrong or do you

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,120
collaborate with humility here's my idea

20
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,559
and maybe it's a good one maybe maybe

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:08,320
it's not let's discuss right bringing um

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,840
modesty and respect for others into the

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,080
conversation in agility is going to help

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,640
you build trust right build those

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,400
empathetic relationships both within the

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,200
team within the organization and

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,320
Leadership and outwardly towards

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,240
customers don't make

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,119
assumptions right that's the the the key

30
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,680
risk here is making assumptions um and

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,200
also cognitive bias although that's more

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,320
difficult to detect in yourself usually

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,640
you need somebody else to to to look in

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,840
on it to to point it out um but then do

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,560
you listen to those people do you

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,479
realize that perhaps other people's

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
perceptions um are are are are important

38
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,920
to our decision making I'm not saying

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,159
blindly listen to what other people say

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,680
right um I'm saying we need to take that

41
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,439
into consideration so in order in the

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,320
product world in the product management

43
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,320
world to

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:18,800
be being H humble having humility we

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,200
need to be looking at how people see our

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,360
ideas and see our product how they see

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,280
us we need to be looking at the data

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,560
right there are facts in this story but

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,160
you know we can interpret as lies damn

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,959
lies and statistics right we can

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,480
interpret facts differently but having

52
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,959
those facts to hand how are people using

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,360
the features in our product um how are

54
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,000
they engaging how do how do the people

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,200
on our teams feel about the way that we

what's their morale like um having that

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
data to hand will help us make better

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,840
decisions and we need the humility to

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,840
look at the results to listen to what

62
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,799
people say and perhaps make a change to

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,200
the way we do things because we're not

64
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,840
always right if you are having

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,720
