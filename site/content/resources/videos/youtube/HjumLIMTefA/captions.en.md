One of the huge impacts of immersive learning is the impact that it has on the organization because the participants are going back to their organization and trying things and then getting feedback on it and perhaps trying slightly different again to try and make it work. That act of continuous learning and continuous change enables actual change to happen in the organization, which is the reason that we go to training in the first place, so that we can enact actual change. Immersive learning is the best chance for organizations to make actual change.
