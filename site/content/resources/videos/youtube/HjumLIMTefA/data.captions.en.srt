1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,799
one of the huge impacts of immersive

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,600
learning is the impact that it has on

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,240
the

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,880
organization because the participants

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,839
are going back to their organization and

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,840
trying things and then getting feedback

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,600
on it and perhaps trying slightly

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:24,480
different again to try and make it work

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,039
that act of um

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,800
continuous learning and continuous

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,680
change enables actual change to happen

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,000
in the organization which is the reason

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,239
that we go to training in the first

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,800
place so that we can enact actual change

15
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,039
and immersive learning is the best

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,760
chance for organizations to make actual

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,760
change
