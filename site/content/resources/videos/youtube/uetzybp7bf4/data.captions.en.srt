1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,000
if you want to maximize your return on

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:09,920
investment for the time and effort that

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,280
that people put into into into the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,680
products that you're

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:20,080
creating you need to try and enable

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,920
Foster a culture where the people that

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,720
are working within the context of your

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,439
your

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,400
products care about the products and

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,039
your customers right they care about

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,160
what it is that they're creating because

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,480
because they feel that they have own

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,120
people care about things they have

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,360
ownership of right so there are a whole

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,440
bunch of ways you can do that you're

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,680
effectively fostering a culture of

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,280
continuous Improvement kind of a little

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,960
bit of Buzzard Bingo there right but the

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,039
idea is that we when we talk about

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,840
hypothesis driven practices we we're

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,160
having an idea we're trying a little bit

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,559
of that idea we're getting feedback from

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,840
the customer and then we're adapting

24
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,880
that idea to be better so it's it's

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,320
double down right we're going to invest

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,640
more in this because it looks like it's

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,960
awesome we've got pivot which is we we

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,159
change what we're doing based on what we

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,479
learn or we've got kill it which is stop

30
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,799
investing in it and do something else

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,640
like don't keep keep doing this you see

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,400
Google Google are doing this a lot

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,360
there's there's two websites there's uh

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,159
Microsoft graveyard and Google graveyard

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
it's product that Microsoft and Google

36
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,079
have killed right over the years some of

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
them are very high profile some of them

38
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,079
are are lesser known right and it's

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
about the more high-profile it is

40
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,119
probably it's been invested more Money's

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,320
been invested in it and more people

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,799
liked it but not enough people it didn't

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,399
make enough of an impact to continue to

44
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,640
invest it for the cost uh uh uh that it

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,200
is

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,200
so if we

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,479
want the people that are doing the

48
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:09,879
work to care

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:13,879
about our product to care about our

50
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,280
customers and to spend money which is

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,640
their time right that's their time

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,000
they're every time they do something

53
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,400
they're spending your money right every

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
person in your organization is spending

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,640
your

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,080
money if we want them to spend that

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,680
money ah diligently I don't like that

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,120
word with

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,680
care then they need

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,480
to understand the

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
context within which they make that

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,599
decision about whether they do this

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,000
thing or they do not do this thing or

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,000
they do it this way or they do it that

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,560
way right so in order to do that and

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,800
this is something that I see lots of

67
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,080
organiz there's a a I consider it a

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
little bit of a dysfunctional behavior

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,040
that I see lots of organizations doing

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
especially Professional Services

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,400
organizations but also uh product

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
organizations as

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,720
well they

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Shield the people doing the work from

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,640
the finances of doing the work because

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,560
it's all shifted off to a finance

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,519
department right departmental

78
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,560
finance and what that does is remove the

79
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,360
context of

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,439
money from the people doing the

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,120
work imagine you trying to run your

82
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,319
business and make decisions about what

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,760
you're going to invest in and what

84
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,239
you're not going to invest in but you

85
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,239
had no information about budget you had

86
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,640
no information about money you had no

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,760
information about spend you had no

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,040
information about

89
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,280
Revenue how good are you going to be at

90
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,400
making successful decisions to make a

91
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,000
successful business if you don't have

92
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,360
access to any of that information it's

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,959
going to suck right you you're going to

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,280
make bad decisions because you don't

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,360
have all the information that's every

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,840
member of every team in your

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,519
organization they're they're right now

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,640
they're potentially making bad decisions

99
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,959
about what features they build about how

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,799
they build those features because they

101
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,600
don't understand the ROI effectively of

102
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,680
what it is that they're they're they're

103
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,400
doing because they might might think

104
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,280
it's going to provide value but do they

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,639
actually know and do they know what it

106
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,080
costs to

107
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,880
make I'd

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,680
advocate for every team doing their own

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,720
p&l

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,919
right what value are you as a team

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,639
bringing the

112
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:45,360
business what do you

113
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,039
cost I want value to be higher than the

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
cost right if you're a team and you're

115
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,680
thinking about those things you're going

116
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
to make different decisions because you

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,039
have additional context you turn every

118
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,479
member of every team into an

119
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,320
entrepreneur

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,120
trying to figure out how do we maximize

121
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,199
we're doing this work within the context

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,199
of this product how do we maximize the

123
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,720
value that we return what should we be

124
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,840
working on well we should be working on

125
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,440
this stuff over here because that's

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,039
going to give us the biggest return

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,919
right biggest short-term return biggest

128
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
long-term return right because when

129
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,960
you're thing you as a business owner you

130
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
as a CTO or CEO are thinking about how

131
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,960
you invest in your company you're

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,440
thinking about shortterm wins to

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,800
generate Revenue quickly you're thinking

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,000
about the longterm objective of the

135
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,240
business and how you're going to make

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,199
money in the long term and

137
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,120
sustainable income right and and that's

138
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,280
all part of the story it needs to be for

139
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,800
every member of every team you can't if

140
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,639
you hide that information from them if

141
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,680
you obuse it and create a a a a filter

142
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,720
so they don't see any of that stuff

143
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,280
they're going to make bad decisions so

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,800
don't Shield them from that build that

145
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,400
into the story of how a team

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,840
operates do p&l with every team have

147
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,240
that filter up through the organization

148
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,479
and I guarantee you'll see higher return

149
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,000
on investments and higher value being

150
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,000
delivered
