    "final_score": 17.0,
    "reasoning": "The content focuses on moving beyond output-based metrics and fostering value-centric Agile cultures. However, it lacks any discussion of autonomous AI agents, context-aware intelligence, agentic integration, or the transformation of delivery models toward agentic approaches. Though 'value delivery' is discussed, the topic is rooted in well-established Agile practices and psychological safety, not in agentic methods or AI-enabled delivery. The audience and themes overlap slightly with modern software delivery, but the core attributes of Agentic Software Delivery are entirely absent, resulting in a low confidence score.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content covers Agile value delivery and psychological safety but does not discuss agentic practices, AI agents, or contextual intelligence—making it a poor match for the Agentic Software Delivery category.",
    "level": "Ignored"
