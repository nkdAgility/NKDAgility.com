If you are working in the agile space and you're focused on, say, do metrics like original estimate versus actuals, then you are an agile Bandit. You want to stop doing that. It reduces the psychological safety of your team. It creates a focus on estimation rather than actually delivering stuff, and it encourages teams to focus more on the output—more stuff being delivered—than the outcomes that they're trying to achieve. Don't be an agile Bandit and don't use S do metrics.
