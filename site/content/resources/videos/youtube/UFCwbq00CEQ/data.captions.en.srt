00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,399
if you are working in the agile space

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:10,160
and you're focused on say do metrics

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,839
like original estimate versus actuals

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,759
then you are an agile Bandit you want to

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,480
stop doing that it reduces the

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,199
psychological safety of your team it

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,679
creates a a focus on estimation rather

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,519
than actually delivering stuff and it

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,599
encourages teams to focus more on the

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,520
outp put more stuff being delivered than

11
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,440
the outcomes that they're trying to

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,680
achieve don't be an adual Bandit and

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,680
don't use S do metrics
