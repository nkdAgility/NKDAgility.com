In the world of Agile, I often encounter a troubling trend that I like to call the "Agile Bandit" mentality. If you find yourself fixated on metrics such as original estimates versus actuals, it’s time for a serious rethink. This approach not only undermines the very principles of Agile but also diminishes the [psychological safety]({{< ref "/tags/psychological-safety" >}}) of your team. 

### The Dangers of Focusing on Estimates

When teams concentrate on [estimation]({{< ref "/tags/estimation" >}}) metrics, they inadvertently shift their focus away from what truly matters: delivering value. Here’s why this is problematic:

- **Psychological Safety**: Constantly measuring against original estimates can create an environment of fear and anxiety. Team members may feel pressured to meet arbitrary numbers rather than focusing on collaboration and innovation.
  
- **Output Over Outcomes**: By prioritising the amount of work completed (output) rather than the value delivered (outcomes), teams risk losing sight of their goals. Agile is about delivering customer value, not just ticking boxes on a to-do list.

- **Encouraging a Blame Culture**: When estimates become the yardstick for success, it can lead to finger-pointing and blame when things don’t go as planned. This is the antithesis of the collaborative spirit that Agile promotes.

### Shifting the Focus

So, how do we move away from this Agile Bandit mentality? Here are some strategies that I’ve found effective:

- **Emphasise Outcomes**: Shift your team’s focus from output to outcomes. Ask questions like, “What value are we delivering to our customers?” and “How can we measure success in terms of impact?”

- **Foster a Safe Environment**: Create a culture where team members feel safe to share their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgement. Encourage open discussions about challenges and celebrate learning from failures.

- **Use Meaningful Metrics**: Instead of relying on traditional estimation metrics, consider using metrics that reflect the value delivered, such as [customer satisfaction]({{< ref "/tags/customer-satisfaction" >}}) scores or the impact of features on user engagement.

### My Personal Experience

In my own journey through Agile transformations, I’ve seen teams flourish when they abandon the fixation on estimates. One team I worked with shifted their focus from tracking original estimates to measuring customer feedback and engagement. The result? They not only delivered higher-quality products but also fostered a more collaborative and innovative environment.

### Conclusion

Don’t be an Agile Bandit. Let go of the outdated metrics that hinder your team’s potential and embrace a mindset that prioritises [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}}) and psychological safety. By focusing on outcomes rather than estimates, you’ll create a more engaged, motivated, and successful team. Remember, Agile is not just about doing things faster; it’s about doing the right things that truly matter.
