One of the seven signs of the agile apocalypse are plagues. Um, and there are a number of plagues, but one that really kills my goat is tools and process becoming sacrosanct within the team. That's a plague on agile and agility. You can't be agile; you can't have agility if you're not willing to continuously adapt and have your processes, practices, and tools emerge over time. If you're stuck on one thing or you're forcing people to use one way of doing something, then I'm afraid that is one of the seven signs of the agile apocalypse plagues.
