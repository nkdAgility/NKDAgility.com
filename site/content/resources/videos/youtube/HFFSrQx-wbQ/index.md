# Plague - 7 Harbingers agile apocalypse. But shorter!

Sometimes, that passion is well thought through and justified. At other times, it's fueled by a desire to capitalize on high day rates for an #agilecoach. Unfortunately, it's more often the latter rather than the former that fuels the noise around #agile.

In today's session, Martin Hinshelwood explores the plague of unskilled, inexperienced, and unprofessional self-proclaimed #agile coaches.
