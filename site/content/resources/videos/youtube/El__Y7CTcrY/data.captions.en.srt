1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,400
one of the reasons I love the immersive

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:07,360
learning experience for students is the

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,000
fact that they don't get

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,080
indigestion there are a lot of things

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,080
that we talk about during the classes

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,279
quite often people talk about drinking

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,439
from the fire hose um but if you if you

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,080
actually imagine a fire hose hitting

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,160
somebody they get knocked off their feet

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,199
and that's sometimes what it feels like

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,000
with the amount of information in the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,680
very short space of time um that we have

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,399
generally for the 2-day classes so what

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,559
I love about the immersive classes is

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,120
that there's there's less indigestion

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,000
there's more bite-sized pieces and you

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,000
get time to chew
