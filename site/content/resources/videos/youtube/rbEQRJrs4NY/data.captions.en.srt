1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,000
value only happens when you get it in

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,120
front of real users everything before

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,040
that is an assumption we can try and

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,639
validate our assumptions we can try and

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,480
weed out uh uh bad assumptions right bad

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,519
features things that we don't think oh

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
yeah we've done it on paper and it

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,760
doesn't look like it's going going to

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,039
work but the reality is that until you

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,240
get something that you think is going to

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,960
provide value in front of real users you

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,039
don't know whether it's going to provide

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
value like if you were bu if you were

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,360
renovating a house

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,920
right are people actually going to buy

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,239
it and are they actually going to pay

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,280
the price that you think they're going

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,640
to pay if you have a keen understanding

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,440
of what people are looking for if you

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,680
have a keen understanding of the market

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,680
um if you have a keen understanding yeah

22
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,559
of who's going to who's going to turn up

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,280
and and and potential buyers then you

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,359
can tailor the build of your product

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,879
towards those potential buyers and make

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,719
it more appealing for them rather than

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,719
less appealing
