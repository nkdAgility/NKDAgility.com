Value only happens when you get it in front of real users. Everything before that is an assumption. We can try and validate our assumptions; we can try and weed out bad assumptions, right? Bad features, things that we don't think, "Oh yeah, we've done it on paper," and it doesn't look like it's going to work. But the reality is that until you get something that you think is going to provide value in front of real users, you don't know whether it's going to provide value.

Like if you were renovating a house, right? Are people actually going to buy it, and are they actually going to pay the price that you think they're going to pay? If you have a keen understanding of what people are looking for, if you have a keen understanding of the market, if you have a keen understanding of who's going to turn up and potential buyers, then you can tailor the build of your product towards those potential buyers and make it more appealing for them rather than less appealing.
