    "reasoning": "This content focuses exclusively on the value of real user feedback in product development, emphasizing the importance of engaging with actual users to validate assumptions. However, it never references AI, human-AI partnership, or the emergence of enhanced cognitive capabilities through collaboration with AI agents. The primary context is traditional human-centered product development practices, with no mention or implication of human-AI teaming or collective intelligence as defined by the category. Scores are necessarily low across all dimensions, with conceptual alignment and depth scoring barely above zero only in so far as human feedback is a prerequisite for any collective system, but the lack of any reference to AI collaboration ensures almost total irrelevance to the category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content addresses user feedback in product development, but it does not discuss human-AI collaboration, AI agents, or collective intelligence. It is focused strictly on traditional human-driven practices, making it a very poor fit for the 'Collective Intelligence' category.",

While there is an emphasis on iterative feedback, adaptation, and value creation, there are no explicit mentions or in-depth discussions of OKRs, their framework, or related principles as articulated by John Doerr. Key topics such as Objective/Key Result separation, strategic alignment through OKRs, or measuring success via OKRs are completely absent. Although some themes (like continuous improvement and value focus) can loosely align with OKR philosophy, the discussion remains generic and does not connect to OKR systems, implementation, or terminology. Intent and audience are focused on product practitioners, which has some indirect overlap, but there is little to no signal that the content actually fits the Objective Key Results category as defined.",

However, there are no direct mentions or deep exploration of agency (human or AI), systemic observability, ethical AI, or decentralised decision-making. The main intent is product value realisation, not the philosophical or structural shifts of Agentic Engineering. Audience overlap exists for practitioners, but the focus is too generic and lacks explicit Agentic Engineering concepts, practices, or terminology.",
