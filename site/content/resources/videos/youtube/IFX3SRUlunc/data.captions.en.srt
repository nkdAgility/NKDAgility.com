1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:10,500
over the last 18 months or so we've seen

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:13,920
significant more interest and more

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,980
questions around these I this idea of

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,140
lean product development especially

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,400
within the realm of product ownership

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,599
right what is it that is

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,720
pushing that and I think there is a huge

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,660
push in the industry to get better at

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,960
deciding what it is that we're building

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,120
better at making the right bets better

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,160
at

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,200
understanding what we should and

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,879
shouldn't build within a particular

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,940
context and how do we minimize the

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,280
chance of building the wrong thing

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,199
hypothesis driven engineering practices

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,920
right that that those lean product

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,800
development stories and I think that

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,799
um this is such an important topic

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,180
that Joanna and I will be running our

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,340
Workshop

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,560
on product ownership and lean product

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,020
management we're only going to talk for

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,619
about 18 minutes and then we're going to

25
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,979
have about 40 minutes of q a for you to

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,580
bring your questions your ideas your

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,780
your stories to this puzzle of what it

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,820
is

29
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,460
um you know what is lean product

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,540
development what does it

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:36,180
look like going forward into the future

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:38,220
and why is it so important to our

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,360
organizations today

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,420
so that we can so that so that we can we

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,240
can waste less money in our organization

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,299
so that we can build more value

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
um for Less uh at money higher return on

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,159
investment that's really what it's all

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,159
about
