Over the last 18 months or so, we've seen significant more interest and more questions around this idea of lean product development, especially within the realm of product ownership. Right, what is it that is pushing that? I think there is a huge push in the industry to get better at deciding what it is that we're building, better at making the right bets, better at understanding what we should and shouldn't build within a particular context, and how do we minimise the chance of building the wrong thing. Hypothesis-driven engineering practices, right? Those lean product development stories.

And I think that this is such an important topic that Joanna and I will be running our workshop on product ownership and lean product management. We're only going to talk for about 18 minutes, and then we're going to have about 40 minutes of Q&A for you to bring your questions, your ideas, your stories to this puzzle of what it is. You know, what is lean product development? What does it look like going forward into the future, and why is it so important to our organisations today? 

So that we can waste less money in our organisation, so that we can build more value for less money, higher return on investment. That's really what it's all about.
