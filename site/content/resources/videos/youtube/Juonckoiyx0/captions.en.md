One main thing that should be top of mind is what do my stakeholders care about. Right, so one of the big values of a Sprint review is engaging your stakeholders, getting information that you as a Scrum team, so that's the Product Owner, the developers, and the Scrum Master, that we as a Scrum team don't have.

How do we get that out of the stakeholders? And in order for those stakeholders to engage, they have to care. So your engagement with them during Sprint planning has a lot of marketing in it. You're asking, "What have we done for you, the stakeholder, in the last two weeks or four weeks?" Right? What have we done for you? Here’s the cool stuff we've done for you.

No, here are the API changes that we've made or the database triggers we've updated, because the stakeholders are just going to basically fall asleep and probably not going to want to come next time. So that focusing quite heavily, that one big thing is the engagement between what the team is creating and producing and the stakeholders, and how do we maximise that collaborative experience.

And perhaps even maximise the number of people that turn up. I find that in a lot of Sprint plannings, teams struggle to get the stakeholders to actually turn up, let alone engage once they're there. Right? But struggle to get them to turn up, and it's because they don't care.

So are we building the right features? Right? Are we communicating them in a way that those stakeholders need them to be communicated in order for them to understand what it is we're doing and engage with what it is we're doing? Because if you don't have that engagement, the purpose of the Sprint review is to make sure that when we walk out of the Sprint review, we have the most transparent and up-to-date product backlog.

So when we start the next Sprint, we have the most transparent and up-to-date information to get started with, and you're not going to get that if you don't engage with your stakeholders.

So getting that engagement is absolutely key.
