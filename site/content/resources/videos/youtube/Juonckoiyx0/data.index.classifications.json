    "reasoning": "The content is heavily focused on maximizing stakeholder engagement and improving communication during Sprint reviews, which is tangentially related to Team Motivation by fostering team visibility, recognition, and collaborative dynamics. While themes such as feedback, transparency, and active participation touch indirectly on motivation, the primary framing is about external stakeholder management rather than deep exploration of intrinsic or psychological motivators within Agile teams. There is some alignment in promoting engagement and team ownership, but the discussion stops short of addressing motivation as the core subject. No direct mention of 'motivation' or its proxies is present. The fit is therefore moderate: relevant practices are present but the explicit focus is stakeholder engagement, not team motivation per se.",
