1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,940
one main thing that should be top of

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,019
mind is what do my stakeholders care

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,940
about

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,220
right so so one of the big values of a

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,800
Sprint review is engaging your

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,480
stakeholders getting information that

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,100
you as a scrum team so that's the

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,840
product owner the developers and the

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,160
scrum master that we as a scrum team

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,160
don't have

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,080
how do we get that out of uh the

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,079
stakeholders and in order for those

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,079
stakeholders to engage they have to care

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,180
so you you your your

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,360
engagement with them during Sprint

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,200
planning has a lot of marketing in it

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,140
you're you're what have we done for you

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,120
the stakeholder in the last uh two weeks

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,980
or or four weeks right what have we done

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,940
for you here's the cool stuff we've done

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,879
for you

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,620
no here's the API changes that we've

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,020
made or the database triggers we've

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,760
updated because the stakeholders just

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,680
gonna basically fall asleep and probably

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,979
not gonna want to come next time

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,740
so that that focusing quite heavily that

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,960
one big thing is the engagement between

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,760
what the team is creating and producing

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,720
and the stakeholders and how do we

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,720
maximize that collaborative experience

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,060
um and and perhaps even maximize the

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,580
number of people that turn up I find

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,159
that in a lot of Sprint plannings uh at

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,380
teams struggle to get the stakeholders

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,540
to actually turn up let alone engage

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,100
once they're there right but struggle to

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,799
get them to turn up and it's because

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,640
they don't care so are we building the

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,259
right features right are we

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,060
communicating them in a way that those

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,619
stakeholders need them to be

43
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,240
communicated in order for them to

44
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,740
understand what it is we're doing and

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
engage with what it is we're doing

46
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,659
because if you don't have that

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,060
engagement the purpose the purpose of

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,040
the Sprint review is to make sure that

49
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,159
when we walk out of the Sprint review we

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,439
have the the the most transparent and

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,119
up-to-date product backlog so when we

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,439
start the next Sprint we have the most

53
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,380
transparent and up-to-date information

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,720
to get started with and you're not going

55
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,520
to get that if you don't engage with

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
your stakeholders

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,580
um so getting that engagement is

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,620
absolutely key
