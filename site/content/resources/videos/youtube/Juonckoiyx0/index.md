- **Grasping Stakeholder Priorities:** 🤝 Remember, the primary question should be, "What do our stakeholders care about?" Focus on their interests and concerns. 

- **Beyond Tech Jargon:** 📊 Technical details are important, but how they're communicated to stakeholders makes all the difference. 

- **The Art of Engagement:** 💬 Think of each update as a chance to market the team's achievements in a way that highlights value to stakeholders. 

## Crafting a Stakeholder-Centric Sprint Review 🎯 

Effective Sprint reviews are tailored to the audience - your stakeholders. This section focuses on aligning the review process with stakeholder interests and needs. 

- **Tailoring Communication:** 🗣️ Adopt a communication style that resonates with stakeholders, focusing on the impact rather than just technical details.
