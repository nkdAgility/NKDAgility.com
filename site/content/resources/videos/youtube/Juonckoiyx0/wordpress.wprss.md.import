The #sprintreview is a critical feedback loop in #agile #productdevelopment. An opportunity for the #scrumteam to meet with customers and product stakeholders to evaluate what has been built, what hasn't been built, and where the team need to focus next.

ideally, it's about creating a powerful connection between your organization and it's customers, and using the #sprintreview to inform what your team need to focus on next.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the things that should be top of mind for a #scrummaster when preparing for the Sprint Review.
