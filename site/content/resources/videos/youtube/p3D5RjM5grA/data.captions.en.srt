episode six and I'm here with a

6
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:52,050
gentleman called russell miller

who i have known or an incredibly much

8
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,399
longer than you would think a long time

9
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,019
russell wouldn't you introduce yourself

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,830
hi I'm Russell Miller I live in Atlanta

11
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:06,509
Georgia USA I'm a product development

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,220
specialist and scrum dad or a

13
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:13,080
professional trainer cool and we spent a

14
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:18,179
little bit of time working together this

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:21,690
week we facilitated a virtual live

16
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:27,350
virtual classroom on Monday Tuesday of

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:29,479
the professional agile leadership labor

18
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:34,440
is anything you want to say about the

19
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:36,750
course itself of course is geared toward

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,060
those who want to see agility grow and

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,350
thrive in their organizations and want

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,560
to know how leaders can positively or

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:51,270
sometimes negatively influence that yeah

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:55,610
for me the courses are trying to move

25
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:59,399
people from the ideas of management of

26
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:01,290
people to leading people so you're no

27
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,320
longer really managing people anymore

28
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:09,479
you're creating environments within

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:13,049
which people can thrive yes and we're

30
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,269
also disciplines that those things

31
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,400
aren't needed once you move to more

32
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:19,709
agile ways of working because they are

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,420
very much needed they are very much

34
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,109
needed organizations have definitely

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:29,070
functioning without somebody if we're

36
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:31,410
focused on delivering value in a product

37
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,950
it's difficult to spend the time that

38
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:37,290
you need on making changes to the way we

39
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,769
deliver that product the way we interact

40
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:46,590
with people and you need somebody with

41
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:48,690
that dedicated focus yes oh so we had we

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,300
had a good time we had sick

43
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:57,330
students so we broke them into two teams

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:03:01,830
and the course is very exercise driven

45
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,660
so we kind of went back and forth what

46
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:09,240
do you think kind of worked well in the

47
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:14,580
class fear I think that the students had

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,860
the ability to give communicate their

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,170
own experiences especially in their

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,590
group but also in the larger in the

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,450
larger group and it's good to be able to

52
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,680
express some of your thoughts because

53
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,110
that's actually a bit of a learning

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,490
exercise you know you when you express

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,260
your thoughts you have to formulate them

56
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:37,050
and helps you really more with a greater

57
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,030
focus examine your own experiences and

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,860
then you can get feedback on those

59
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,410
experiences so that was that was good

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,530
for the students when we do have a

61
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,940
smaller class size of SIG's you can get

62
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,980
a lot of your specific questions

63
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,410
answered so that was a big positive for

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,160
this I mean we'd love to have you know

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,570
20 people or tween and you know give our

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,120
agile goodness to as many people as

67
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,530
possible but for this for the students

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,560
who attended with a smaller class size

69
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,290
that was really beneficial for them I

70
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,690
thought it was super great - since we're

71
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,340
relatively new in the world of live

72
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,080
virtual training scrum board

73
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,900
it's good for the students to be able to

74
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:25,230
join quickly from the comfort of their

75
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:27,240
own home or office those are a highlight

76
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,070
of some of the pieces yes there's a

77
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,960
little bit of a delay that's why I was

78
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:39,030
waiting there I was waiting for for your

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:42,510
voice to finish so we um we spent quite

80
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:46,560
a lot of time working together in the

81
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:49,200
class as well as having since we were

82
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,780
working in two teams we had two trainers

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,850
so a trainer could go with each team and

84
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,370
make sure that they didn't fell feel

85
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,570
left out and alone and I think that is

86
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,340
the the difficulty with live virtual

87
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,570
classrooms the

88
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:10,470
students don't feel the love from the

89
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:15,560
trainer and have difficulty getting

90
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:20,160
getting attention on the upside to that

91
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,820
because of the electronic means students

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,720
can can summon the trainer to their to

93
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,610
their breakout area regardless of which

94
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,710
tool you're using all the tools have the

95
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,170
ability must al most of the tools that

96
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,610
we're using him I'm sorry all other

97
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,850
tools that we're using have the ability

98
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,830
to to summon the instructor or one of

99
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,840
the instructors to the small group and

100
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,810
so that's a bit of a positive because in

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,540
a larger classroom setting the students

102
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,160
may be inhibited to you know to ask for

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,230
help they may look up and see the

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,300
instructor talking to somebody else but

105
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,890
through the electronic means since

106
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,510
there's only one way to summon the

107
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,970
instructor I think people are less

108
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,060
inhibited when they want some some

109
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,490
attention to ask for it so it's a bit of

110
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,410
a it works both ways and both in the

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,720
negative end I see it more as a positive

112
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,850
we just tell people if you need help

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,030
here's the way you can help and don't be

114
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,030
bashful

115
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,919
so it's quite a lot of delay in the

116
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:30,439
audio that was my wait there between for

117
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,939
some reason it's the video is in sync

118
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,729
but the audio wasn't which seems a

119
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:40,949
little bit weird to me usually it's the

120
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:44,999
other way around but that's the way the

121
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,859
cookie crumbles sometimes so I'll speak

122
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:49,439
in sure I really I really enjoyed that

123
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:54,169
aspect of making sure that the the

124
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,169
students had somebody to talk to and

125
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:05,099
it's difficult with the the facilitating

126
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:06,839
the exercises and I think that one of

127
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:09,899
the things that that were was very

128
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:12,959
difficult for me and was getting

129
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:18,349
attention back from the breakout rooms

130
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:22,019
from the exercises you find that as well

131
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:24,809
that was the challenge we have a blinker

132
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:27,839
that says come back but hurting the cats

133
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:31,969
isn't always as easy as is in a live

134
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,969
classroom in a live in-person classroom

135
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:43,439
yes exactly

136
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,179
I think it's a bit a neat is that

137
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,439
five-second Billy something like that

138
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:54,299
it's a super fun so um I am just working

139
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,589
around it as we are in need to do and so

140
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:57,509
I think definitely having the two

141
00:07:55,589 --> 00:08:00,889
facilitators for the exercises is going

142
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:07,009
to be much better I'm actually teaching

143
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:09,389
private PSF for 20 people with four

144
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:11,759
teams on Monday

145
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,529
which is going to be interesting I've

146
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,779
managed to organize a couple of extra

147
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,849
trainers but we'll see how that goes

148
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,119
with two people in the room but

149
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:24,469
something that I think did work well um

150
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:27,389
was we were using Microsoft teams as our

151
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:30,539
technical environment for for running

152
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:34,620
the the event and we were able to very

153
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:39,030
easily create team-based breakout

154
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,860
and have a call continuously running in

155
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:48,150
that breakout room and then easily

156
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:48,870
switch between those two things I was

157
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,660
shocked

158
00:08:48,870 --> 00:09:03,810
hell I expected it to be a hurdle and it

159
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:06,180
wasn't yep III thought teams worked very

160
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,110
well with that better than I was

161
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,800
expecting

162
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,870
being able to switch between things um I

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,460
know that I had a lot of problems with

164
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,380
neural and I think you you didn't you

165
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:31,350
had everything was super snappy and fast

166
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:33,410
yeah zero zero zero problems so and what

167
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,650
what I did find

168
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:41,310
after some significant googling after

169
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:45,710
the event was that this I have a surface

170
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:48,930
book one and surface book one has a

171
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,910
performance problem if you have a attach

172
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:56,010
a second monitor there is also 60 Hertz

173
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,070
so I've actually moved my 60 Hertz

174
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,780
monitor off to another machine and I'm

175
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:06,960
using much cheaper not very good monitor

176
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,360
but that I can set to 50 Hertz and I'm

177
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,760
not having the same performance problems

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,260
on my machine that I was having with

179
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,880
with that I'm gonna try and upgrade my

180
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,740
machine at some point but it's difficult

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,180
to do in lockdown because there's

182
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:34,290
nothing left the whole world is buying

183
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:40,470
electronics yes and I found that am i

184
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:43,620
gay webcams impossible to get I managed

185
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:47,010
to get my microphone upgrade I got a a

186
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,760
te X microphone which was fine and I got

187
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,720
a stream down

188
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:58,710
or manipulating the the inter inter

189
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,880
swimmy webs but ya know webcams and it

190
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,460
can be difficult to get some of the

191
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,320
other other pcs and I think even my my

192
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,640
microphones I can't get I wouldn't be

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:14,000
all to get another one if I wanted in my

194
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,000
life pays to be prepared

195
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:26,420
at least we have sound and a consistent

196
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:29,029
internet connection this time last time

197
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,910
we did this we tried to do it on Tuesday

198
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:35,269
or was it Wednesday it was Tuesday and

199
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,069
it was a complete cluster with internet

200
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:38,420
not being very good I think we left it a

201
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:43,819
little bit late and we had Netflix

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:49,550
traffic in Europe but it was still the

203
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:52,369
problem I need to work on why my Skype

204
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:56,839
over here which the system is not

205
00:11:52,369 --> 00:12:01,429
particularly taxed 60% usage which is

206
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:05,480
not too bad but we'll need to only to

207
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:08,860
see overtime if I can if I can fix that

208
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,720
and repair it for these types of chats

209
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,129
are there any other things and feel free

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,379
to talk for a little bit longer because

211
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:17,389
we have a seven or eight second delete

212
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,990
anyway so may as well talk about that

213
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:24,199
longer and then I can just wait tree

214
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:26,420
what what saw any other things that you

215
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:30,350
felt you wanted to add to the experience

216
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,540
during this well a couple of things that

217
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,610
I think people should should should bear

218
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,129
in mind if they're thinking about either

219
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,429
delivering live virtual training because

220
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:42,490
we have a lot of the world that we live

221
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:44,689
in and the product development space

222
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,059
especially software probably development

223
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:49,429
space requires some specialized skills

224
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,499
and specialized training and so there

225
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:55,459
are a lot of trainers in the world that

226
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:58,309
are trying to learn how to deliver their

227
00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:00,889
great training content virtually and

228
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:04,220
then there are students who are trying

229
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:06,769
to up their skills especially those who

230
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,279
have been economically impacted by by

231
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:12,410
the worldwide economic impact those

232
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,149
people are you know some of those find

233
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,480
themselves suddenly furloughed or laid

234
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:20,179
off or downsized and people are trying

235
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,889
to up their skills and they're looking

236
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,999
at their backlog of training and so a

237
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,740
couple things I think are worthy of

238
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:28,429
consideration that after having

239
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,550
delivered several of these are more more

240
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,800
at the forefront of my mind than ever

241
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,769
um students that travel to my in-person

242
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,540
classes if they travel from outside the

243
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:41,589
city in which I'm delivering those

244
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,740
people incur often airfare costs lodging

245
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:47,019
costs or their employers and meal cost

246
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,690
and those are zero for live virtual

247
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:52,329
training I think that's a big big deal

248
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,540
I've had people travel as I view I mean

249
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,610
on multiple occasions I mean a lot of

250
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,709
vacations people travel internationally

251
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,730
even to attend courses that I'm

252
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:05,019
delivering and not only do you not

253
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,420
expend the resources the financial

254
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:10,000
resources to make the travel trip but

255
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:13,060
you don't have the long time that you

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,350
have to it's not really a waste because

257
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,870
you're getting training at the end of it

258
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,640
but but it's you would like to be able

259
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,829
to have a transporter and just go from

260
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,329
wherever you are to the training locale

261
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:27,490
and not spend 4 6 8 10 12 hours travel

262
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,519
maybe even you know one-way sometimes so

263
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,279
that's a huge advantage and you don't

264
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,560
spend that travel time away from your

265
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:39,070
loved ones or family or exercise routine

266
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,100
or favorite pastime so these are not

267
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,579
insignificant advantages and some of the

268
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,290
training that we're doing live now and

269
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:50,820
we you know we don't know what the

270
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,589
future holds but it may not be the same

271
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:55,450
say maybe some ways may be better but

272
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:59,430
some of the training that's now offered

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:02,290
virtually once we go back to the the old

274
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,579
old way of working you might not be able

275
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,100
to get it virtually so you might

276
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,959
consider it's much you know if you need

277
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,149
some training and have the resources and

278
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:11,649
the time then you might want to get I'm

279
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,560
serious you might want to get some of it

280
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,870
now because you don't have to incur the

281
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,449
expense and effort to travel to a

282
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:22,199
location so it's my sincere belief

283
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:22,199
Martin

284
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:37,770
I totally agree and I have I it's

285
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,220
sometimes a little bit different

286
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,899
training in the US than it is training

287
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,870
in some other parts of the world just

288
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:51,810
because I think I trained in 32

289
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,000
different countries over the last 10

290
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:57,930
years

291
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,770
I'm usually about 12 countries a year on

292
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,540
average and that means 12 different

293
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:07,430
languages 12 different cultures although

294
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,200
I know the culture for example between

295
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,830
Atlanta where you are and Seattle is

296
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,610
very different as well but at least

297
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,700
there's less of a language barrier

298
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:23,430
everybody supposed to speak English and

299
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,560
usually it's bad English but ok that's

300
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:31,230
generally an American thing

301
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:33,510
but aha yeah um but I found that that

302
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,040
when you're dealing with radically

303
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,500
different cultures like I could be

304
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,730
teaching one week in Saudi Arabia

305
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,070
another week in the Netherlands another

306
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:45,660
week in Norway and people's attitude and

307
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:48,890
outlook and the thing the way they react

308
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:53,040
to things can be very different as well

309
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:56,010
even things are an interesting one and

310
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,610
that I've mentioned information in my

311
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:02,870
class II sometimes that when I'm in

312
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,939
Norway we have an expression in English

313
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,819
where you might say you don't want to

314
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:10,829
look like you've got egg on your face

315
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:15,660
and I think that translates to American

316
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:18,630
as well that's a common phrase but that

317
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,079
doesn't necessarily translate to Norway

318
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,550
to Denmark to Sweden to Saudi Arabia

319
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,380
while Saudi Arabians they're British

320
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:33,990
anyway that was a British colony it

321
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:36,510
seems to have but that's saying but for

322
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,830
example in Norway it's it's you don't

323
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,450
want to look like you've caught your

324
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:46,230
beard in the mailbox which so who knew

325
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:50,580
and another one is everybody's on the

326
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,080
same page which is a common English

327
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,910
expression in the Netherlands it's

328
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,070
everybody's noses are pointed in the

329
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,590
same direction so you kind of have to

330
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,790
learn a lot of debt do you have to learn

331
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,169
a lot of different is it idioms I think

332
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,730
that might be the right word yes

333
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,620
they're different videos that people

334
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,620
talk about things in different countries

335
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:14,910
and what it means because words can make

336
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:19,650
a big difference to how thank you how

337
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:22,020
you interpret the the material that

338
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:25,260
we're presenting and even though a lot

339
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:29,309
of the work that happens inside of the

340
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,500
class is interactions between the

341
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,120
students rather than just interactions

342
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,350
between the like a one-way communication

343
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:41,600
between the trainer and the students I

344
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:45,000
think there's still a lot of things that

345
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,010
we need to take care of in in that

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,020
setting I guess my question for you

347
00:18:47,010 --> 00:19:03,410
would be how you we had a in our class

348
00:18:52,020 --> 00:19:07,200
we had two Germans one two from Slovakia

349
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:12,990
it's the back here I think no we're

350
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:16,260
split and well it's not Slovakia I've

351
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:20,460
got my countries mixed up as I am apt to

352
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,580
do and my brain has died but we had two

353
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,980
from Eastern Europe - from Germany one

354
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:30,540
from Leeds in the UK which is kind of

355
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:33,179
middle England and one from London but

356
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,429
who wasn't from anywhere near London

357
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:41,370
just just worked there how did you find

358
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:43,909
that different group of people I found

359
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:46,679
that that particular mix of students

360
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,510
worked well and you you you touched on

361
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,380
or circled around something I think is a

362
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:55,470
bit of an advantage to the training

363
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,560
whether it be live or sorry live and in

364
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,940
person or live and virtual is that you

365
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,710
get to expand a little bit of your

366
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,840
cultural horizons and I don't mean just

367
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,909
for the entertainment value I mean it

368
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,130
causes you to reconsider some of your

369
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:15,780
outlook and your the way you approach

370
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,220
situations if you're if you're

371
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,070
constantly and people from your own

372
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,110
culture then you don't really have the

373
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:28,409
same reason to to examine your own

374
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:30,450
stance and your own perspective but when

375
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,250
you when I find fun I find that I'm

376
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,919
around people from other cultures I'm

377
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,740
more conscious of what I'm thinking I'm

378
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:40,230
more conscious of my idioms and I'm more

379
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:44,010
conscious to the way that I look at the

380
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,630
person you know artists are those who

381
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,909
have art training realize that you have

382
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,409
a you might have a still life but there

383
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,740
are multiple perspectives from which you

384
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:54,960
can draw or sketch or paint that's still

385
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,350
life and so I find that when students

386
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,060
are or people professionals are immersed

387
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,679
in their own culture they don't have the

388
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,169
same reason to take a different

389
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,120
perspective and that's one of the things

390
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,650
that when I teach people about the scrum

391
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,580
master role if I could segue just a

392
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,020
moment is that one of the things that I

393
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,940
try to get students to understand about

394
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,409
the scrum master role is that it's not

395
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,480
only about the specific accountabilities

396
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,850
of the scrum master role but we need

397
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,340
someone that has a different perspective

398
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,860
like you suggested that the people doing

399
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,320
the work need the perspective of someone

400
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,050
in a different position in the

401
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,240
organization looking down not down but

402
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,370
up at the work from a different point of

403
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,060
view and that's one of the powers of the

404
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:45,300
scrum master role is because that person

405
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:47,340
often has different daily activities

406
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,560
than some of the people that are on the

407
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:52,280
development team creating the increment

408
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:54,659
that that difference of perspective

409
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,690
provides a lot of valuable information

410
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:01,169
that often scrum teams don't appreciate

411
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,250
they don't understand why oh well you

412
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,190
need it the scrum master

413
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,830
to do this or this or this well yeah he

414
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,200
or she does but here she also needs to

415
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,850
have a perspective that's that's

416
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,010
different focusing on different things

417
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:16,560
in their minds and so I think that's a

418
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,720
powerful thing that students who attend

419
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,240
to class with multiple cultures

420
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:34,790
represent get a little bit of a benefit

421
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:39,330
from learn I totally agree and that I

422
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:44,730
taught classes in Africa in Middle

423
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:48,630
Eastern Eastern Europe UK and us as well

424
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,310
and I even talked I manic I awesome

425
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,870
class I might as a teach a class in can

426
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:57,380
couldn't you kinda can't get better than

427
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:02,160
that that was good

428
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,780
and I think that we're I think it's

429
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,990
going to be difficult to put the the

430
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,850
training Jeannie online training genie

431
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:14,940
back in the bottle and the feedback from

432
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:17,780
many of the the students is that while

433
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:22,530
they might prefer an in-person

434
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:26,940
experience from students that have gone

435
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:31,770
through both an in-person class and an

436
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:34,250
online class because of the quality that

437
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,420
is required by scrum the darg and the

438
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:42,170
pursuit of that quality by the trainers

439
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:46,110
the the the students are not seeing a

440
00:23:42,170 --> 00:24:00,630
discernible quality decrease from the

441
00:23:46,110 --> 00:24:05,250
interactions but again absolutely we

442
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:06,960
were worried that the the the quality of

443
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,000
training that you could deliver remotely

444
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,320
would be substantially less but I think

445
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,020
the the ideas behind that are behind

446
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,600
that notion that it would be sustained

447
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:24,750
alas I come from maybe five five or more

448
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,510
years ago where some of the technologies

449
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:31,050
that are available to us like mural

450
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:34,830
which we were using in the class was was

451
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:37,830
not as mature not as able to provide

452
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,140
that experience for students the video

453
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,420
conferencing technology necessarily

454
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:45,360
wasn't I mean it was there but it

455
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:49,440
potentially wasn't as good as it is that

456
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,330
no I mean it's this in most cases apart

457
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,790
from obviously our problem with Skype

458
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:59,880
here and delije it's it's generally

459
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:03,120
generally flawless you made the comment

460
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,250
that during the class you felt like some

461
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,040
of the students we're in the same room

462
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:15,270
as you because of the the quality of the

463
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:18,420
video that they were able to push you

464
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:23,070
bring up a good point Martin students

465
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:26,340
are not only learning about scrum and

466
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:28,050
agile leadership and in our professional

467
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:33,660
scrum master courses and product

468
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:37,320
ownership and using scrum and user

469
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,930
experience design approaches but they're

470
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,610
also learning about some very modern

471
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:47,160
very very modern technologies for remote

472
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,450
work and for people who you know work

473
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,060
two days a week or three days a week

474
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:53,940
from home these technologies that we're

475
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,590
using so it's a bit of a I'm going to go

476
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,680
off and get some leadership training but

477
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,690
I'm also going to go off and and for a

478
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,750
bonus I'm going to get some experience

479
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:08,100
and training using electronic recording

480
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:11,010
tools and learning how to break a larger

481
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,020
team out into multiple groups so so

482
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,460
you're getting I always want to look at

483
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,520
the value that we're delivering to

484
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,170
students and that's a value that again

485
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,760
before I began delivering this training

486
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,260
I wasn't really perceiving that as a

487
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,340
value I was more focused on trying to

488
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,460
maintain the quality of the experience

489
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,680
and and now I'm realizing that there's

490
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,900
some some bonuses that students are

491
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:44,330
getting

492
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:46,970
that I had originally thought about I'm

493
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,130
still trying to fix that delete but I

494
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,820
will see you have it I can't get it and

495
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:54,350
I think to to go but I yes I agree and I

496
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:00,590
think I also agree with what you said

497
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:05,810
before about the the this is a good time

498
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:10,340
for people to think about live virtual

499
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:12,260
training I know that the the number of

500
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:16,400
people now unemployed in the US is

501
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:19,940
incredibly high part of that is the

502
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,430
system within which your economy

503
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:27,050
operates and in the UK there's more

504
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:29,480
people who are our load then then made

505
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:33,650
unemployed and part of the furlough

506
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,570
rules in the UK are that you can receive

507
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,090
training while you're on furlough and

508
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:40,180
your company can pay for it and that's

509
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,860
the one thing that you're allowed to do

510
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,290
so it's even a government recommendation

511
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,260
that you do or put people on training

512
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,970
that are furloughed to just keep keep

513
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,920
people doing stuff keep people learning

514
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,950
and figuring out what's what's what's

515
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,750
next and I think things like like the

516
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,240
agile leadership is good for that that

517
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:03,950
cater of middle management that maybe

518
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:08,300
feel like they have difficulty in

519
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:11,270
justifying their existence maybe more so

520
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:14,570
at this time when the teams are all off

521
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:19,010
doing something separately and you just

522
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:24,620
end up in meetings all day and I think

523
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:30,200
that that I don't know I just think that

524
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:34,180
there's this space for for people to

525
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:37,810
learn a lot a lot more during this time

526
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,810
not that they have to

527
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:44,140
yeah you bring up a good point Martin

528
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:47,590
one of the powers of the agile

529
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,970
leadership training the the major upside

530
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,240
to that agile leadership training is you

531
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,220
got two or three things going on in

532
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,470
organizations that are moving to more

533
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,419
agile ways of solution or product or

534
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,549
service development and one of the

535
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,340
things that the teams are beginning to

536
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:06,210
get a taste of what we call self

537
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,950
organization in other words getting to

538
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,929
use more of their influence because

539
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,409
they're closer to the work and so when

540
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:18,309
teams began to to get a taste of that

541
00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:19,840
then they have some newfound needs some

542
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:22,539
some needs that they didn't have before

543
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,120
and so teaching leaders how what those

544
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:27,429
needs are and and a little bit about how

545
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,840
to meet those needs is powerful but in

546
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:34,870
addition the teams themselves sometimes

547
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,690
fail to appreciate if I can be blunt the

548
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,309
contribution that that managers at

549
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,960
various levels sometimes crowd

550
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,220
appreciate that the contribution that

551
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,700
managers at different levels in the

552
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,110
organization have have to contribution

553
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,909
they have to offer or contribution they

554
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,679
have to make and so we want to teach

555
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:55,150
both of those things we want to say look

556
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:57,190
you have to a leader to a person in a

557
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,980
management level in the organization you

558
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:01,780
have some new responsibilities that

559
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,539
there's some care and feeding that these

560
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,270
teams and individuals need that that's

561
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:10,120
different but also there's an

562
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,559
opportunity there to to also try to

563
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,659
communicate back to the larger

564
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,960
organization not only their needs but

565
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:18,490
also the the upside of okay great they

566
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,070
have these needs and we want to meet

567
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,140
those needs but what is the goodness and

568
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,200
the upside what's coming out of these

569
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,480
teams like the identification of

570
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,690
organizational impediments for example

571
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,890
that that and the the view now that

572
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:37,570
scrum masters have across the

573
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:40,450
organization of I say some synergies and

574
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:43,179
also some some impediments and how do we

575
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,950
get that goodness out you know that

576
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:47,020
information that rich flow of

577
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,610
information that we the teams are

578
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,050
getting now that maybe they didn't have

579
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,150
before how are we how do we

580
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,250
read that across the organization so we

581
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,010
talk about communities of practice for

582
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,630
engineering practitioners and and

583
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:01,990
designers and scrum masters and product

584
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:04,900
owners but we really we really the same

585
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,670
concept of sharing of information needs

586
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,410
to happen at the in the middle

587
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:19,600
management layers and so that's an

588
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:30,370
opportunity as well agreed and I think

589
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:35,290
that and it's also the the nope

590
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:37,510
I was practicing active listening and

591
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:45,340
the thing that I thought I was going to

592
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:49,710
say is now it's now gone there are there

593
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:53,320
are a lot of teams in organizations now

594
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:56,520
that are being forced to work remotely

595
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,910
when they would have preferred to work

596
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:03,280
co-located and I think not that word

597
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:07,510
co-located is very important here

598
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,270
because it's really it's really just a

599
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:14,560
metaphor for people working closely

600
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:16,360
together it's it's trying to say that if

601
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:20,380
you're in the same building but on

602
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,750
different floors then that's not good

603
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:27,690
for you being able to work together

604
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:31,060
effectively and I think online on

605
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:35,140
technology modern technology can kind of

606
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:38,740
allow us to have a level of colocation

607
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,530
as long as everybody in the team that's

608
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:47,050
communicating digitally is in the same

609
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:49,660
time zone that we're may be able to to

610
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,850
to practice some of those colocation

611
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,320
skills from this perspective because

612
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,820
there are a lot of people who work from

613
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,280
home as well there are a lot of people

614
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:01,390
who don't want to live in the big city

615
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:04,419
don't want to commute into work I don't

616
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:08,289
know what it's like in cities in the US

617
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:12,429
but London commutes can be three hours

618
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:16,450
plus to get from your home to wherever

619
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:20,260
your offices and people do that because

620
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:27,340
they have to not because they should be

621
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:29,620
doing that yes and people don't have to

622
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,600
be in the same exact time zone but I

623
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,000
think it's when you haven't you know six

624
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,130
hour time shift or greater or maybe five

625
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,529
that you begin running into the

626
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,740
challenge just especially if you have an

627
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:45,190
even larger time shift so I'm liking the

628
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:49,779
idea of having a select number of people

629
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:52,929
in a video team meeting when working

630
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:55,179
remotely maybe they're on mute maybe

631
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:57,190
they're sometimes on mute but having a

632
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,510
small group or even with some of the

633
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,570
technologies you can have an even a

634
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:05,590
larger group and what research has found

635
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,840
is that a line of sight is a is a lack

636
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:12,399
of line of sight is a barrier for

637
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,579
communication so in some ways depending

638
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,109
on how you set your groups up you can

639
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:29,260
actually have improved line-of-sight

640
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:33,190
over in person work yeah I think I think

641
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:37,179
Microsoft did a study that with the

642
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:41,760
judicious use of modern technology that

643
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:45,909
you can get and higher levels of

644
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,109
communication and colocation bonuses for

645
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:52,530
for teams that are working together and

646
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:54,760
they were using ridiculous levels of

647
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,770
Technology because they can and they

648
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,500
have lots of money to figure it out and

649
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:03,599
and and do that but for most of us

650
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:06,160
there's the the tools like Skype and

651
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,510
zoom when they get the security problems

652
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,610
fixed and teams and I don't know WebEx

653
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,760
and whatever else you want

654
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:19,810
to use there's a plethora of choices out

655
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:23,440
there that can help us get closer

656
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:28,020
together while we're far away one that

657
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:32,500
I'd noticed the families are using

658
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:36,610
something called house party which

659
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,350
allows you to see when people people

660
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:42,730
mark themselves at home

661
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:45,610
ie I'm open for for a chat and you can

662
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,760
you can just have a room with many

663
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:52,300
people having a chat talking about stuff

664
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,660
and it handles the multiple people

665
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:59,440
talking at once problem very well

666
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,090
whereas other tools are not so concerned

667
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,570
with that because you want one person

668
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:06,670
talking at once they handle that a room

669
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:11,190
as a party and you can kind of drop in

670
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:14,890
and out of different channels and groups

671
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:18,130
very very quickly I think it's only on

672
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,130
the the the thorn but it seemed to work

673
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,950
at work pretty well and I think there's

674
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,430
going to be a lot more apps sitting that

675
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,520
space

676
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,710
I actually I have I have M because I

677
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,640
used to live in the u.s. I lived in

678
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:36,340
Seattle for three years I started using

679
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,990
Amazon for for books and audible books

680
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:43,480
and stuff and super super early on at

681
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:47,260
that time because I couldn't take all of

682
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:50,290
my physical media across the ocean with

683
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:54,160
me so I've ended up with all of my

684
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:56,470
accounts or US based which poses some

685
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,590
problems for example I have to buy my

686
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:02,020
xbox in the living room runs off our

687
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:07,090
proxy effectively a proxy so that it

688
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:09,940
thinks it's in the US so I are you

689
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,010
legitimately in order to buy us stuff

690
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,800
you have to have a US credit card which

691
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:18,790
I have you have to have a u.s. address

692
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,710
which I have so it's it's perfectly

693
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:23,830
legitimate I just can't get access to

694
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,990
that content because I travel so much

695
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:31,960
and actually if you think about it

696
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:35,410
apart from now I was spending 300 days a

697
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,610
year travelling regardless of where I

698
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,790
physically lived my my my time was spent

699
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:47,290
in in hotel rooms so I think that the

700
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:50,470
and the thing that I noticed was I have

701
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:53,430
I have some channels on Amazon that have

702
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:56,260
advertising and it's all American

703
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,660
advertising which is something laughable

704
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:00,820
you you can't have the the funniest

705
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,340
thing my wife and I talk about it all

706
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:06,070
the time when the adverts come on is

707
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,110
American drug adverts and and when they

708
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,870
talk about all of the crap at the end

709
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:13,720
that is going to basically kill you or

710
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:15,820
deform you in some way we're sitting

711
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,280
there thinking there's no way we would

712
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:22,200
ever take any drug advertise in the news

713
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:26,530
but and there are now a lot of adverts

714
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:32,500
about social distancing about companies

715
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:33,850
providing services and new either new

716
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,350
companies or existing companies

717
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:40,590
providing services around that and

718
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:43,570
that's the ability to take advantage of

719
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:47,740
opportunities when they arise is kind of

720
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:56,950
the whole purpose of this thing we're

721
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:59,980
trying to do in the first place yeah I

722
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:05,500
am another thing that if I could just

723
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:09,220
segue a bit to suggest is that there are

724
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,960
some downsides not downsides some some

725
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,080
things students should know if they're

726
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,710
considering online training and the

727
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,720
camera in your laptop will will work if

728
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,970
you have a better camera by all means

729
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,230
use it it's not required to have a

730
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,440
better camera than the one in your

731
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:28,780
laptop if you have a second monitor and

732
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,690
and do intend to take some live virtual

733
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,960
training then by all means have the

734
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:37,960
second monitor hooked up because it does

735
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,460
add a lot to the experience if you don't

736
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,340
have a second monitor it

737
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:45,010
not a insurmountable barrier by any

738
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:49,960
means there there is technology that

739
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:53,350
will allow you to use your tablet or you

740
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,990
know iPad or Android tablet as a second

741
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,850
display so if you don't aren't already

742
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:02,230
using that and don't have a second

743
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:05,790
display otherwise then then look into

744
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:10,240
that but prior to prior to taking some

745
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:13,360
virtual training your your earbuds with

746
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,760
the mic will likely work adequately for

747
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,630
a live virtual training if you have a

748
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,510
headset then that's likely better

749
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:24,310
because headsets and oftentimes have not

750
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,090
always but oftentimes have a little bit

751
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,460
of features that help with canceling out

752
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:32,920
external noise so these are some things

753
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,380
for those who are considering laboratory

754
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,840
training that you might want to - to

755
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,760
think about and especially think about a

756
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,470
little bit before your training because

757
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,420
if there's some things you decide you

758
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:45,520
want to purchase then you can't get them

759
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:47,140
quite as easily now so you might want to

760
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,610
make the purchase now even if you're

761
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,080
considering some of these things are

762
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,530
quite reasonably priced these headsets

763
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,950
are not expensive if you buy a small

764
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:00,190
display small monitor you can get those

765
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,750
not an exorbitant cost and those are

766
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,330
readily available the larger ones are a

767
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,560
little bit more in demand but some of

768
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,800
these things you might consider putting

769
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:12,940
on your if you have the resources your

770
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:23,620
you're ordering backlog but it's just

771
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:26,280
proof or thumb and hopefully for most

772
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,240
folks there their company will be

773
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,210
helping them out with some of these

774
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,510
purchases certainly I had trouble

775
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:36,700
getting a second webcam and just because

776
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:39,070
there are none available anymore because

777
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:42,760
everybody's and bought that and the

778
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:45,610
ships were coming from China anyway with

779
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,200
the stock and there was a shutdown for

780
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:50,680
about three months in China so there's

781
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,170
going to be unduly a procurement delay

782
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,230
there

783
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,589
that is more unusual and but for example

784
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:02,040
I have our video camera I have a

785
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:05,280
doorknob EP is a Canon yes I have our

786
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,490
Canon video camera that I bought many

787
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,410
years ago and that has an HDMI out and

788
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:13,950
then I bought a dongle which was

789
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,869
available to be able to plug it into my

790
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,059
computer to use that as a second camera

791
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:21,500
and that's the one that I'm on just now

792
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:25,140
and is significantly better quality than

793
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:28,290
the one that's built into my laptop and

794
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,210
that type of thing is definitely well

795
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:33,809
worth it and I would agree on a second

796
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:37,799
monitor so that you can have the video

797
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:41,730
the pictures of people up all the time

798
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:43,859
and then do work on the other or the

799
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:58,020
other screen I think that would be be

800
00:42:43,859 --> 00:43:00,000
important cool so um it's giving you

801
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,530
enough time to interject there I don't

802
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,099
know how bad that I think the delay is

803
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:08,069
pretty short for me to you because you

804
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,980
react to things that I save very close

805
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:13,109
to what I'm when I'm saying it it's just

806
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,730
the reverse that is not true and I will

807
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:20,040
need to figure out how to fix that for

808
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:28,380
future sessions was there anything else

809
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:31,710
um that we wanted to add to to our list

810
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,799
of things today a bit of encouragement

811
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:37,680
to them those who are reviewing and in

812
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:40,230
two ways and two aspects I should say

813
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,960
the the training at participating the

814
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:47,130
training is usually a very stimulating

815
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,460
and invigorating activity so for those

816
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:53,130
who find themselves suddenly remote

817
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,780
that's an upside but the encouragement I

818
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,309
want to give to those who are watching

819
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:01,920
who are suddenly remote is there a take

820
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,349
advantage of meetup groups in your local

821
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,599
area and often those meetup groups are

822
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:09,750
now having virtual

823
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,240
meetups so use this as an opportunity to

824
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:15,869
network with your peers or groups of

825
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,300
people that you that you haven't taken

826
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:21,720
advantage of in the past person I say

827
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,070
that because personally in the Atlanta

828
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,920
area there are a lot of meetups that

829
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:29,700
I've had interest in but not the time to

830
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,800
travel to them and so now that I'm now

831
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,290
that we're everyone in Atlanta is sudden

832
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,700
well not everyone uh everyone except

833
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,780
essential services or suddenly remote

834
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,150
then I'm getting to spend some time

835
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,650
learning about communities that I

836
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,089
couldn't learn about in the past meeting

837
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,130
people I couldn't meet in the past

838
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:49,230
because I didn't have the time to

839
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,570
physically go but now that those people

840
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:56,099
are meeting virtually I've made several

841
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:57,599
very enriching professional connections

842
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:02,339
just in the last few weeks

843
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:13,640
via meetups that have a live virtual

844
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:16,050
component yeah most of the meetups in

845
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Scotland that I actually found

846
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,490
definitely getting to as well because

847
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:23,490
I'm in Glasgow and many of the meetups

848
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:25,410
are in Edinburgh and it's it's not the

849
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,869
easiest thing in the world to get

850
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:31,770
between the two and especially at the

851
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:34,650
moment but they've gone all online I

852
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:38,130
spoke at one of the meetups and I did it

853
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:41,369
as a live stream for them which they

854
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,160
have now continued to do live streaming

855
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:46,650
the event which I think is is is good as

856
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,800
well and they've found that they're

857
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,780
actually getting more people coming

858
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,849
because it's a live streamed event and

859
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,680
they're getting more people from much

860
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,450
further away they're getting people from

861
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,839
other countries dialing in because they

862
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:02,670
just think the topics interesting you

863
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,260
know my local meetup has topic a and

864
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,030
this one no that is that that's much

865
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,550
more interesting than than the one that

866
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,380
I was thinking of going to and you're

867
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:15,480
getting that that higher levels of

868
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,829
diversity which i think is super super

869
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:23,150
good and

870
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:26,069
we I think we're pretty close to time

871
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,459
don't want to ramble on too long we can

872
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:31,410
always do this again sometime we've got

873
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:34,709
some more classes that Russell and I

874
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:40,049
have planned to do together and I know I

875
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:41,999
have I have a public PSM in Oslo

876
00:46:40,049 --> 00:46:45,329
obviously I'll be doing remotely a

877
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:48,420
public PSM Oslo a public PSK that I'm

878
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:54,690
cool teaching with Daniel Vacanti from

879
00:46:48,420 --> 00:47:00,109
the UK time zone and I think I oh I have

880
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:03,119
our pal E in the Mexico City I'm knowing

881
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:06,420
which will be interesting between my

882
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,900
private classes do you have anything

883
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:12,089
coming up Russell that you want to add I

884
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,749
have some public classes here in the

885
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:17,700
Eastern time zone in the US and both

886
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:19,200
professional scrum master professional

887
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,769
scrum product owners so those who live

888
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,569
in the Atlanta area or select other

889
00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:27,229
cities in the Southeast United States I

890
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:32,009
didn't be happy to have you reach out my

891
00:47:27,229 --> 00:47:33,719
LinkedIn connect is Russell a Miller so

892
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:35,759
you can message me through LinkedIn

893
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:37,559
that's a good way to contact me or you

894
00:47:35,759 --> 00:47:40,859
can also find me on the scrum org

895
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:53,789
website those are two methods people can

896
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:58,709
use to to reach out oh absolutely and I

897
00:47:53,789 --> 00:48:00,839
think that we both are going to be

898
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:03,630
working together and over the next few

899
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:06,989
months and hopefully we'll have even

900
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:08,249
more learnings the next ones that we're

901
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:11,009
working together on is going to be our

902
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:13,289
professional scrum foundations but not

903
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:16,109
the next one I'm doing which is on

904
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:18,599
Monday Tuesday because you're busy so

905
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:21,420
hopefully that will be yeah that's the

906
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,239
way it goes and hopefully that will all

907
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:27,150
work out well and we'll both know a

908
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,490
little bit more about how to do this

909
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:33,300
crazy thing

910
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:36,390
a live virtual classrooms when we get

911
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:41,220
there okay thanks very much Russell for

912
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:44,700
for for coming on Martin it was a

913
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:46,500
