1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,580
so the question is what is a Sprint

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,219
backlog

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,500
uh so according to the scrum guide a

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,800
Sprint backlog is is kind of three

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,859
things together the first is the Sprint

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,820
goal uh the second is the selected

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,680
backlog items and the third is a plan to

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,439
complete them some kind of some kind of

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
plan for that those three together is

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,020
the the Sprint backlog

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,579
uh my my perspective is that the the

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,899
Sprint backlog is our transparency of

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,180
the present

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,160
right it's how do we know what are we

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,399
working on just now how do we know where

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,219
we are in our progress towards our our

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,320
current Sprint goal and ultimately our

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,920
overall product goal

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,379
um so the the Sprint backlog is

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,360
made up of all of the things that we're

21
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,239
working on this Sprint but it's very

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:08,640
important that the Sprint backlog isn't

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:11,700
100 to do with the Sprint goal if we

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,159
always have our Sprint backlog must be

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,260
100 to do with our Sprint goal then what

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,840
do we do with all those other things

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,119
that we need to do over time perhaps

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,100
we've got some refactoring perhaps we've

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,320
got some architectural work we have to

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,180
do perhaps we've just got some bugs to

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,619
fix do we have to have a bug fixing

32
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,140
Sprint right that's where that

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,579
dysfunction comes from so what you do

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,640
instead is your your your Sprint goal

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,159
encompasses some of your Sprint backlog

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,320
this is the thing that you commit to the

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,540
thing that you're definitely definitely

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,220
going to try really hard to achieve

39
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
right because that commitment try really

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,280
hard to achieve that's the thing you're

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,540
definitely the thing you'll talk to your

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,880
customers about talk to your

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,920
stakeholders about engage with them on

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,479
that that topic and then there's a bunch

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,040
of other things that you're going to

46
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,500
bring into the Sprint that are perhaps

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
nothing to do with the Sprint goal you

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,460
might have

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,280
um some some refactoring work you might

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,259
have some technical debt you want to go

51
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,660
want to go fix

52
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,340
um you might have here's some stuff that

53
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,379
we haven't automated in a while and we

54
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,379
want to want to go back and and fix that

55
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,840
up uh perhaps you've got oh the build

56
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,879
the build's taking too long

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,040
um and we really need to go re-engineer

58
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,420
that thing so that it's it's faster and

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,819
our Engineers know quicker that

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,940
something's wrong that's all work that

61
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,540
needs to be done that doesn't fit within

62
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,760
a Sprint goal because a Sprint goal is

63
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,160
always talking about what the customers

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,319
need what the stakeholders need what are

65
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,580
we trying to trying to deliver for for

66
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,680
for them

67
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,420
the rest is business as usual right

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,459
stuff we have to do all the time so

69
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,099
that's included in that story

70
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,280
so try and avoid having a Sprint goal

71
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,200
that is so big

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,280
that you can achieve it

73
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,440
right any team that is working towards a

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Sprint goal and then they can't achieve

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,739
it is not going to be happy right

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
hopefully they're not going to be happy

77
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,580
I'm not happy that I wasn't able to

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,140
achieve the thing that I committed to

79
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,180
try and Achieve to achieve to the

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,819
customers that wouldn't make me happy

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,440
what if the the the the are in the

82
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,900
position of doing that Sprint after

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,760
Sprint after Sprint after Sprint they're

84
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,860
not delivering because the Sprint goes

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,540
always too big it's complete these 10

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,560
things and you only get six of them done

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,620
so we failed or it's do this big thing

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,200
and we got 90 of the wear so we failed

89
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,840
right if we're constantly failing you're

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,819
gonna have a unhappy depressed team and

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,700
unhappy depressed people don't make good

92
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,739
products they don't make good decisions

93
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,480
uh they tend to not give a crap about

94
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,700
what it is you're building anymore at

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,879
some point and we don't want to go there

96
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,700
so create set them up for success by

97
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,040
having a Sprint goal that has a narrower

98
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,840
Focus right not the whole Sprint just

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,379
part of the Sprint so we know we can

100
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,180
achieve it and then add other things

101
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,159
that are much more flexible right

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,540
whether we do half the refactoring or

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,220
all the refactoring is kind of

104
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,599
irrelevant as long as we do some of it

105
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,239
and make progress

106
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,280
we've got that Sprint goal and don't be

107
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,620
afraid to change what you're working on

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,600
during the Sprint right you can accept

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,280
new work into the Sprint that's the

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,960
other reason you have that flexibility

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,820
right you have that Sprint goal that's

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,380
smaller is you can bring other work into

113
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,199
the Sprint you can change what you're

114
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,639
working on and we can respond to the

115
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,919
needs of the business the needs of the

116
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,500
customer that needs of the market much

117
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,639
more quickly that's what a Sprint goal

118
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,680
is

119
