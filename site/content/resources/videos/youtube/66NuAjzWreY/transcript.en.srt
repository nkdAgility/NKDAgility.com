1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,759
evidence-based

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:08,559
management is the

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,920
application of evidence-based practices

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,840
at the Strategic and tactical levels in

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,560
an

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:20,519
organization it involves using data to

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,680
inform but not control the actions and

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:28,519
behaviors that have been shown to impact

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,480
outcomes so what that

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,840
means is that um we're going to we're

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,559
going to collect a bunch of data within

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,600
the

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,360
organization the way we measure

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,719
people informs the way they

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,680
behave so when whenever you're working

16
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,079
within an organization and you find

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,280
somebody's working against you or

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,239
somebody's not um being as involved as

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,719
they you think they should be involved

20
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,320
and you're wondering why there's

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,159
probably some organizational measure or

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,680
metric something being levied against

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:13,119
them um levied on them that that enables

24
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,960
that behavior that enables ensures

25
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,360
encourages that that behavior in in that

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,000
person so the best way to figure

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,640
out why somebody is doing something in a

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,079
particular way that maybe you feel has a

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
negative impact on the way your things

30
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,880
need to happen

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,640
is to figure out how how they're

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,119
measured right uh uh that that can be

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,280
difficult but if you can glean that

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,840
information you can figure out why

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,759
they're behaving the way they're

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,360
behaving why they're taking the actions

37
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,920
that they're taking um and we want to

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,399
try and have more behaviors and actions

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,360
that impact our outcomes positively

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,640
right we want to deliver more value to

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,520
our customers we want to

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,479
um what other outcomes might might your

43
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,640
business want well they might might want

44
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:12,200
more Revenue um they might want more

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,720
value for their customers um they might

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,840
want uh uh to save money uh what else

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,280
might be good impactful outcomes for our

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,640
business we might we might um want to

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,680
increase our capability within a

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,319
particular market right being a little

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,400
vague but um it's difficult without a

52
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,319
specific instance to have a specific

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,480
outcome that you're trying to achieve

54
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,800
right so once once you've figured out

55
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,720
what your outcomes are you need to

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,200
figure out what metrics are going to

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,599
help you measure progress towards those

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
outcomes so I mean these can be super

59
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,680
tactical things that help you move

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,959
towards those outcomes it can be leading

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
or lagging measures there's all kinds of

62
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,840
things uh that come into that but

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,640
evidence-based

64
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,440
management is that

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,440
application of practices within the

66
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,799
context of that data to help you make

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,080
decisions and I one of the reasons I

68
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:27,120
very specifically uh said inform but not

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:30,159
control is that the data is not always

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,519
going to result in a specific action

71
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:40,720
right so um what's a good example of

72
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,400
that uh let's say I had a metric for my

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,519
for my team or teams I've got a group of

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,560
teams I'm working with and my

75
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,519
metric

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,200
um is number of live site incidents that

77
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,599
last or exist for longer than two

78
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,879
sprints three Sprints let's call three

79
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,879
Sprints right so we're running a live

80
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,120
service we're going to have outages and

81
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,360
issues and things that happen in the

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,760
live service when those things happen

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,439
we're going to create livesite incidents

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,560
right um or or Liv sight incident

85
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,320
mitigating actions right things we're

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,880
going to change in the product in order

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,079
to not have that type of Liv site

88
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
incident happen again so we've done our

89
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,960
analysis we've we've come up with these

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,479
ideas and then we expect our our metric

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,160
is that we expect teams to clear those

92
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,479
off off um within three

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,880
Sprints so if I expect them to clear it

94
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,919
off within three Sprints I maybe want to

95
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,759
have a measure a team dashboard and I'm

96
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,400
going to have a measure that says uh uh

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,680
what is the number of live site

98
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,639
incidents that have been existing for

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,400
longer than three Sprints and what is

100
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,000
the trend of that number right so is it

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,360
trending up or is it trending down and

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,960
you may see your list of teams and you

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,560
see the numbers and they're all good

104
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,120
apart from this one team that has these

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,160
four outstanding Liv site issues that

106
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,680
have been there for longer than let's

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,280
say they've been there for six or seven

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Sprints

109
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,520
right that doesn't mean there's

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,919
something wrong in that team these are

111
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,759
indications these are flags pieces of

112
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,039
evidence that you use to inform your

113
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,280
decision making so you'll probably need

114
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,039
to go ask them how it's going and maybe

115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,720
there's a team that that they're waiting

116
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,600
on something else to happen they can't

117
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,600
fix their thing until some other third

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,280
party that they don't control and we

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,759
have no well limited influence over um

120
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,919
we can go shout at them right that's

121
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,960
influence uh but we have limited

122
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,479
influence over um needs to do something

123
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
so we can't make them do it they're

124
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,319
going to do it in their own time it's on

125
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
their backlog it keeps getting pushed

126
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,840
and we we can't resolve our issue until

127
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
they've resolved their stuff that they

128
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,759
need to do

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,280
so the team that data looks bad but the

130
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,160
team's doing fine they're they're

131
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,080
chasing it on a regular basis they're uh

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
putting pressure on that other group on

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,199
a continuous basis um it's just taking

134
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,400
time to get to get resolved so that's

135
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,759
why it informs but does not

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,759
control

137
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,199
um but we're making decisions B based on

138
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,360
the evidence we're collecting a bunch of

139
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,479
evidence we're extrapolating what we

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,759
don't know or don't understand right the

141
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,560
evidence is going to have gaps in it and

142
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,800
then we're making an informed decision

143
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,120
based on our understanding of the

144
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,440
current situation and that's

145
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,280
evidence-based management right um in a

146
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,280
nutshell
