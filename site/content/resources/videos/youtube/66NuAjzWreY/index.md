# Introduction to Evidence Based Management

Understanding Evidence-Based Management (EBM)

---

📘 Introduction to Evidence-Based Management (EBM)

- What is EBM?
  - Evidence-based management (EBM) applies data-driven practices at both strategic and tactical levels in an organization.
  - It focuses on using data to **inform** decisions, rather than control them, ensuring that actions positively impact outcomes.

🧠 Key Concepts in EBM

1. 📊 Data-Driven Decision Making*
   - EBM is about collecting **evidence** within an organization to understand how actions and behaviors are affecting outcomes.
   - It's essential to understand that **how people are measured** affects their behaviors. For instance, if someone’s behavior seems counterproductive, it could be driven by organizational metrics that encourage that behavior.

2. 🔄 Focus on Positive Outcomes
   - The goal of EBM is to foster behaviors that **positively impact outcomes**, such as increased customer value, revenue growth, or cost savings.
   - Organizations must clearly define their desired outcomes, then measure progress towards those goals with appropriate metrics.

Best Practices in EBM

1. 📊 Inform, Don’t Control
   - Metrics should **inform** decisions, not dictate them. Data can provide insights but should not be treated as absolute truth without further investigation.
   - Example: A team might have unresolved live site incidents for several sprints. This could be due to external dependencies beyond their control, not because of inefficiency.

2. 🔍 Leading and Lagging Metrics:
   - **Leading metrics** help predict future outcomes, while **lagging metrics** reflect past performance. A combination of both helps teams make more informed decisions about how to move forward.
   
3. 📈 Track Progress and Trends:
   - Analyzing trends in data, such as the number of unresolved issues over time, can provide valuable insights. However, understanding the context behind the numbers is critical to avoid misinterpreting the data.

⚖️ Making Informed Decisions

1. 📉 Data Gaps and Extrapolation:
   - It’s important to recognize that data will often have gaps, and informed decisions need to be made with the best available evidence.
   - Teams need to gather **as much evidence as possible** and then make educated assumptions about areas with incomplete data.

2. 🛠 Example of Using EBM:
   - A company may set a metric around clearing live site incidents within three sprints. If a team hasn’t resolved an issue in six sprints, the data **informs** that there’s a delay, but it doesn’t mean the team is at fault. Further investigation might reveal that external factors are causing the delay.

🌟 Conclusion: The Value of Evidence-Based Management

- Informed, Not Controlled:
   - EBM helps organizations make **evidence-informed decisions**, taking into account the complexity of real-world situations where data alone doesn’t provide the full story.
   
- Driving Positive Outcomes:
   - By focusing on metrics that align with **desired outcomes**, such as customer value and operational efficiency, organizations can make better decisions that drive long-term success.

- **EBM in a Nutshell**:
   - EBM is about collecting evidence, understanding the broader context, and making informed decisions that positively impact organizational outcomes.
