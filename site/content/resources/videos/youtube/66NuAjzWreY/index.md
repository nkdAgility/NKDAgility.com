## **What is Evidence-Based Management?**

**Evidence-Based Management (EBM)** is the strategic use of data to inform decision-making processes at both the strategic and tactical levels of an organization. Itâ€™s about using data as a guideâ€”not a dictatorâ€”to shape behaviors and drive outcomes that benefit your business.

In essence, itâ€™s not about letting numbers rule your every move; instead, you gather data to **inform your actions** and **understand the behaviors** that impact the results. Letâ€™s dive into how EBM can transform your approach to management and decision-making.

* * *

## **Why Data Matters (But Shouldnâ€™t Control)**

**Data informs behaviors.** The way you measure your team's performance has a direct impact on how they behave. Ever encountered someone in your organization who seems to be working against the teamâ€™s goals or is less engaged than expected? ðŸ¤” Often, it's not a personal issueâ€”itâ€™s about the metrics theyâ€™re being judged on.

### **Hereâ€™s Why That Happens:**

- Metrics and measures often **influence individual behaviors**.

- People respond to the metrics that are used to evaluate them.

- Understanding these metrics can help you see why a person or team acts in a particular way.

**Pro tip:** If you notice a team member's actions aren't aligning with your expectations, dig into the metrics they are held accountable for. It can provide clarity on why they behave the way they do.

* * *

## **Using Metrics to Drive Positive Outcomes**

### **Step 1: Define Your Desired Outcomes**

Before diving into metrics, you need to establish **what outcomes you want to achieve**. Here are some common business outcomes you might aim for:

- ðŸ“ˆ **Increased revenue**

- ðŸ’¡ **Enhanced [value delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}})** to customers

- ðŸ’µ **Cost savings**

- ðŸš€ **Expanding market capabilities**

Without a clear understanding of your desired outcomes, itâ€™s challenging to select metrics that guide your organization in the right direction.

### **Step 2: Identify Metrics That Measure Progress**

Once you have your outcomes defined, the next step is to **identify metrics** that can help you measure progress towards those goals. These metrics can be either:

- **Leading indicators**: Metrics that predict future outcomes.

- **Lagging indicators**: Metrics that show the results after the actions have been taken.

### **Example of a Useful Metric**

Letâ€™s say your organization is running a live service and you want to minimize service outages. A valuable metric might be:

- **Number of live site incidents** that exist for longer than three sprints.

By tracking this, you can monitor whether issues are being resolved promptly and identify any trends. For instance, if most teams resolve issues quickly but one team struggles with incidents lingering beyond six or seven sprints, itâ€™s a flag to investigate further. ðŸš©

* * *

## **Informing Decisions Without Over-Controlling**

One of the key tenets of EBM is that data should **inform, not control**. Metrics provide signals, not absolute truths. For example, if you notice a team lagging in clearing incidents, itâ€™s not always a sign of failure. Itâ€™s a signal that calls for deeper exploration.

### **A Real-World Scenario**

Imagine a team has unresolved incidents beyond the typical three-sprint window. This doesnâ€™t automatically mean theyâ€™re underperforming. They might be:

- Waiting on actions from a **third-party** they have limited influence over.

- Dealing with **external dependencies** that are slowing down their resolution process.

In such cases, the team might be doing everything rightâ€”**chasing the issue, applying pressure**, and keeping it on their radarâ€”but progress is slow due to factors outside their control. ðŸ“…

The takeaway? **Data informs but doesnâ€™t dictate.** Use it as a conversation starter to understand the challenges your teams face.

## **Making Data-Driven Decisions: A Balanced Approach**

### **The Process of Evidence-Based Decision-Making**

1. **Collect Data**: Gather quantitative and qualitative data from your teams.

3. **Analyze the Metrics**: Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

5. **Ask Questions**: Use the data as a basis to ask deeper questions about whatâ€™s happening.

7. **Make Informed Decisions**: Apply your findings to make decisions that align with your desired outcomes.

### **Why Metrics Have Gaps (And How to Bridge Them)**

Data doesnâ€™t always tell the whole story. There will be **gaps and unknowns**. The key is to **extrapolate from what you do know** and make informed assumptions about the rest. Think of it like putting together a puzzleâ€”sometimes, you need to infer the missing pieces.

### **Practical Tips for Implementing EBM**

- **Create a dashboard** to track key metrics for your teams.

- **Review metrics regularly** to spot trends early.

- **Engage your teams in the process**, allowing them to understand how their work impacts the metrics and outcomes.

## **Transforming Your Organization with Evidence-Based Management**

### **The Benefits of EBM**

By adopting an evidence-based approach, your organization can enjoy several benefits:

- ðŸš€ **Better alignment** between [strategic goals]({{< ref "/tags/strategic-goals" >}}) and day-to-day actions.

- ðŸ’¬ **Improved communication** as data becomes a common language for decision-making.

- ðŸŽ¯ **Focus on value** rather than arbitrary targets, leading to more meaningful progress.

- ðŸ§  **More empowered teams**, as they understand the rationale behind decisions and can adapt their actions accordingly.

### **Personal Advice from the Field**

As a [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Trainer, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand the transformative power of EBM in organizations. Itâ€™s not about hitting a specific number every timeâ€”itâ€™s about using data to **guide meaningful conversations** and **adjust your course** when needed.

Remember, itâ€™s okay if the data doesnâ€™t always tell you what you want to hear. ðŸ“Š Itâ€™s a tool to help you get closer to your goals, not a measure of your worth or your teamâ€™s value.

* * *

## **Final Thoughts: Using Data to Inform, Not Dictate**

**Evidence-Based Management** is all about balance. You want to leverage data to improve your organizationâ€™s outcomes, but without letting those numbers control your every move. Focus on the bigger picture:

- **Define your outcomes** clearly.

- **Choose metrics** that align with those goals.

- **Use data to inform**â€”not dictateâ€”your decisions.

By following this approach, you can create a culture where data is a trusted advisor, not a demanding boss. This shift can lead to better decisions, more engaged teams, and ultimately, **greater value delivery** for your customers. ðŸš€ Now, go forth and let data be your guideâ€”not your master!
