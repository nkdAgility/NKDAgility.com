1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,520
so I first encountered Azure devops back

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,920
in

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,839
2006 so that's quite some time ago it

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,119
wasn't called aure devops back then it

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:20,560
was um Visual Studio team Services back

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,960
in the day it's gone through many name

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,800
changes since then uh but it's

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,440
effectively it's not the same service

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,079
but it's the same intent from the

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,360
service um so as your devops is

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,800
something that I've been using since

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,719
then and I I was a lowly software

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,480
engineer um plugging away building some

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:52,199
products and as your devops was really

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:57,079
my root into into devops into helping

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:01:00,399
teams become better at what they do um

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,799
use increase their capabilities

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,640
use um tools to help them uh better

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,040
their capabilities right um because team

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Foundation server was was intending to

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,880
that be that tool I I think it it

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,520
largely struggled to do anything outside

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,200
of the Microsoft space until they moved

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,920
much further on to to Azure devops the

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:29,079
cloud version but

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,360
um that early product was actually as

27
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:35,759
how I got my Microsoft MVP as well which

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,759
was building plugins and uh playing

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,000
around with the apis for um for

30
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,520
TFS um so I I worked with a number of

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,200
teams uh Team some teams at maril Lynch

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,479
and then some teams at agreco and are in

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,960
both

34
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,600
circumstances while also

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:04,320
doing the work I helped those teams

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,560
understand um how to do automated builds

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,080
how to um use the work item tracking how

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,200
to link all the things together um I

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
built some visualization tools against

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,120
the against the apis so I've really been

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,879
plugging away at the Azure devops um

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,519
apis since

43
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,000
2006 um so I know where a lot of the

44
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:30,400
bodies are buried in the apis which is

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,200
why when um I think

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,599
what happened I I got my MVP I moved to

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,159
the US I worked as a devops consultant

48
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,239
almost exclusively in the Microsoft

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,920
stack but as a devops consultant in the

50
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,159
US for three years so I was doing a lot

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
of azure devops work um we did a lot of

52
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:54,080
API work there were some migrations

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,000
there used to be this old tool um that

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,840
was

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,319
totally crazy to work with um I'm trying

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
TR remember what it was called Microsoft

57
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,080
created it originally but really it was

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:13,879
just a big ass code base and it allowed

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,720
you to migrate data from uh um TFS to to

60
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,120
to other TFS but it had this kind of

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,200
adapter model so that you could get from

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,159
other systems into TFS that was the idea

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,159
um so I think I'm the only

64
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,760
one I I I would hedge I certainly the

65
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,000
only one that

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,400
published um creating their own adapter

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,840
for it so I did uh created a migrator

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,400
for Test Track Pro into TFS um back in

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
the day when Test Track Pro was even a

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,640
thing and maybe it is still a thing I've

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,519
just not heard about it in in 15 20

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,439
years but um that

73
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,599
that experience of creating that adapter

74
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,480
really led me when I invite the UK

75
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,879
started my own business what my first

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,239
gigs was with um a company called

77
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,760
Slumber and Slumber was consolidating

78
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,840
they need a lot of devops help um to to

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,840
help make the most out of the tools that

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,600
they had uh they were using the tools

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,600
really well it was just a little bit

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,320
convoluted um so they wanted to take um

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,680
they're the sort of organization where

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,199
everybody does everything right so

85
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,240
there's there's um every tool you can

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,759
think of every Engineering Process

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,520
they have everything and they wanted to

88
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,080
consolidate down into using at least a

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
single Source control tool with work

90
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,440
item tracking and the tool they picked

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,080
was TFS team Foundation server um so I

92
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,039
helped them

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
migrate something and they had a

94
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,400
standard process template so I helped

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,759
them migrate something like four to 500

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,800
teams from what they were doing before

97
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,280
into this new model and then move them

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,360
from server to server and originally I

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,080
built a bunch of Powershell scripts

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,320
right that's when you're prototyping um

101
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,759
scripting languages are the the best way

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,479
to um kind of kind

103
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,080
of run your thought processes you're

104
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,639
effectively writing down your thought

105
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,280
process and then running it and say yeah

106
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,440
well that kind of works and if I select

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,759
this bit that kind of works and if I do

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,720
this that kind of works so it's a really

109
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,680
good way to to do some fast it's

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,960
incredibly error Pro and buggy as heck

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,720
um but it's a good way to do to do to do

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,639
those things and I built a bunch of par

113
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
shell tools that I had I think at one

114
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,240
point four or five people um else in the

115
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,960
organization running those po shells to

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
start uh migrating data around change

117
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,840
process templates move data around in

118
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,080
fields um all of those things and then I

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,080
started looking at well really this

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,360
needs to be a little bit more solid this

121
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,800
needs to be a little bit more capable it

122
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,120
needs to be something that's a little

123
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,240
bit more pluggable um um and I built the

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,800
first version of the Azure devops

125
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,240
migration

126
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,759
tools so there's kind of there's kind of

127
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,120
two ways to to do migrations in as your

128
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,400
devops one is really limited but really

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,720
powerful the other one is mine um the

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,080
one that's really limited and really

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,639
powerful um is Microsoft's own migration

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,639
tools obviously they want as many people

133
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,000
as possible to move into the cloud they

134
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,479
don't really want to be supporting and

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,520
maintain te team Foundation server or or

136
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:39,800
as your up server the on Prem

137
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,080
version of the product so um they they

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,280
they want people to move up to the cloud

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,120
so they've built a tool that if you get

140
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,319
onto almost the latest version of azure

141
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,840
devops on Prem um you can effectively

142
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,400
package up your database give it to them

143
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
there's a whole process for that but

144
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,319
package up your database it's not as

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
easy as it sounds package up your

146
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
process your database give it to them

147
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,520
and they'll import it into as your

148
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,400
devops so if you're if you're trying to

149
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,440
get into asure devops the easiest most

150
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,160
high

151
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:15,319
fidelity uh most productionize way to do

152
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,759
that is to have Microsoft Do It um they

153
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,919
provide a bunch of tools uh I've done

154
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,240
this for a bunch of customers over the

155
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,080
years tons and tons of customers uh the

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,599
biggest one was the the Slumber um

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,720
engagement where I think it was 2 2.7

158
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,840
2.8 terabytes was the collection that we

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,680
moved up to to Azure devops it was

160
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,560
pretty pretty ginormous I think they

161
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,400
became the third

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,000
largest customer using Azure devops

163
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,759
outside of Microsoft in in the

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,319
service um and it that was a huge amount

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,319
of work but it lots of smaller ones are

166
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
much easier I did one for a for a

167
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
customer where we we we did it in about

168
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,360
an hour right their database was small

169
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,720
enough they're on the lat version they

170
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,159
had control of all the servers the

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,000
passwords all the things it was small

172
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,280
enough package we just sequenced it up

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
and then they looked at the result and

174
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,680
went yep that's good let's go with that

175
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,000
and we turned off the on Prem uh version

176
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,639
so I I have uh personally done a whole

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
bunch of migrations I have a team that

178
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,840
helps with that uh we did one recently

179
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,120
that was um it's more complicated than

180
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,639
it sounds right you're not just taking

181
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,680
the Azure develops database and putting

182
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,039
it in the cloud Microsoft have to to

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,599
process it in um

184
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,360
so you have

185
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,640
to you have you have to be on a version

186
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,800
that's supported by that process which

187
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,800
is the absolute latest version and one

188
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,959
back so one Service Pack back which

189
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,920
means that if you're sitting with a

190
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:56,399
local team Foundation server and you're

191
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:59,480
on TFS 2010 uh 201 I don't know 12

192
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,880
2015 uh what else was there 18 I think I

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,160
think there was a 19 maybe there was a

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,440
19 uh but if you're on a on prep server

195
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,480
you have to upgrade it first which means

196
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
that you might need to upgrade SQL

197
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Server you might need to upgrade the

198
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,480
operating system you might have to do

199
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,040
all of those things so we did one

200
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:20,360
recently for a customer that was TFS

201
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,839
2010 I think they were on 2010 all the

202
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,360
way up to Azure devops and there there

203
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,120
were

204
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,680
three distinct migrations we had to do

205
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,000
cuz you youve got to upgrade from 2010

206
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,560
to 2015 then you've got to go from 2015

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,399
to I think you can get to the latest

208
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,160
version from 2015 up to the latest

209
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,720
version of TFS then you have to run and

210
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,120
validate all the things that you need to

211
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,360
do to go to the go to the cloud then you

212
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,040
can take your your your environment into

213
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,160
the cloud and that can go one of two

214
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,680
ways you can just take the database if

215
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,079
it's small enough it's under 150 Meg you

216
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,120
can just give them the database that

217
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:00,800
pack and it'll work uh but otherwise you

218
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,079
have to set up in a euro environment you

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
have to install the data the SQL Server

220
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:09,920
upload data and then get Microsoft to to

221
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,480
to do stuff with it so that that that is

222
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,079
that is the easiest simplest and most

223
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:21,360
productionize route uh but it's not what

224
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,760
a lot of people can or want to do um

225
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
lots of companies have lots of

226
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,920
circumstances that are out with the

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,800
bounds of that um they' they've got 100

228
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,560
teams and only five teams want to go to

229
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,360
the cloud they've got other teams that

230
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,320
can't want whatever reason um that then

231
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,920
adds complexity to that mix uh they've

232
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,639
got teams that want to go just now and

233
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,399
other teams that want to go

234
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:49,000
later um those are the most common ones

235
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,240
for for for for that pushup into we're

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,120
going to Ado um but also you've got

237
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,120
companies that sell products right so if

238
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,000
you've got five products in your company

239
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,279
and one of those products is being sold

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,639
it's probably inside of the same TFS or

241
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,839
as your Devo and you want to move that

242
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,959
piece over to somewhere else because

243
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
you're selling it to somebody and

244
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,040
they're going to take the history um and

245
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,959
all of the the the the stuff that goes

246
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,600
along with it um and Microsoft provide

247
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,920
no support for any of those scenarios um

248
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,160
so if you've got you've got I've got 50

249
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,959
projects and I want one I've got

250
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,040
projects across five collections and I

251
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,839
want one collection at one count or um

252
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,639
I've

253
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
got I don't know I created one big

254
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,200
massive project and I really should have

255
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
created two projects these are things

256
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,120
that are just not fundamentally

257
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,720
supported by the by the tool or by or or

258
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:51,600
or in any productionize way by

259
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:57,480
Microsoft so what my tool that I created

260
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:01,639
does is it allows you to migrate pieces

261
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,440
of your whole thing to another location

262
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,160
um so we do our query based so it's

263
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,000
predominantly focused on work items

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,680
although there's lots of other tools in

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,360
there in the it's like a Swiss army

266
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,240
knife um and the people are adding new

267
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,079
tools all the time but the main I don't

268
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,360
know the knife part the main tool that

269
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
you use or is it the scissors right

270
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,639
because that's the main tool you use on

271
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,320
a Swiss army knife but anyway whatever

272
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,760
the main tool is um is is work item

273
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,880
migration because that's the thing

274
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,279
that's just not out there um so you're

275
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,800
basically saying here's a query I want

276
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,000
these work items and I want them

277
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,800
recreated over here and the tool goes

278
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,959
and recreates them um so there are lots

279
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,560
of limitations lots of caveats lots of

280
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,320
things around that but that's

281
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,040
effectively the idea so I quite often

282
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,199
get asked to help customers in a variety

283
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,120
of different ways sometimes they want to

284
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:04,880
do the migration if they've got loads of

285
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:08,120
migrations to do um I I've got people

286
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,360
out there that have been using my tools

287
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,680
for

288
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,920
years um and it makes sense if you're

289
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,800
going to use the tools like big big uh

290
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,560
Enterprise customers find quite often

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,279
they need to move data from one place to

292
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,440
another they want to consolidate they

293
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:28,320
want to split so they spin up a a group

294
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,240
of people probably the administrators of

295
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,720
as your devops for their company that

296
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,160
that they want to spin up on the tool

297
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
and use the tool um so I provide them

298
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,839
with a bunch of support sometimes it's

299
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,680
just support calls sometimes it's

300
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,480
training they want to train some people

301
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,519
on on using the tool but more often than

302
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,399
not with lots of organizations it's a

303
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,519
one-off thing right we're going here we

304
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,880
want this to happen and we just want it

305
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,600
to happen we don't want to have to we

306
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,320
don't need that skill in house if it's

307
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,759
not your core business you're not doing

308
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
it all the time and you don't need it to

309
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,920
support your core business then that's

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,120
when you Outsource right um and I did a

311
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,000
big migration recently of about 80

312
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,759
880,000 work items for a customer that

313
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,759
wanted an audit Trail right so they've

314
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,800
they've bought another company they've

315
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,839
not got their hands on all of that

316
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,279
company's stuff yet there still all the

317
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,440
legal stuff that has to happen in

318
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,360
between but they want a copy of all the

319
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,199
work items and all the code so that

320
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
their then audit Department can then go

321
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,720
through all of that and and and validate

322
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,920
and check and match things up and yes

323
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,480
this is the right thing and all all this

324
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,920
is missing and that's missing all the I

325
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,279
don't know what they're doing right but

326
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,720
they wanted that copy so they don't want

327
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,320
to mess around having their own people

328
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,720
learn a tool and then do it so we just

329
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,600
did it for them um probably took eight

330
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,079
or 9 days to migrate actual 24 hours uh

331
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,199
running on it to migrate that number of

332
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,839
of work items because it's a lot um but

333
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,759
then after it's it's done they have that

334
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,279
copy in the new location and they can do

335
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,240
their own thing so sometimes we do the

336
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,440
migrations sometimes we help support the

337
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,880
migrations sometimes we help train

338
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,040
people um and sometimes we just consult

339
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,079
I I quite often um get calls from folks

340
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,560
that just need some advice on how to do

341
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:29,639
something in asure devops

342
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,279
um these big infrastructure

343
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,959
ideas that people have the business

344
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,279
decid they want to consolidate stuff

345
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:37,519
they want to split stuff they want to

346
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,240
move stuff around like what does that

347
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,880
mean for us what are our options what

348
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,000
are our capabilities so I quite often

349
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,199
have have uh um discussions with

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,639
customers on how how that all goes

351
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,480
together and sometimes they use my

352
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,079
services to help them and sometimes they

353
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,000
have enough information to go do it on

354
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,639
their own or it's easy enough that it's

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,440
just following the docs from

356
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:06,079
Microsoft um

357
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,880
so as both a user of aure devops which I

358
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,160
have been for many years although not so

359
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,079
much anymore right um I do a lot of my

360
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,839
work in GitHub now but as a user of aure

361
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,519
devops um I really appreciate the the

362
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,720
capabilities that it has but then there

363
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,639
are some gaps that you need um somebody

364
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,160
to fill and um sometimes you want to

365
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,759
spin it up yourself and sometimes you

366
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,839
need to kind of get somebody in to help

367
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:37,360

368
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,360
