    "ai_penalties_applied": true,
    "ai_penalty_points": 2,
    "ai_penalty_details": "mentions and alignment penalized 1 point each due to outdated references to early TFS/VSTS, no agentic intelligence content, and content scope being limited to traditional DevOps migration and scripting practices.",
    "final_score": 18.0,
    "reasoning": "The content is a memoir on the evolution of Azure DevOps from TFS to the present, focusing on migration, scripting, tooling, and training. There is no explicit mention of autonomous AI agents, context-aware intelligence, or human-agent synergy. The closest topics—API integrations, custom scripting, process automation—reflect traditional DevOps but lack agentic principles (agency in AI, autonomous workflows, embedded intelligence). The content's intent (sharing DevOps lessons/tips) is moderately relevant to broader software delivery topics, but does not align with the definition of Agentic Software Delivery. A penalty is applied for referencing legacy practices and tools (early TFS, manual scripting) without connecting to modern agentic strategies. The only partial alignment is that the audience (DevOps practitioners) might be interested in agentic delivery in principle.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content focuses on DevOps migration, scripting, and consulting around Azure DevOps/TFS. It lacks discussion of autonomous AI agents, agency, or context-aware workflows—therefore, it fits Agentic Software Delivery only marginally, if at all.",
    "level": "Ignored"
