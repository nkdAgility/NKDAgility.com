1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so we have about 15 minutes left

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,870
for the folks that know what they're

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,920
doing and I can see most folks are now

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,050
in the way I would expect and as an

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,660
indication of whether you're in

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,849
correctly the two things for you to go

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,310
and check the first one is the drop-down

8
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:29,160
list at the top of your team's it should

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,490
say naked agility with Martin into it

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,650
also when you go into the show

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,590
participants yes

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,230
d-ohh were you just playing around with

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,730
the hand raised functionality I was

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,670
going to explain that in just a second

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,680
also when you roll over somebody you

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,860
should see their presence information

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,140
rather than Victor's fixed himself as

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,690
well and it would just be blank

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,250
and just so the name at the top rather

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,590
than show the presence information so

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,410
that shows that everything's set up and

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,890
configured correctly for all the people

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,909
that are here just now maybe Oh bagel

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,299
everybody's managed to get it organized

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,030
so awesome so that's like two ways to

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,740
check is one check the drop-down list at

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,850
the top and the other one is to check

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,249
your presence information there so

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,350
during the class we're going to we're

30
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,509
not going to use the chat so much most

31
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,600
of its going to be variable

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,880
communication we're going to have a

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,880
bunch of interactive sessions and we're

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,679
all going to work in teams and in those

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,799
teams we're going to work on a little

36
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:45,600
project that I have you are going to be

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,670
asked to create some output from those

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,619
projects and so you'll be working

39
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,929
together interactively creating a little

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,659
bit of software you're going to choose

41
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:59,069
what technology you use so use whatever

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,590
you are happy with and in that obviously

43
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,959
a development team is made up of many

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,450
different people so some of you will be

45
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,459
coders some of you will be testers some

46
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,220
of you will be project managers some of

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,740
you will have all different skills UX

48
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,660
whatever that happens to be and so

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,210
you'll be asked the star

50
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,470
of the session on Monday and to break

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,540
down into cross-functional teams once

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,800
we've broken down into those

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,290
cross-functional teams you'll see

54
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,810
there's a teams at button on the far

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,980
left here if you click on that and

56
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,100
you'll be able to click on it just now

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,800
you should see something similar to what

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,380
I see but obviously with less classy

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,960
setup you'll see this live virtual PSF

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,970
for workday in Dublin that might be the

61
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,420
only one that you see just now and

62
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,640
you'll see this one after the class or

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,870
when I run my scripts to set everything

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,240
up for the after the class part and when

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,850
you're here you can see the two channels

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,910
that are set up once the general channel

67
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,030
and one's the team one tech check you

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,370
can see that there is meeting currently

69
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,000
running in general by virtue of this

70
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,280
little icon here and when you go into

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,830
when you're viewing the posts of that

72
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,930
channel here and you can see that the

73
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,790
live tech check it's being recorded

74
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,040
who's in the meeting how long it's been

75
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,040
going and you can just join it straight

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,540
from this view and that that the

77
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,610
recording will be listed here as well

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,190
but I may need to go download that

79
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,740
process it and put it somewhere else for

80
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,290
you and because there's some some weird

81
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,440
issues with that and and you can see

82
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,670
that the main meeting that I set up for

83
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,860
the classes on Monday and Tuesday are is

84
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,020
set up here as well so this will just

85
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,520
have that join button on it so when you

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,890
come into the team you can just go to

87
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,860
general and you can just join if the

88
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,140
meetings not started yet like you come

89
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,990
in early I doubt you'll be earlier than

90
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,670
me but if you do come in early you'll be

91
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,070
able to just come in here hit the join

92
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,820
button and it will start it and I've

93
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:11,100
enabled this that everybody who has

94
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,130
permission to this team again it's

95
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,040
authenticated so only you folks will be

96
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,290
able to get in and you have permission

97
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,660
to start those events and do all of

98
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,920
those things I will have a

99
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,930
co-facilitator

100
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,490
on Monday Russell he's not here today

101
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,229
because it's still

102
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,599
30 a.m. for him and he's in Atlanta but

103
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,569
he's going to join us get up early and

104
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:43,470
join us from Monday and Tuesday classes

105
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:45,960
to help out with the facilitation so

106
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,660
what if you notice in the general tab

107
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,840
there are at the general channel sorry

108
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:54,660
there are a number of tabs and just to

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,569
be helpful I've added the scrum open

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,440
assessment and the scrum guide right in

111
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:03,150
here so feel free to read from here and

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,349
if you want to start a conversation you

113
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:11,880
can actually tag me in that conversation

114
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:14,940
and if you well maybe I can't tag myself

115
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,880
but if you type at Martin you should see

116
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,919
me pop up in that list and you'll be

117
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,539
able to tag me and I'll get a

118
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,590
notification on my phone and I'll be

119
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,120
able to come and answer any questions

120
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,389
you have so if you're reading this gum

121
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,870
guide before it's not required it's

122
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,729
recommended so if you are reading it you

123
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,009
can ping me any questions that you have

124
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:37,409
as you're going through obviously will

125
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:40,469
answer most of them in the class but

126
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:45,810
anything you can preempt is always

127
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:48,570
useful and so while we're running the

128
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,060
class what I will have over here and I

129
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,000
have team one tech check I'm actually

130
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,880
going to I'm just going to start an

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,979
event in here and for that team so that

132
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,479
team will have our open channel all day

133
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,370
and you'll be able to switch between the

134
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:11,099
two channels so let me just quickly open

135
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:13,370
it and if I do team one tech check so

136
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,810
this is what will be up here and when I

137
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,810
click meet now I'm going to get

138
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:23,940
disconnected and from from from you guys

139
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:28,370
I'll leave come back in and show you how

140
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,370
this bit works hold on a second

141
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,270
okay so let me share my screen again

142
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:53,930
okay can everybody see my screen again

143
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,910
yep yeah thank you for that feedback so

144
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,200
on the left hand side remember we had

145
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,170
the little light on the general tab we

146
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,600
now also have a little light on the team

147
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:06,470
one and I go in and there's the the team

148
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,600
one chat any of you in your team can

149
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:13,130
just go start that by clicking meat now

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,930
obviously nominate one person rather

151
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,570
than have everybody click it because it

152
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,400
will create separate meetings but once

153
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,470
it's been created it will be listed in

154
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,770
this channel and you can actually just

155
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:27,020
leave it open okay so you'll notice up

156
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,900
here that I have team one tech check on

157
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,660
hold and I have a little play button to

158
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,930
resume the call and I also have a hang

159
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:38,120
up button if I don't hang up when I

160
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,300
switch between roles it just leaves them

161
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,640
open and puts the other call on hold and

162
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,920
so we're gonna spend some amount of time

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:52,550
in the main room which is in the general

164
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:56,030
tab and then when we have exercises

165
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,610
maybe we have an exercise around moving

166
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,100
some stickies around or creating some

167
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:05,300
information or working on your sprint

168
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:09,980
you as a team will go to your team

169
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:15,140
channel connect to your team room and

170
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:17,060
have just the five people or or between

171
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,910
five and nine people depending on what

172
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,460
happens on Monday and you may have just

173
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,830
that group of people in your room and

174
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,530
you'll be able to have conversations in

175
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:31,040
isolation without everybody else at

176
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:34,220
getting in the way so that that's a how

177
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,950
we are implementing breakout rooms in

178
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,810
this tool if you've used soom and it has

179
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,380
dynamic breakout rooms this is more

180
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:44,600
self-service at breakout rooms so

181
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:51,410
they would like you to do just now and

182
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:54,740
if you can is join this a new team one

183
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:57,980
tech check at meeting as well and you

184
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,590
will then go into that meeting you'll

185
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,620
leave this one it will be put on hold

186
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,840
and and then come back and just see that

187
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,020
experience of switching between the two

188
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,420
and so that we get that smooth for

189
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,590
Monday and usually a folks have seen it

190
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,510
then it's a lot easier to grasp how that

191
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,100
works on the day and make things a

192
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,810
little bit faster and slicker and also

193
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,060
you can help out your teammates who

194
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:28,640
weren't able to make it today so do you

195
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:33,700
want to jump into that and just connect

196
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,700
in there I will give you a few minutes

197
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,160
for those that don't do that or that are

198
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,890
back already you'll see that em in each

199
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,690
room you can see who's on hold and who's

200
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,330
not if they're on hold they're in

201
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,400
another room and if they're not on hold

202
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,430
they're they're here it doesn't refresh

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,860
super quickly but mostly quickly you'll

204
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,780
see David's still listed Dave's still

205
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,430
listed as on hold but maybe he's back

206
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,500
already that means that you'll have this

207
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,330
team one and you can very you probably

208
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,280
saw the experience was super quick

209
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,220
now that you've joined that team and

210
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,680
it's open it's even quicker to switch

211
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,540
between those teams because you don't

212
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,150
need to go through that kind of audio

213
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,450
dialogue at the start so that's a very

214
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,890
quick way to jump into your breakout

215
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,870
room have a five-minute conversation

216
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,490
with your team if that's the time box

217
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,400
that we use for that conversation and

218
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,300
then come back to the main group

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,300
somebody have any questions on that

220
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:10,460
okay so that's really all of the the

221
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:14,870
tools and that we're going to use in

222
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,060
teams I know the workday is moving to

223
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,430
war on my understanding I might be wrong

224
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:24,980
is that workday is moving towards teams

225
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:27,860
as corporate standard so hopefully this

226
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,550
will help you out with that as well

227
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,950
and you'll be a have a leg up in

228
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,760
participating in those things I do want

229
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,800
to add and a couple of things that are a

230
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,470
little bit useful one of the things that

231
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,070
I'll be doing and as we run the course I

232
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:50,150
can't remember if I added tags yet did I

233
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:53,620
add tags yet manage team I did indeed

234
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:57,460
add tags so you can see oh there's

235
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,250
Jessica I will add your tag there we go

236
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,710
so I'm going to tag everybody with the

237
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,690
team that they're in once we get started

238
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,370
once you've decided which teams you're

239
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,520
going to be on and there's a

240
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,130
facilitators tag and a students tag so

241
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,300
students is going to be all of you

242
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:19,070
facilitators is going to be Russell and

243
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:22,610
I if you are in for example your team

244
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:25,520
one tech check and you pop open the chat

245
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:34,090
dialogue on the right-hand side you'll

246
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:38,240
be able to type one of those tags and

247
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,920
that everybody who is in that tag will

248
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,140
get a notification to say that there's a

249
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
new message that they need to look at

250
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,940
and I'm pretty sure it will pop up on

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,500
activity it will pop up on chat and it

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,900
might be listed under team I'm not sure

253
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,110
how that's visible for you and it would

254
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:58,280
be awesome could somebody in any chat

255
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,850
you want and tag the facilitators that

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,640
would be pretty cool so you could do it

257
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,890
in the chat for this meeting or you

258
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:12,200
could pop in here and do it in any of

259
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:14,839
either of the channels there we go so

260
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,520
I've been tagged as a facilitator and so

261
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,070
I can see I get an alert

262
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,589
I've been added in the team and it will

263
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:23,960
show me exactly which channel and I need

264
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:27,260
to go go look at yes thank you David

265
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:30,880
there we go so it makes it very easy for

266
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,960
us to see if somebody needs some help

267
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,170
because you can just tag the

268
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,420
facilitators and it also means that we

269
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,660
know where to go and it's the same for

270
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:46,100
for you folks as well what I will often

271
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:51,650
do is put time checks in your chat so

272
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:57,680
for example thank you Suresh you how'd

273
00:13:51,650 --> 00:14:01,820
you say your name it's you

274
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,400
Zuzu yeah okay I will try and remember

275
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,100
that thank you very much and you'll

276
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,000
notice that if you went into in fact

277
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,410
I'll show you over here because

278
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,570
everybody's in this room it's a little

279
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:17,930
bit easier and you can see that we

280
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:20,930
where's our current tech check there we

281
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,810
go our tech check that's online and if I

282
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:28,820
put a message in here you will see that

283
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:32,240
it will be automatically in you're in

284
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,770
the room you'll see it as our that I

285
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,510
can't remember the name of the thing the

286
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:40,430
overlay that pops up we'll have a little

287
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:42,680
chat window and if I tag students in

288
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,280
here you'll see that it's not going into

289
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,130
the main room like David's two chats

290
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,339
just went into the main channel and this

291
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:56,510
is actually going into thank you David

292
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:59,780
it's going into the reply for that if I

293
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,790
can where's my pop-up gun i minimized it

294
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,370
to keep it out the way it's actually

295
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,260
going directly into this channel so

296
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,550
you'll be able to see it there right

297
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,410
away okay

298
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,250
and so that's that's a simple way to

299
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,620
make sure that you're on time that and

300
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,300
we don't have to go chase you down by

301
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,930
switching rooms or will Russell and I

302
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,950
will do that and if the if folks aren't

303
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,750
back on the time box so we are expecting

304
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,410
you as a group to self-organize to look

305
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,390
after your own time boxes

306
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,580
we will we will help out where we can

307
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,130
and make sure everything runs as

308
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,550
smoothly as possible

309
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:43,940
so the final thing and to have a quick

310
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,290
look at which you can actually do on

311
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:51,860
your own time I'm going to put a link I

312
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:56,480
think I put a link in the email that I

313
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:03,590
sent you folks let me just check sent

314
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:06,730
items did I make one I maybe didn't cuz

315
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:09,590
I was lazy it might be in the event

316
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:14,180
sometimes I'm too lazy and I don't do

317
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:19,520
all of the bits oh no I did I did a

318
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,040
mural so in the calendar invitation

319
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,010
there was a mural link which I just put

320
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,870
in the chat which you should be able to

321
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:33,890
open I'm just going to open it just now

322
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:36,350
bring it across you should see this

323
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:39,140
experience it is perfectly fine to use

324
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,420
this anonymously and that's my

325
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:44,210
expectation for you to be able to use

326
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:51,880
enter anonymously and I'm going to sign

327
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:54,170
in which will give me a facilitator

328
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,940
experience and Russell and I will have

329
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:02,990
the same capabilities while I'm hoping

330
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:04,880
it will there we go there we go I can

331
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,360
see are loads of folks are coming in

332
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,220
already

333
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,740
I'll see you just as these little

334
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,300
anonymous shrimp lobster crab things

335
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,940
going on that's that's okay and it's not

336
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:21,230
super difficult what I will be doing if

337
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:23,720
I go to preparation and I summon

338
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,449
everybody you'll see that you will all

339
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,090
get located to what I'm looking at so

340
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,800
when we're using the mural and you can

341
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,070
have it open on your screen we don't

342
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,960
need to share anything on desktops and

343
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,540
you'll just get sucked into where we're

344
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,700
focusing and when you're in your team

345
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,750
murals which they'll be a mural for each

346
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,000
team and you'll be able to do

347
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:49,169
as well and and we're going to do

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,260
exercises using this as our as our as

349
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:54,030
our wall as our our sticky so you can

350
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,919
actually double click anywhere and

351
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:01,799
create a create a sticky so I just

352
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:04,500
created that my first sticky there if

353
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,990
you double click next to a sticky you'll

354
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,030
actually create the same type of sticky

355
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,280
if you go over on the left you'll see

356
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,960
you can create other types of sticky so

357
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm just gonna drag a pink one across

358
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,179
well is it pink or purple and somebody

359
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,669
else is editing it already but if I

360
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,070
double click next to that sticky it will

361
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,700
create another one of the same type this

362
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:28,830
is a super useful tool for facilitating

363
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,350
anything that you would in the past have

364
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,270
used a white board and stickies on a

365
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,520
white board this is this is super

366
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,760
awesome and you're not just drawing on

367
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,970
it but it does have a it does have a

368
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,030
drawing tool I've not really used it I

369
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,710
don't know how useful it is but it does

370
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,409
have such a thing so if I say done

371
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:52,559
drawing and I have this and I should be

372
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:55,110
able to drag it drag it around and

373
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,530
delete it so it makes things a little

374
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,710
bit easier you can upload pictures and

375
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:05,070
you can add little icons so you want a

376
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,530
pen or a star or you want to put a shape

377
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,510
on there you can do that as well and you

378
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,059
can make some shapes and symbols and

379
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,549
we're going to use this oh that was my

380
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:18,240
bad I clicked the wrong button where are

381
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:21,480
we PSF 2020 or 525 main PSF there we go

382
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,900
i disappeared because i clicked the

383
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,950
wrong button there we go um so we're

384
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,860
going to use this for a lot of the

385
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:35,789
exercises and feel free to play around

386
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,260
what I will do is I'm in the main mural

387
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:40,880
which is the only one you need to save

388
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:45,030
the link for um I'm going to make this

389
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,159
little display clickable oh oh yeah I'm

390
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:50,640
sharing a hint teams anyway I'll bring

391
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:54,120
everybody over someone everybody um I'm

392
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,220
going to bring put this little display

393
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,700
on each of the teams and if you double

394
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,520
click it

395
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,670
it will link through to your individual

396
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,950
team room for that team and so will do I

397
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,820
can a team-building exercise where we

398
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,500
add little pictures of ourselves and so

399
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,460
I can import an image from my computer

400
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,760
and I can just go where's my picture

401
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,740
it's in here I'm gonna put that one on

402
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:24,110
and I can put my picture on and then I

403
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,110
can just add a little caption and see

404
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,460
and then I can make it smaller and then

405
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,590
when we break into teams I can choose

406
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,990
which team I want to be on for the

407
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,520
self-organizing exercise that's that's

408
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,240
roughly how we're going to facilitate a

409
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,130
lot of the exercises and working in this

410
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,710
tool and so having a little bit of

411
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,630
familiar allottee with it is okay as you

412
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,940
can see some of you been playing around

413
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,130
with it it's not super difficult but if

414
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,840
it's something you don't know then and

415
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,840
there's a little bit going on there

416
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:10,250
there any questions on mural awesome so

417
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,250
let me stop the share

418
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,269
so you will be able to see everything

419
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,990
that's in the murals yourself you'll be

420
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:23,909
able to move around that is um if if you

421
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,919
guys want to play around in that you're

422
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:28,230
all between now and Monday I'll be

423
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,570
checking it on Monday and if I need to

424
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,519
create a new blank one I will but

425
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,259
otherwise that will be the one that we

426
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,090
use maybe I can just go clean up some of

427
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,320
the posters everybody leaves lying

428
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:42,600
around that's okay too

429
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:45,029
and really that's everything unless

430
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,480
anybody has any questions feel free to

431
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,759
raise your hand you have a have a

432
00:21:48,480 --> 00:22:04,259
question and I can call on you or just

433
00:21:50,759 --> 00:22:06,029
unmute and check out cool well it looks

434
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:09,330
like there are no questions everybody

435
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:12,570
managed to very quickly get into a state

436
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,389
where they are all in and correctly I'm

437
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:19,309
I'm super happy with that experience we

438
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:21,840
had and thirteen people in at one point

439
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,429
so that's more than half of the folks

440
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,950
from the class so hopefully we don't

441
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:29,309
have so many people and with issues if

442
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:32,129
you do know some of your colleagues who

443
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:37,230
are coming into the class and then

444
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:42,029
please ask them to either watch the

445
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:45,509
video or try and connect into teams so

446
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:47,629
that they can see at this the display

447
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:51,090
like this with naked agility at the top

448
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:54,269
and that will make the class on Monday a

449
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,070
lot much easier a lot much easier that's

450
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,440
not even English much easier at the

451
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,629
start up okay thank you very much

452
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,639
