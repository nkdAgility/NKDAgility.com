While Agile and Kanban concepts are referenced, there is no direct mention of Service Level Expectation (SLE), nor are its components (elapsed time range and probability) discussed. The only tangential mentions involve lead time and cycle time explanations, but these do not connect to SLE or reference forecasting delivery timelines with a probabilistic range as the category requires. The core ideas align only superficially, as they deal more broadly with workflow visualisation and process optimisation but not with SLE's definition, calculation, or value in Scrum/Kanban teams. The intended audience—team practitioners improving workflow visibility—is somewhat aligned with SLE topics, but the actual content does not deliver on those specifics. Therefore, depth and alignment remain low. The overall confidence that this fits the 'Service Level Expectation' category is very low.",
