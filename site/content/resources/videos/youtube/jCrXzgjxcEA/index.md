Creating an effective Caman strategy is no small feat, especially in our current hybrid work environment. As we navigate this new landscape, the need for digital tools to share our visualisations has never been more critical. One such tool that I find invaluable is Azure DevOps. Today, I want to share my insights on how to leverage Azure DevOps to visualise your work as part of a Caman strategy.

As the owner and principal consultant at Naked Agility, I’ve spent years honing my skills as a professional Scrum trainer with Scrum.org and a Kanban trainer with Pro Kanban. My experience as a Microsoft MVP in GitHub and Azure DevOps has further deepened my understanding of these tools and their applications.

### The Importance of Digital Tools

Since the pandemic, many teams have shifted away from physical offices. Even when we are in the office, not everyone is present at the same time. This absence of a physical wall or meeting room to display our work visually has made digital tools essential. Azure Boards, in particular, provides a robust platform for managing and visualising our work.

### Understanding Caman Strategy

Before diving into the specifics of Azure DevOps, it’s crucial to grasp that a Caman strategy extends beyond merely using a tool. It thrives in a stable system where everyone adheres to the same rules. However, the reality is that most of us operate in environments where individual choices can disrupt the overall system. 

#### Why Don't We Share Our Choices?

Often, we fail to recognise the significance of sharing our decisions. Those seemingly minor choices—like which item to pull or not—can have a profound impact on the entire system. We often create local optimisations that inadvertently harm the larger workflow.

### Establishing Shared Rules

To address this, I recommend gathering all participants involved in the workflow to collaboratively establish the rules they will follow. This doesn’t need to be perfect from the outset; you can adapt and refine these rules as you learn more about their impact. Starting with a rough workflow is perfectly acceptable, and you can enhance it over time.

### Setting Up Your Caman Board in Azure DevOps

Now, let’s explore how to create a Caman board for a typical software team in Azure DevOps. Here’s a step-by-step guide to managing your cards, customising your columns, and visualising your workflow.

1. **Accessing Azure DevOps**: Start by navigating to your Azure DevOps environment. You’ll find the boards and backlog options on the left-hand side, which are essential for both Caman and Scrum teams.

2. **Customising Your Board**: Click on the boards section to view your pre-set board. Here, you can customise the columns without altering the underlying work item states. This flexibility allows multiple teams to work within the same Azure DevOps project while maintaining distinct column configurations.

3. **Understanding Work Item States**: Familiarise yourself with the work item states based on the process you’ve selected—be it Agile, Scrum, or CMMI. For instance, the Scrum process typically flows from new to approved, committed, and done.

4. **Managing Work Items**: As you manage your work items, remember that Azure DevOps tracks lead time and cycle time. Lead time starts when an item is added to the system, while cycle time begins when work is actively in progress.

5. **Visualising Your Workflow**: Set up your columns to reflect your workflow stages—inventory, backlog, discovery, development, validation, and done. This visual representation helps the team understand where each item stands in the process.

6. **Configuring Columns and Swim Lanes**: You can configure your columns to include specific states and set work-in-progress (WIP) limits. Additionally, if you have different classes of service, consider adding swim lanes to differentiate between them.

### Customising Cards and Fields

Azure DevOps allows you to customise the information displayed on your cards. You can add fields, style rules, and annotations to ensure that the most relevant information is easily accessible. However, be cautious not to overcrowd your cards with too much information, as this can hinder clarity.

### Conclusion

Implementing a Caman strategy using Azure DevOps can significantly enhance your team's ability to visualise and manage work effectively. By establishing shared rules, customising your board, and understanding the flow of work, you can create a more efficient and transparent workflow.
