00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,960
creating an effective caman strategy is

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,599
hard in this world of hybrid work we

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,360
need to share our visualizations using

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,280
digital tools one such tool is as your

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,840
devops here I'll discuss how you can use

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,250
as your devops to visualize your work as

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,309
part of a camand

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,309

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,160
strategy hi I'm Martin hinwood owner and

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,040
principal consultant at naked agility

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,840
I'm a professional scrum trainer with

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,040
scrum.org a professional pamban trainer

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,320
with Pro caman and I've been a Microsoft

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
MVP in GitHub and aure devops for 15

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,120
[Music]

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,120
years before we start it's essential to

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
understand why we need to use something

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,160
like Azure boards in order to manage our

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,640
work since the pandemic many teams have

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,920
moved away from physical offices and

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,799
even when we're in a physical office

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,479
we're not all there at the same time

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,920
this means that there's no physical wall

24
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:13,320
or meeting room that teams can use that

25
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,240
they can present all of their work

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,200
visually um where they can all see it

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
digital tools for saving and presenting

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,119
that work have really become more

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
critical than

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,560
ever now there is way more to a cband

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,439
strategy than just a tool a cand

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,640
strategy works best when applied to a

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,280
stable system one where we're all

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,920
following the same rules however most of

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,880
us don't work in environments like that

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,600
each participant in the system typically

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,000
makes choices based on their own

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,320
internal system one that they don't

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,280
necessarily share with the rest of the

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,399
team well why don't we share it I think

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
it's a result of not realizing how

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,960
important it is that we do share it we

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,439
don't realize how much

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,560
impact those seemingly small choices

45
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,039
make

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,759
like which item to pull or not and why

47
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,119
have on the entire system we've created

48
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:13,160
a lot of local

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,239
optimizations for for our overall system

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,239
that may have a negative impact on that

51
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,519
larger

52
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,560
system so what do we do about it well I

53
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,239
I recommend that you sit down with all

54
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,040
of the participants that are going to be

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,319
working on the work that goes through

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,160
your system um and have them work out

57
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,160
what rules they want to use are come to

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,360
an agreement on the choices that they're

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,920
going to make it doesn't need to be

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,120
perfect you'll have ample opportunity to

61
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,440
change and adapt those rules as you

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,680
discover the impact that it has in the

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,040
work but we need a place to get

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,400
started and really you you don't have to

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,800
do all of that before you start with

66
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
caman you can get started and then work

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,800
through those those those problems with

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,360
a rougher workflow um like just guess

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,040
whatever it is you work on just now more

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,400
uh uh details you can add later to start

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,480
stabilizing that system and and make it

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,200
more effective but but let's leave that

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,720
for

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,959
now for now we're going to look at how

75
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,959
we can create a camand board for a

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,360
typical software team and then how we

77
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319
can Implement that in asure

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,640
devops I'm going to show you how to

79
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,480
manage at the cards on the board how to

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,080
customize the cards so that you can see

81
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,799
what's going on and also how to

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,519
customize uh The Columns and perhaps

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,120
swim Lanes if you have the need for that

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,439
um and then be able to see and visualize

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,640
what's going on on your board and filter

86
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
that board for the things you might need

87
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,159
so let's take a look um at what's going

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,760
on in your devops so I have an

89
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,840
environment um here this is just my

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,959
environment I have a a lovely org over

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
here on the left that's my uh learning

92
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:06,519
environment and I have a few projects

93
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,920
that I've preset up uh with things that

94
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,640
we can look at so let's look at a

95
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,400
finished uh uh environment first or at

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,920
least the first stage like we've set up

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,440
um our boards to be able to see what's

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,000
going on I'm going to click on demo

99
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,160
environment so on the left hand side

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,080
you'll see boards and you'll see two

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,639
things that are important you'll see uh

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,759
under boards you'll have boards and

103
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,160
backlog um those are the two main things

104
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,360
that I would expect both cban and scrum

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,000
teams um to use when they're kind of

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,520
managing their work so I'm going to

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,639
click on boards

108
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,199
first and here you'll see I have a preet

109
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,199
up uh board for this team so in this

110
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,080
view uh you can see that I've got a

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
number of different columns going on

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,160
here uh but the important thing to

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,400
realize is that the states of the work

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,440
items the underlying work item States

115
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,880
have have not been changed here when

116
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,360
we've customized The Columns this means

117
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,800
that multiple teams working inside of

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,360
the same aure devops project can have a

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,199
different set of columns while

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,400
maintaining the same States let's take a

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,440
look at some of the work item States and

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,919
how it applies to cand depending on the

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,440
process that you've

124
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:29,199
selected uh so here you can um see an

125
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,199
overlay with two things going on so I'll

126
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,880
horiz onally uh you can see the states

127
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,080
for the particular process that you

128
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,960
might have selected so if your process

129
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,759
for your work is based on the agile

130
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,759
process on the scrum process or the cmmi

131
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,600
process it'll have these different um

132
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,840
States uh that you see here so I prefer

133
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,360
the scrum process uh cuz I believe it's

134
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,479
the most generic although I do make some

135
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,039
changes to it uh so here's the scrum

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,440
process here we go from new to approved

137
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,759
to committed to done in the adual

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,600
process process which is the other most

139
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,000
common one uh people go from new uh to

140
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,199
active active to resolved resolved to

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,599
closed uh but the vertical columns here

142
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,120
where you have proposed in progress and

143
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,199
resolved and completed give you an

144
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,680
indication of how those states are going

145
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,280
to be treated by Azure devops under the

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,160
covers Azure devops has a whole bunch of

147
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,520
agile planning tools that have been

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,960
applied to the to the system that been

149
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,479
created um and the fundamental BAS basis

150
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,479
upon which they work is that uh you have

151
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,120
a proposed state so that's things that

152
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,280
we're not working on yet um so when

153
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,680
things get added to the system you'll

154
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,880
see that the lead time timer starts um

155
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,199
but the cycle time timer doesn't so

156
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,639
inside of azure devops they specify

157
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,280
cycle time as from when the developers

158
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,879
start the work to when it's finished and

159
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,000
lead time to when it's added to the

160
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,639
system to when it's finished you can

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,120
absolutely argue the validity of that um

162
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,160
I would maybe prepare prefer a more

163
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,599
configurable option but this is how it's

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,360
configured currently inside of aure

165
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,039
devops so if Uh something's in the

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,919
proposed state the lead time timer

167
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,400
started with the cycle times timers not

168
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,240
so in the agile template you only have

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,520
one state which is new which is in

170
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,560
proposed um and then you have active and

171
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,240
resolved which are in progress States

172
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,599
and then you have one completed State

173
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,360
called closed um and that's where both

174
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,800
the timers stop okay so when it crosses

175
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,560
this line it gets marked as uh um active

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,120
or

177
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,639
resolved sorry when it crosses this line

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,440
the cycle time gets uh timer gets

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,280
started so in in this case one of the

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,599
reasons I prefer the scrum uh process

181
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,800
here is that by default although you can

182
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,120
absolutely add it to the adile agile

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,240
template um by default it has two states

184
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,639
in proposed we you got new it's been

185
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,800
added to the system it might have been

186
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,879
added by some random person in your

187
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,319
organization so you don't necessarily

188
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:13,039
want to have started the work and I

189
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,879
usually use approved or some kind of

190
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:23,520
second state to indicate that the person

191
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:25,319
who um manages that backlog who is or

192
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
this could be the team

193
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,159
themselves the the team has agreed that

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,800
they're probably going to do it

195
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,440
right so that's where it's approved

196
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,839
we're going to going to work on it

197
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,279
that's why I would kind of like lead

198
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,159
time to start there but that's you can't

199
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,560
have

200
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,080
everything uh and then in progress I

201
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,800
actually prefer just one state um I

202
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,200
usually change it from commited to

203
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,920
something else like forecasted or just

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
in progress right new approved in

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,279
progress done

206
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,040
um but I prefer one state so that the

207
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,519
developers get the choice to split into

208
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,880
however many columns that they want um

209
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,680
having an active and forced resolved

210
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
State um can limit the way you can

211
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,880
configure the board but also you can

212
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,839
work it into the way you do things for

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,320
sure and then everything has a has a

214
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,519
default closed state so that's the the

215
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,800
the kind of flow of work from Azure

216
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,880
devops internals

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,959
perspective uh but we can configure that

218
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,360
however we like on the board so you can

219
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,240
kind of see here I'm going to try and uh

220
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,720
show you what this it looks like so on

221
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,000
this board you'll notice that I have uh

222
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,720
inventory I have backlog and I have

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,160
Discovery and when you look at the work

224
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,839
items they are new in all of those

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,519
columns okay so that they've not yet

226
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,560
this is the scrum template not the scrum

227
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,720
templ the agile template so you'll

228
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,720
notice that the the the the items

229
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,480
haven't been moved to a different state

230
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,920
and then in development we have

231
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,880
active and then in validation we have

232
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,880
resolved and in done we have closed okay

233
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
so this means

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:26,720
that when work crosses this line

235
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,040
here that's when the timer starts uh on

236
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,360
the uh lead time but it has to to cross

237
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,839
this line here in this particular

238
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,000
process to start the timer for cycle

239
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,839
time and all the timers stop at uh this

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,160
line here okay

241
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,600
um so that allows us to do a b Implement

242
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,079
a bunch of controls that we can use to

243
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,000
kind of see what's going on and manage

244
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,399
our work so this particular team has set

245
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,880
up we've got our inventory this is stuff

246
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,399
that's been added to the backlog that we

247
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,680
may or may not do yet so that's like the

248
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,560
The Back warehouse in our shop um and

249
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,120
then we've got a backlog which is the

250
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,440
stuff that we're going to try and sell

251
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,440
we're going to do has been moved to the

252
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,880
front and it's moved into that column so

253
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,839
inventory is just a big list of stuff um

254
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,160
and then when we decide we're going to

255
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,120
going to do something we've agreed to do

256
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,480
it um whatever those reasons are it ends

257
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,519
up in the backlog um and things in the

258
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,360
backlog are then options to be pulled

259
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,959
into Discovery so you could call this

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
options right uh

261
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,880
um so I'm going to pull things the

262
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,519
team's going to pull things from here

263
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,160
into into Discovery so they can put it

264
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,279
anywhere they like in Discovery so let

265
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,560
me drag and drop that in there once it's

266
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,279
in Discovery that column will change to

267
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
Discovery but you'll note that the state

268
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,079
has not changed I'll show you how that

269
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,560
works in a moment so once that that is

270
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,440
in this doing column Discovery doing

271
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,880
that's when we're going the team's going

272
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,600
to do all of that Discovery or

273
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,279
refinement work that they need to do to

274
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,959
figure out what this thing is before

275
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,800
they actually start it right before they

276
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,320
actually start executing on creating

277
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,360
this and things may drop out of this

278
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,519
space right because we might do some

279
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,199
analysis on this and figure out that

280
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,199
it's not something we want to do it's

281
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,920
either too costly um or or whatever

282
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,680
reason um here we've got generating

283
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,120
invoice reports that has been blocked

284
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,360
perhaps it's been blocked because we're

285
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,320
waiting for new information we we've got

286
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,120
a request out to somebody else but it

287
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
currently is blocked

288
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,680
but we've split this column into doing

289
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,000
and done so the doing column and the

290
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,199
weight State column we've done the work

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,240
and it's waiting for the next column to

292
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:45,360
pull it in when it crosses this line

293
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,240
here from Discovery to development

294
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
that's when this item is going to change

295
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,800
state so if I bring this across you'll

296
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
notice it's h currently set to new and

297
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,519
now it's going to be marked as active

298
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,399
cuz we've crossed that line um for the

299
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,399
for the internals of of of azure devops

300
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,120
from one state to another state even

301
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,800
though we've get multiple columns I'll

302
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,120
show how that's configured

303
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,880
soon so we've got that that development

304
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
uh column now so this is the the team's

305
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,160
going to work on it uh we're going to

306
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,519
work on it and at some point we're going

307
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,720
to mark it as done so it's now moved to

308
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:25,040
the next column um so again we've not

309
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,959
changed the state it's still active so

310
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,920
if you're creating reports across

311
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,160
multiple teams inside of the same

312
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
project you can still report on those

313
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,760
States you don't need to worry about the

314
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
columns right there's ways you can do

315
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,079
that too but um you don't need to worry

316
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,120
about the

317
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,880
columns so now um it's development done

318
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,639
it's waiting for whoever does validation

319
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,920
to pick it up uh this could be um last

320
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:57,279
minute checks by the the the developers

321
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,120
who want to um check that everything is

322
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,079
all the all the eyes are dotted in the

323
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,560
teas are crossed before they say

324
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,279
officially say it's done they're going

325
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,120
to check the work against the definition

326
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,360
of done against anything else they

327
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,759
believe they need to do

328
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,120
um whatever it is they need to do in

329
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,639
that that particular stage and then that

330
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,560
item when it moves across this line here

331
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,240
is going to move from active to resolved

332
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,480
um and you'll notice I've hit the whip

333
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,959
limit gone beyond it but just for demo

334
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,880
purposes I'm okay with that um and then

335
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,360
they're going to validate that it's in

336
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,639
the resolve state We believe We as the

337
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,320
team believe the work has been done um

338
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
we're marking it as resolved we're going

339
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,199
to come back around do a sanity check on

340
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,519
that um and then move it into closed to

341
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,800
say it's been finished um and there you

342
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,839
go we had a piece of work flow from left

343
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,480
to right through our system um hopefully

344
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,600
as effective as

345
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,440
possible now this team um is generally

346
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,240
hopefully uh when they're working um on

347
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,959
their their checks when they're viewing

348
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
this board is going to walk the board

349
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,399
from right right to left uh ensuring

350
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,600
that they've populated the board that

351
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,560
they've got it all uh set up they can do

352
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,680
those things here um and you can see

353
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,680
I've got the blocked visualization there

354
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,880
uh uh highlighted to see see what's

355
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,880
going

356
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,240
on so how might you configure uh uh

357
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,519
configure this there's a number of

358
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,440
things that you're you're going to want

359
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,800
to configure uh to be able to set this

360
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,360
up uh so I'm going to show you how to

361
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,120
set up and manage The Columns and Lanes

362
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,040
if you do want Lanes um so if I click

363
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,800
configure board settings over here on

364
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,959
the top right um you'll see that uh in

365
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,240
here um I have a configuration for uh

366
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,480
Fields where I have bug and user story

367
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,519
so if I click on user story uh you'll

368
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,240
see that um it's showing What fields are

369
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,160
available for user story so I've added

370
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,639
iteration path I think I didn't un buug

371
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,920
so I can easily just add iteration path

372
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:05,680
on here and it will show up on the bug

373
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
items as well so if I save that you'll

374
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,639
see that bug item change to include the

375
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,639
iteration State as well there's

376
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,839
iteration path there coming

377
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,440
in um so I can add additional Fields if

378
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,639
I have custom fields or something I want

379
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,319
to show on there it's definitely worth

380
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
considering that the more Fields you add

381
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,160
the bigger the cards going to be the

382
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
less you're going to be able to show on

383
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,959
the screen so just consider that um and

384
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,560
have only the most important information

385
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,240
surfaced here

386
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,160
uh you can add style rules style rules

387
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:40,279
enable you to change the look and feel

388
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,880
of the work items so um you might add if

389
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,720
I do a a test rule whatever it's called

390
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,240
and then I can change either the color

391
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,000
of the card or the color of the title of

392
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,120
the card uh so if I change the

393
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,720
background color of the card let's say

394
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,240
I'm going to change it to a kind of

395
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:03,240
light blue um only if the changed date

396
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:07,240
let's do change date

397
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,720
is greater than let's say today minus

398
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,880
one okay so if I save that if I've got

399
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,360
my uh there we go so these items that

400
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,360
I've moved today um are going to show up

401
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,039
uh today or yesterday today minus one

402
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,880
are going to show up as these things

403
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,400
have moved everything else has been

404
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,600
static and hasn't moved so I can uh

405
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,760
prove that just by bringing this one

406
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,400
across Ross and you'll notice it changes

407
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,039
color immediately because it's been

408
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,559
changed recently so you can use that to

409
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,480
highlight things that have H moved

410
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,240
recently or

411
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,200
not um I can also not only can I do uh

412
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,039
um styles on the cards you can have

413
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,160
multiple Styles if you want um again a

414
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,960
kaleidoscope of color um removes the

415
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,159
importance of color right so uh try and

416
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,679
be careful with that um and here you can

417
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,799
see I've got a a tag uh blocked tag tag

418
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,200
um that highlights a particular color so

419
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,960
in this case block tag highlighting red

420
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,679
um you can add other tags as well

421
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,200
depending on what it is you want to want

422
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,039
to look at

423
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,840
too um on these cards you can have

424
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:20,159
annotations so if the sub item of this

425
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,120
is tasks uh or things uh linked to to to

426
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,760
GitHub or tests you can have them

427
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,919
actually show up on the cards and you

428
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,440
can click on it and it will drop down uh

429
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,159
I don't have any of those set up just

430
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,360
now just for that that VI uh but then we

431
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,159
get to customizing the The Columns

432
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,440
themselves on the board so if I click on

433
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:41,159
columns you'll see that I have a the the

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,000
same columns that I had um set up before

435
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:48,559
the first one inventory has to be in the

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,240
new and the last one done has to be in

437
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,840
that closed cuz those are the start and

438
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,240
end States for the work items right so

439
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,840
that you must have at least one uh start

440
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,600
State and at least one end state

441
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,200
everything else in the middle uh you can

442
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,840
configure so for example I added backlog

443
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,320
um but kept it in new and I set the whip

444
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,840
limit to 15 so you can see that's 11 out

445
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,799
of 15 is in the backlog at the moment

446
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,840
and I can also choose to split the

447
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,320
column between it doing and done um and

448
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,679
then there's a I I don't really like the

449
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,120
name of this this is the the definition

450
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:29,600
of workflow uh field so let's say in

451
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,960
order for things to move move from

452
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,360
backlog into Discovery um there might

453
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,640
there's some things that need to be true

454
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,520
so I could create some

455
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,720
markdown uh uh that says

456
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,720
um

457
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:52,240
uh inventory to

458
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:59,840
backlog I'm going to do that inventory

459
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:01,760
to backlog um rule one right rule two

460
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,960
and then on the next one I'm actually

461
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,679
just going to copy that so that I can be

462
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:12,360
quick and call that

463
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,840
uh backlog to Discovery and what are the

464
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,559
rules that are going to be applied and

465
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,320
if I save that now you'll see at the top

466
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:24,880
the backlog has a little uh

467
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,799
um IE if you hover over it it will show

468
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,799
you that markdown information there so

469
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,960
you can add some of your definition to

470
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,799
workflow you can add links in here as

471
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,520
well so I guess it might link out to

472
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,799
your wiki page um or wherever you've got

473
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,080
additional information for these uh uh

474
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,280
for these rules for your definition of

475
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
workflow you could even store the whole

476
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,280
thing out there and just and just link

477
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,480
it so you can go and click those

478
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,240
items so that's that's uh quite useful

479
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,480
in the columns um as you go through you

480
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,159
can see discovery which is a split

481
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,000
column here doing and done all I need

482
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:58,760
you to do is take the box again you've

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,679
got whip limit you've got what what

484
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,240
state it's in this one is new

485
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,400
development is where we switch to active

486
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,080
again it's split and validation is set

487
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,120
to resolved and done is set closed so

488
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,600
those are really those those column

489
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:17,080
configurations it's not as um there's

490
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,240
not as many configurations as I I I I

491
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,559
might like in the long run uh but it

492
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,480
does give me that ability to to have

493
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,520
those visual boards and have work flow

494
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,400
from left to right across those boards

495
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,039
in a way that allows me to create those

496
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,039
those those visualizations that I'm

497
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,559
looking for uh you can add swim Lanes so

498
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,840
if you had um

499
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,159
different classes of service uh for work

500
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,400
flowing across this board then you could

501
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:48,080
create uh different lanes for this it's

502
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,799
not something I normally would do uh but

503
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,159
let's call this uh

504
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,200
uh expedite and we're going to make it

505
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,080
neon red cuz expedite is really

506
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,840
important but the default

507
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,960
is not going to be expedite if I create

508
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,679
that H you'll see I'll have this

509
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,919
expedite Lane going across the top and I

510
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,679
could pull a piece of work in uh and

511
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,480
move it along and it just counts to the

512
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:15,760
usual uh uh whip that I don't think

513
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,279
there's a whip you can add for the

514
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,039
expedite Lane is there a where can

515
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,679
I maybe I can set some

516
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,159
rules

517
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,039
um for things that have to be in the

518
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,080
exped D Lane versus in the default Lane

519
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,200
which can't have

520
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:38,279
rules I don't know need to explore what

521
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,120
criteria does there um it's not

522
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,360
something that I've actually used so

523
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,760
there we go you can see I've been able

524
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,679
to configure the board I've been able to

525
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,960
uh set up an expedite Lane I've been

526
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,360
able to set up my columns um and I've

527
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,919
now got a configured uh um caman board

528
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,240
uh there are some additional things that

529
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,799
you might want to want to do for example

530
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,360
if I switched to

531
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,679
backlog um I've added um some additional

532
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,760
columns here to the backlog so as well

533
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,480
as having State I've also added board

534
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,640
column uh and board column done um so

535
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
you can see a little bit more about

536
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,279
what's going on on the other board so if

537
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,400
you're the product owner or you're the

538
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:25,120
team lead or whatever people the whole

539
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,679
team right looking at the order of the

540
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,190
backlog um you're able to manage it uh

541
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,480
from there pretty

542
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,600
[Music]

543
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,279
effectively if you're struggling to

544
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,320
understand your systems or how work

545
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,039
flows through these systems the naked

546
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,640
