The audience (likely practitioners or leaders in agile, DevOps, or management) partially aligns, but the main purpose is to foster holistic, integrated governance—not customer-centric delivery or measurement. Signal-to-noise ratio is moderate, as the content is on-topic for governance optimisation but off-topic for customer focus.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This resource articulates the dangers of optimising for isolated governance outcomes and emphasizes system-wide thinking, but it doesn't address customer value, feedback, or outcomes. Its intent and focus are internal, so confidence for 'Customer Focus' classification is low.",

The emphasis is on best practices and integrated thinking, not immutable truths. The target audience aligns well and the discussion is relevant, but it lacks explicit depth on first principles; thus, confidence is modest.",

While it touches on workflow integration and transparency, it does not explicitly discuss the Definition of Workflow as articulated in Kanban or related agile frameworks. There are no direct mentions of workflow definitions, WIP limits, policies governing flow, or distinctions between Kanban and Scrum practices. No penalties applied, as the tone and references are neither outdated nor oppositional.",
