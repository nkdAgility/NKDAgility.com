So, a really silly example is, let's say you have a cog in a machine and you're looking just at this cog. It's slow to turn because it's pushing against all these other cogs in the system. What would make this the most efficient cog possible? Well, if we delete all the teeth from the cog, then it can just spin freely. But now it no longer drives the rest of the system; it's no longer part of the rest of the system. Right? We've made a local optimisation that makes this better, but it doesn't help us overall. And that's what often happens when governance is a separate department.
