1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,599
so I a really silly example is let's say

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:10,679
you have a a cog in a

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,920
machine and you're looking just at this

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,520
Cog and it's slow to turn because it's

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,600
pushing against all these other cogs in

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,680
the system um what would make this the

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,119
most efficient Cog possible well if we

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
delete all the teeth from the Cog then

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,199
it can just spin

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,880
freely but now it no longer drives the

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,559
rest of the system is no longer part of

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,840
the rest of the system right we've made

13
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,600
a local optimization that that makes

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
this better but it doesn't doesn't help

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,320
us overall and that that's what often

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,840
happens when governance is a separate

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,840
Department
