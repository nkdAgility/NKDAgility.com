  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Have you ever felt something was off with burndown charts? I know I have. There's always been this nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right. Over the years, people have revered these charts as the ultimate tool for monitoring a team‚Äôs progress. But I‚Äôve come to realize that this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-burndown-charts-the-false-holy-grail\">Burndown Charts: The False Holy Grail</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let‚Äôs start by addressing the elephant in the room: burndown charts are often seen as the <em>holy grail</em> of monitoring a team. But when you dig deeper, you realize they‚Äôre built on assumptions that just don‚Äôt align with the way Agile teams work.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-myth-of-fixed-scope-and-just-in-time-planning\">The Myth of Fixed Scope and Just-in-Time Planning</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Burndown charts operate under the assumption that the scope of work is fixed at the start of a sprint. The idea is that you can‚Äôt change the scope once the sprint begins, or if you do, you need to replace a task with one of equal size.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>üí° <strong>Let‚Äôs get real:</strong> This mindset is rooted in traditional project management thinking. You know, the ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù approach to scope control. But Agile doesn‚Äôt work that way.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Agile embraces <em>just-in-time planning</em>. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to the product backlog; it extends to the sprint backlog too. The notion that you can lock in all the work at the start of a sprint is a fallacy. The real world doesn‚Äôt work like that.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-problem-with-upfront-task-planning\">The Problem with Upfront Task Planning</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the biggest issues I have with burndown charts is the reliance on upfront task planning. Some teams even go as far as to burn down <em>hours on tasks</em>. To me, that‚Äôs the worst way to do it. Let me explain why.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At the start of the sprint, teams often try to plan out every task, along with the hours it will take to complete each one. But here‚Äôs the problem:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>We <strong>discover</strong> more by <em>doing</em> than by thinking upfront.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>No one can accurately predict all the tasks and the hours they will take before they begin.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Even if you think you‚Äôre getting 90% of the way there, it‚Äôs still wrong.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>üí¨ <strong>My advice?</strong> Forget about trying to plan everything upfront. I‚Äôm not just saying that 90% is wrong‚Äî50% is probably wrong too. The reality is that we often don‚Äôt know what it will take to complete a task until we‚Äôre already knee-deep in it.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-managing-work-empirically\">Managing Work Empirically</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Agile is founded on empiricism. That means we learn by doing and adapt as we go. In an empirical process, you‚Äôre not going to know exactly what it will take to complete a piece of work before you start. That‚Äôs why burndown charts, which are designed to predict the trajectory of work completion, are fundamentally flawed.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let‚Äôs consider an alternative: Instead of trying to predict everything upfront, manage the work empirically. Adjust and adapt as you discover new information during the sprint.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-burndown-in-story-points-or-stories\">Burndown in Story Points or Stories</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now, some teams attempt to improve burndowns by burning down <em>story points</em> instead of hours. Others take it even further and burn down <em>stories</em>. This approach is slightly better because it‚Äôs less granular. But even then, it‚Äôs not perfect.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>‚úÖ <strong>Here‚Äôs a better way:</strong> Instead of focusing on burning down tasks or stories, focus on the flow of value through your system. A steady, consistent flow of value is far more important than meeting some arbitrary goal on a graph.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>If you're halfway through the sprint and you've delivered 50% of the value, things are going well.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>If you're halfway through and have only delivered 30%, then it's time to reassess.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But remember, these measurements are still based on the assumption that the tasks were properly scoped upfront‚Äîwhich, as we‚Äôve discussed, is rarely the case.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-agile-teams-need-flexibility-not-fixed-plans\">Agile Teams Need Flexibility, Not Fixed Plans</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The teams that excel in Agile are the ones that embrace adaptability.

      Burndown charts hinder Agile adaptability, focus on value flow instead of
      rigid plans, and embrace flexibility for better team success.
