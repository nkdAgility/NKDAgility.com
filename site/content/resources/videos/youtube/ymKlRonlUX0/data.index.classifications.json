However, it does not explicitly reference accountability, outcome ownership, or how clearly defined accountabilities shape behaviors or value delivery. While it tangentially relates to how work is tracked and managed (which could influence clarity of roles), it never addresses structural accountability, specific role accountabilities (e.g., Product Owner, Scrum Master), or distinctions between accountability and responsibility. The main ideas stay focused on planning artifacts and adaptability, not on who owns outcomes or how organizational effectiveness is rooted in accountability design. Some indirect hints at systemic improvement exist, but the discussion lacks explicit, sustained alignment or depth on the core category.",
