1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,240
Another ghost of Agile
past is burndown charts.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,050
You know, I always, always had
a problem with burndown charts.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,290
There was just something niggling at me
that there was something wrong with them.

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,470
Everybody seemed to talk
like they were the holy grail

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,230
of monitoring a team.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,560
But when you start thinking

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,200
about just-in-time planning,

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,540
Just-in-time planning doesn't just extend
to the product backlog,

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,000
it also extends to the sprint backlog.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,240
And if we do just-in-time planning,
how could you possibly have a burndown

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,800
that reflects the team,
the work that the team's working on.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,760
Think about it. The way a
burndown works is it goes

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,290
from top left to bottom right.

14
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,900
It goes from a list of all the stuff
that we need to deliver burns down

15
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,000
towards that trajectory

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,250
of we've delivered all the stuff in it.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,080
In order to do that we have
to understand all the stuff

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,890
that's going to come
into the sprint backlog at the start.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,980
This is why you see lots
of teams and organizations fixated

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,160
on that once you've brought things
into the sprint backlog

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,760
you can't change the scope.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,160
Crap, right?

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,800
The idea that you can't, that
if you're going to remove something

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,720
from the sprint backlog
you have to bring in something

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,090
of equal size

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,020
and all of that stuff
that is really really just smacks

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,880
of traditional project
thinking right we've

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,790
got scope we want to maintain
that scope we want to control that scope

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,400
so we're gonna have this burndown
that we want to be on this line of that

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,510
and it's just just a crap.

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,710
The worst way to do burndowns is
if you are burning down hours on tasks.

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,580
That's probably the worst form
Because it implies that we've built all

33
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,640
of the tasks with all of the hours
at the beginning of the sprint.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,980
And I don't mean all, right?
There's at least one person

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,080
out there is sitting there thinking,
but Martin, we don't plan all

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,260
of this stuff, but maybe we
get 90% of the way there.

37
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm saying 90% is crap.
I'm saying 70% is crap.

38
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm saying 50% is probably
crap, right?

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
We discover more by doing

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,020
than we could by thinking up front.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,750
That's the fundamental
context within which Agile sits.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,390
And anybody that thinks
that they can build products

43
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,040
that don't exist yet

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,420
and have a higher than 50% probability
of the things you bring

45
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,040
in being the things you need is,
I don't know what they're smoking

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,320
but it would be great
to get some of that stuff.

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,330
Because it's just not how the
world works. How the world works.

48
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,850
When we have that high
degree of probability

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,380
that things will be different,
low predictability

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,540
in what we think's gonna happen
and what actually happens,

51
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,860
we need a different
way to manage the work.

52
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,110
We need to manage the work empirically

53
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,520
and in any empirical process
which Scrum is founded on empiricism, most

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,540
of Agile is founded upon empiricism,
in any empirical process you're not going

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,790
to know what it's going
to take to do something.

56
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,280
That's the first part.
So if we're thinking

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,440
we can create a whole big list
of hours at the start and then burn down

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,410
and see that we're on that trajectory,

59
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,140
that's not gonna happen.

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,400
So a solution for that
that many teams have tried or many teams

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,460
that I've seen have tried
is to do burn down

62
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,720
in story points so instead
of burning down the hours they burn

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,090
down the story points
so it's slightly less granular

64
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,720
or go even more less granular
and burn down in stories right so you get

65
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,040
that more jagged line rather
than a smooth line but the real and

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,260
that's a little bit better at least
if we're 50% way through the sprint

67
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,350
and we're 50% delivered value
that's probably the best

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,730
that the burndown is going to
get right in in that world where

69
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,290
we've brought 10 things into the sprint
and we're gonna deliver 10 things

70
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,520
if we're halfway through the sprint
and we've delivered five

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,080
of them things are going good
if we're halfway through the sprint

72
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,560
and we've delivered three
of them, things are not going good,

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,130
right?

74
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,110
That's probably, there's a
lot of assumptions in there

75
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,980
that things are of similar size,
there's all kinds of assumptions in there,

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,000
but that's probably the best
of that world.

77
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,430
But the reality is that all
of those are predicated on the idea

78
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,160
that you've decided what
that thing is up front.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,480
You've decided how many
of those things you're going

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,860
to bring in up front.

81
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,630
And whether it's hours
or story points or stories,

82
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,580
that's not how it works.

83
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,570
Most teams have a higher
degree of volatility.

84
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,640
They're not just thinking about the value
that they're delivering in the sprint,

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,840
their sprint goal.
They're also thinking

86
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,480
about how much technical debt
do we have to pay off?

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,080
How much refactoring
do we maybe have to do

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,620
as we're building this product.

89
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,450
They're thinking about that,
those little bugs that keep,

90
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,120
you know, that steady stream
of small, inconsequential

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
but valuable defects
that keep coming through the system

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,390
you don't want them building
up so you've got to take some of them on

93
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,400
and responding to the business
and the business needs something

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,410
and be able to respond to it
or production issues

95
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:51,550
or there's too many ors the reality
is you are much better focusing

96
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,850
on the flow of value
through your system and maintaining

97
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,360
a steady consistent flow as much
as you can within the bounds of the work

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,810
that you're doing, than
on trying to meet some arbitrary

99
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,320
top left to bottom right graph, burn down.

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,820
That's just ridiculous,
and it is one of the ghosts of Agile past.

101
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,060
If you are being haunted
by these ghosts of agile past,

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,960
we can help you exercise them
or find a coach, consultant,

103
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,380
or trainer who can.

104
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,640
Don't let these phantoms undermine
the effectiveness of your value delivery.

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,780
The longer they linger,
the more they'll haunt

106
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,270
your team's progress.

107
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,400
Send me an email to martin
