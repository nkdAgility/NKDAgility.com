As I sit down to write this, I’m reminded of the ever-evolving landscape of work and how we, as agile practitioners, must adapt to the changes around us. Tonight, I’ll be hosting a meetup in collaboration with the British Computer Society, where I’ll delve into the intriguing topic of "Scaling Dragons." This isn’t just a whimsical title; it encapsulates the dual nature of scaling agility—what can propel us forward and what could potentially derail our efforts.

### Scaling Agility: The Good and the Bad

In my experience, scaling agility is not merely about expanding frameworks like Scrum or Nexus; it’s about understanding the practices that truly matter for large-scale teams. Here’s what I plan to cover:

- **Scrum Fundamentals**: I’ll start with the core principles of Scrum, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. It’s essential to revisit these fundamentals, especially when scaling.
  
- **Diving into Nexus**: We’ll explore Nexus, but from a practical standpoint. What are the key practices that can make or break a large-scale Scrum team? 

- **Metrics that Matter**: Metrics can be a double-edged sword. I’ll share some starter metrics that may not be perfect for every organisation but can serve as a springboard for developing your own tailored metrics.

### Join Us Live

If you’re interested in joining this interactive session, it kicks off at 7 p.m. GMT. We’ll be streaming live on YouTube, LinkedIn, and Facebook, so there’s no excuse not to participate! However, I encourage you to join the Meetup for a more engaging experience with fellow attendees.

### Adapting to Virtual Training

With the current climate, in-person events have taken a back seat. I’ve been working diligently to transition my training classes to a virtual format. This is no small feat, as my classes are designed for high engagement and interaction. Here’s what I’m considering:

- **Two-Day Events**: I’m looking at running my Professional Scrum Master and Professional Scrum with User Experience classes as two-day events. This format allows for deeper dives into the material while maintaining engagement.

- **Virtual Tools**: I’ve been experimenting with various technologies to ensure that our virtual classes are as effective as possible. For instance, I’m exploring Tabletopia for running the Get Kanban game, which is a fantastic way to simulate real-world scenarios in a virtual environment.

- **Collaborative Learning**: I’m collaborating with colleagues to deliver classes in both English and Spanish, ensuring that we reach a broader audience and cater to diverse learning needs.

### A Call to Connect

I’m always open to discussions about agility and DevOps. If you have questions or need guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m more than happy to have a chat—no strings attached. Whether it’s a quick call or a more in-depth session, let’s make the most of this time we have.

### Reflecting on Global Experiences

As I reflect on my journey, I’m grateful for the opportunities I’ve had to train in various countries, from Saudi Arabia to Ghana and Azerbaijan. Each experience has enriched my understanding of agility and the unique challenges different cultures face. 

In closing, I look forward to experimenting, inspecting, and adapting our approaches to training and collaboration in this new virtual world. Join me tonight at the Future of Work meetup, and let’s explore the scaling dragons together! 

Feel free to follow me on Twitter for updates and insights. I’m eager to hear from you and discuss how we can navigate this evolving landscape together.
