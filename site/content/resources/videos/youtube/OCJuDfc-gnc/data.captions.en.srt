1
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:21,390
okay this is Martin ho8

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:25,080
from Naked agility I come a few things

3
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,699
that I wanted to mention tonight I'm

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,279
going to be doing meetup for the future

5
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,510
of work in conjunction with the British

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,309
Computer Society at 7 p.m. UK time

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,510
tonight

8
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:47,690
I'm going to be talking about scaling

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:52,350
dragons the the things that are going to

10
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:55,500
be beneficial or destroyers as we move

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:00,210
towards scaling agility and things that

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,699
we need to consider and figure out so I

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,610
think that will be good fun we're going

14
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,610
to be I'm going to be talking about I'm

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,610
going to be talking about scrum

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:16,100
initially and then I'm going to be

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:20,040
diving a little bit into Nexus but more

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,009
from the perspective of the practices

19
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,229
that really matter for a large-scale

20
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,049
scrum team talk about them for a little

21
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,290
bit and then maybe we'll touch a little

22
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,659
bit on metrics and getting an

23
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:40,130
understanding of some of the key at

24
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,090
least starter metrics you might not be

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,570
the metrics I'm going to talk about

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,780
might not be valid for your organization

27
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:53,189
but you can use them as a starter point

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,320
as hints as a lead through towards

29
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,460
understanding metrics that might be

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,710
viable for your organization that's so

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:08,879
that's scaling dragons tonight at 7 p.m.

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:11,910
gmt with the future of work meetup in

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,920
conjunction with the British Computer

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,000
Society

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,709
it's also going to stream live on

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,330
YouTube LinkedIn and Facebook so if you

37
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,030
can't get into those events you can

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,770
certainly get into get into that but

39
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,010
ultimately if you want to be in an

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:36,569
interactive session then definitely head

41
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:39,650
over to the Meetup and join in the folks

42
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,180
that are organizing the meet are awesome

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,640
and we're gonna have a good fun

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,900
again that's future of work in

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,030
conjunction with British Computer

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,430
Society at 7:00 p.m. tonight I also

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,330
wanted to mention that I'm working

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,330
obviously there's no in-person events

49
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,420
going on so any time that I've got a

50
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,280
conference event we're going to be doing

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,519
it online if the conference event is

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,780
cancelled

53
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:16,799
then I will record or do a live event

54
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,609
anyway at the same time or separately

55
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,630
off of that talk and so that people can

56
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:28,850
join in and I'm also going to be moving

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,010
some of my training classes to be live

58
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,519
virtual classes this is a very

59
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,489
complicated thing all of the scrum the

60
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,549
dark classes that I teach are really

61
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:46,230
designed to be high bandwidth impersonal

62
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:49,019
classes so what I want to do is for the

63
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,310
classes that make sense we're going to

64
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:57,079
run some virtual classes we'll probably

65
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:04,290
run them as kind of like a 2-day event

66
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:06,269
and see what makes sense whether it

67
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,549
makes sense to continue to run it as a

68
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:13,829
two-day event or to balance that with

69
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:17,370
like a you know dude over 40 is four

70
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:19,950
half days or do two full days what what

71
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,470
makes sense for for that training so

72
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,430
I've been looking at the the

73
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,160
professional scrum master and the

74
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,080
professional scrum with you

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,140
acts are ones that I think I'm going to

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,270
run first in the next couple of weeks I

77
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,270
have classes scheduled in Edinburgh for

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,620
that so I want to convert them to live

79
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,790
events it's going to be really

80
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,140
interesting how we manage to run those

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:50,230
Edinburgh classes with that number of

82
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,910
people how do we run that virtually so

83
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,310
I've been looking at the technologies

84
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,560
involved I've been practicing with the

85
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,590
technologies involved and hopefully

86
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,510
we'll be able to come up experiment and

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,870
inspect and adapt towards some super

88
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,480
awesome classes and the other classes I

89
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:12,010
think that are going to be pretty good

90
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,230
online is the the professional agile

91
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,130
leadership which I have a class coming

92
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:20,980
up this month we moved to virtual and as

93
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:25,210
coming up in the the GMT time zone and I

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,610
have a agile leadership in the Mexico

95
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,740
City as well gonna move that to virtual

96
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,520
we'll see how that works I've got a

97
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,930
colleague that I'm working with to

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,400
deliver that in both English and Spanish

99
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:41,740
so hopefully that work out I'm also the

100
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,330
professional scrum of Kanban with Daniel

101
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,210
Vacanti then I'm running in month or so

102
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:51,330
we'll also be moved to virtual and

103
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,700
Daniel and I will be running that as a

104
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,590
co-teach over two days and we'll see if

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,590
that works out and I've been in touch

106
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,270
with the folks during during the

107
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,640
professor scrum at a man we actually use

108
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:10,240
the get Kanban game from get Kanban calm

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,070
and which I have physical copies of but

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,750
obviously that won't work for a virtual

111
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,520
class so how are we going to run that

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,680
I've been in touch with the folks that

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,090
get Kanban to see if they'd be willing

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,350
to implement a version of that of their

115
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,940
game on table topia table topia is a

116
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,520
virtualization platform for board games

117
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,890
I've been using that with some of my my

118
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,960
friends to play some be awesome board

119
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:40,569
games that we play I'm really figuring

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,699
out how to run these classes luck

121
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:44,259
from the dog community and has been

122
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,749
banding together we've been talking

123
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:50,740
about and exploring different options

124
00:06:46,749 --> 00:06:55,360
for how to do virtual class he's how we

125
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:58,869
break them up how we organize that so I

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,819
just want to make sure that the reason

127
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:03,069
we're that there is a session tonight a

128
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:05,169
future of work session with British

129
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:08,169
Computer Society I'm going to be talking

130
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,719
about scaling scrum to the enterprise

131
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,229
and hopefully be able to join us at 7:00

agility and DevOps if you want to talk

140
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,199

maybe I can just give you an answer and

149
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:05,729
let's let's figure out how to use this

150
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:09,849
time that we've all got enclosed in our

151
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:12,639
forms to the best benefit of everybody

152
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:15,819
else normally I'd be off at traveling

153
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,039
the world consulting in person which is

154
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:21,519
obviously my preferred way to work but

155
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,159
at the moment it's not possible so let

156
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:26,579
me know if you need any help if you just

157
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:29,490
want to chat I'm not talking about

158
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:33,339
charging you for that I'm talking about

159
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,919
just having a chat if we can spend half

160
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,259
hour on a call and figure something out

161
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,819
or I can do a webcast on a particular

162
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:46,209
topic that helps solve a problem for you

163
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:48,790
I'm super happy to do that if you're

164
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:52,569
looking to get two days of time with me

165
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,460
then we can figure that out as we go but

166
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:57,540
I'm really looking forward to

167
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,260
the different form are experimenting

168
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,330
inspecting and adapting with the

169
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:06,490
different forms of interaction that we

170
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:09,970
can have over the next months as we are

171
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,010
stuck where we are and luckily as I

172
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,060
consulted travel worldwide obviously I'm

173
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,550
happy to speak to and hear from anybody

174
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,940
anywhere in the world I've been training

175
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,190
in Saudi Arabia which was super fun very

176
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:28,209
different than I expected and I trained

177
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:31,209
in Ghana in Africa which is one of my

178
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:35,410
favorite places to be and I've also been

179
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:37,570
out to Azerbaijan as well so I'm happy

180
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,230
