okay this is Martin ho8 from Naked agility I come a few things that I wanted to mention tonight I'm going to be doing meetup for the future of work in conjunction with the British Computer Society at 7 p.m. UK time tonight 

I'm going to be talking about scaling dragons the the things that are going to be beneficial or destroyers as we move towards scaling agility and things that we need to consider and figure out so I think that will be good fun we're going to be I'm going to be talking about I'm going to be talking about scrum initially and then I'm going to be diving a little bit into Nexus but more from the perspective of the practices that really matter for a large-scale scrum team talk about them for a little bit and then maybe we'll touch a little bit on metrics and getting an understanding of some of the key at least starter metrics you might not be the metrics I'm going to talk about might not be valid for your organization but you can use them as a starter point as hints as a lead through towards understanding metrics that might be viable for your organization that's so that's scaling dragons tonight at 7 p.m. gmt with the future of work meetup in conjunction with the British Computer Society 

it's also going to stream live on YouTube LinkedIn and Facebook so if you can't get into those events you can certainly get into get into that but ultimately if you want to be in an interactive session then definitely head over to the Meetup and join in the folks that are organizing the meet are awesome and we're gonna have a good fun again that's future of work in conjunction with British Computer Society at 7:00 p.m. tonight 

I also wanted to mention that I'm working obviously there's no in-person events going on so any time that I've got a conference event we're going to be doing it online if the conference event is cancelled then I will record or do a live event anyway at the same time or separately off of that talk and so that people can join in and I'm also going to be moving some of my training classes to be live virtual classes this is a very complicated thing all of the scrum the dark classes that I teach are really designed to be high bandwidth impersonal classes so what I want to do is for the classes that make sense we're going to run some virtual classes we'll probably run them as kind of like a 2-day event and see what makes sense whether it makes sense to continue to run it as a two-day event or to balance that with like a you know dude over 40 is four half days or do two full days what what makes sense for for that training so I've been looking at the the professional scrum master and the professional scrum with you acts are ones that I think I'm going to run first in the next couple of weeks I have classes scheduled in Edinburgh for that so I want to convert them to live events 

it's going to be really interesting how we manage to run those Edinburgh classes with that number of people how do we run that virtually so I've been looking at the technologies involved I've been practicing with the technologies involved and hopefully we'll be able to come up experiment and inspect and adapt towards some super awesome classes and the other classes I think that are going to be pretty good online is the the professional agile leadership which I have a class coming up this month we moved to virtual and as coming up in the the GMT time zone and I have a agile leadership in the Mexico City as well gonna move that to virtual we'll see how that works I've got a colleague that I'm working with to deliver that in both English and Spanish so hopefully that work out 

I'm also the professional scrum of Kanban with Daniel Vacanti then I'm running in month or so we'll also be moved to virtual and Daniel and I will be running that as a co-teach over two days and we'll see if that works out and I've been in touch with the folks during during the professor scrum at a man we actually use the get Kanban game from get Kanban calm and which I have physical copies of but obviously that won't work for a virtual class so how are we going to run that I've been in touch with the folks that get Kanban to see if they'd be willing to implement a version of that of their game on table topia table topia is a virtualization platform for board games I've been using that with some of my my friends to play some be awesome board games that we play 

I'm really figuring out how to run these classes luck from the dog community and has been banding together we've been talking about and exploring different options for how to do virtual class he's how we break them up how we organize that so I just want to make sure that the reason we're that there is a session tonight a future of work session with British Computer Society I'm going to be talking about scaling scrum to the enterprise and hopefully be able to join us at 7:00 p.m. GMT tonight and it's been a stream live on Facebook and LinkedIn and YouTube so you should be able to test that ah feel free to follow me on Twitter get in touch if you have any questions I'm super happy to do sessions with anybody who needs it on both agility and DevOps if you want to talk about DevOps practices if you want to talk about maturity of a scrum team principles and values if you want to talk about and just as your DevOps DevOps in general whatever you want to talk about ping me on Twitter we can get on a call we can chat maybe you just have a question that you want an answer maybe I can just give you an answer and let's let's figure out how to use this time that we've all got enclosed in our forms to the best benefit of everybody else 

normally I'd be off at traveling the world consulting in person which is obviously my preferred way to work but at the moment it's not possible so let me know if you need any help if you just want to chat I'm not talking about charging you for that I'm talking about just having a chat if we can spend half hour on a call and figure something out or I can do a webcast on a particular topic that helps solve a problem for you I'm super happy to do that if you're looking to get two days of time with me then we can figure that out as we go but I'm really looking forward to the different form are experimenting inspecting and adapting with the different forms of interaction that we can have over the next months as we are stuck where we are and luckily as I consulted travel worldwide obviously I'm happy to speak to and hear from anybody anywhere in the world 

I've been training in Saudi Arabia which was super fun very different than I expected and I trained in Ghana in Africa which is one of my favorite places to be and I've also been out to Azerbaijan as well so I'm happy to work anywhere in the world you're mopping okay thanks very much for for listening and and I hope you you get in touch and follow me on Twitter to find out what's going on okay
