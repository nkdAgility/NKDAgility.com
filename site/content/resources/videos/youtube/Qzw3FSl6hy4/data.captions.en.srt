1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,440
what is product Discovery and why is it

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,559
different from what we've always

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,679
done man I would say it's not different

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,920
from what we've always done but it also

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,279
is different from what we've always done

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,279
so product

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:28,599
Discovery is all of the work that you

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,560
do that's about planning for the future

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,000
right so

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,520
if in order for a team to deliver some

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,360
piece of work you need to do a bunch of

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:46,640
research or you need to create some

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,680
designs or um or whatevers right another

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,280
team has to do something before it gets

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,800
to to to to our team all of that from

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,039
our perspective is Discovery work that

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,719
may be work work for the other team

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,359
right but from our perspective it's

19
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:07,960
discover work it's discovering this item

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:11,479
it's making um uh ensuring that we

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,560
understand that item as much as

22
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:17,640
possible and not just focused on the

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,680
items that we know we

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,000
want Discovery also focuses on the items

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,840
we don't know we

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,920
want

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,880
so how how do we

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,720
find the

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,280
things that are going to enable our

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,399
product to be better that's going to

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,640
enhance our users uh um experience

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:47,640
that's going to um open up new markets

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,119
increase our user base um those are all

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,960
things that we would do as part of

35
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
Discovery um scrum calls it refinement

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,280
right although I think refinements

37
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,719
probably a little bit tighter scope than

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,680
than Discovery discover is a lot bigger

39
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,400
um but it's something that we have

40
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,560
always done it's just not always been

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,560
explicit it's not always been something

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,160
that we say this is that body of work

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,640
who's accountable for organizing that

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
body of work and in the scrum world that

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,760
would be the the product owner right

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,239
they're accountable for for maximizing

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,879
the value of the work done in the

48
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,840
product but in whatever

49
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,519
process you're

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:41,480
using somebody needs to be directing

51
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,200
that it's it's not

52
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,400
necessarily okay for there to be no

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,840
Direction so part of Discovery will be

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
figuring out what your what your goals

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,280
are what your vision is and what your

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,920
goals are what is it you're trying to

57
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,120
achieve as a business or what is it that

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,760
your product's trying to achieve um what

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
direction are you you are you are you

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,720
going and then what are the steps you

61
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,400
want to try and take to get there and

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,720
then figuring out what do you need to do

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,959
in your product to get there um a great

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,560
great

65
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:20,159
um example I think at scale is the Azure

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,120
devops team at least when I worked with

67
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,440
them a few years ago the the scale of

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,959
that team I think they were up to 90

69
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,519
plus teams at one point working on this

70
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,120
one big product so that's that's a lot

71
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,599
of work to feed that that that engine

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,159
that is delivering delivering value that

73
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,599
those teams working together hopefully

74
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,159
highly effective teams but

75
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,120
teams

76
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,280
so they set strategic Direction at the

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,480
at the high level and then there's a

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,799
bunch of discovery that has to go on at

79
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,879
that level like where are we going what

80
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,439
are we doing what are we trying to

81
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
achieve right think of it like that's

82
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,640
like portfolio what are your value

83
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,640
propositions for your product how how do

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,920
you think you're going to be able to to

85
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,079
to affect those and then they come up

86
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,200
with ideas through through the structure

87
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,920
this is what we want to build and then

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,280
send it to the next level down within

89
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,239
that larger product organization and say

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,040
this is what we're trying to achieve you

91
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,680
go figure out what's going to make it

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,400
happen so then Discovery launches again

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,840
at that level what do we think perhaps

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,600
this is a as your boards right we're

95
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,199
trying to help the business achieve this

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,560
outcome they're trying to achieve what

97
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,360
do we think we can do to help make

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,919
progress towards towards that that goal

99
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:50,080
or those goals right um and then they

100
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,600
might have 20 teams working on that idea

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,600
so they would create their level like

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,360
what is it we think we're going to try

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,160
and Achieve how do we want to move the

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,919
needles um and then they're going to

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,880
give that to the teams below and the

106
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,280
teams below are going to be like okay

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,560
here's what we're trying to achieve all

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,479
the way up the chain right all the way

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,759
up to the product Vision um what do we

110
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,479
need to do to make progress towards

111
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,440
those goals in that Vision actually a

112
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,319
really good example I I've got another

113
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,759
example which is maybe more people have

114
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:27,199
experience of and at the holistic level

115
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:31,520
and that's the the the windows team or

116
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:35,639
Windows Microsoft as a whole across many

117
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,560
products um has a a a like

118
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:42,479
a a strategic goal it's for six months

119
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,080
right they they um Microsoft calls it

120
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
the season B I don't know if they call

121
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,880
it this right but I looking in observing

122
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,600
what they're doing many people call it

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,319
the season based model um so they have a

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,199
a six months in a

125
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,919
season uh and they're looking out three

126
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:04,039
seasons current season plus two more

127
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,759
right so that could be up to 18 months

128
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,960
but somewhere between six and 18 months

129
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,199
they're looking out and one of the

130
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,160
things that they wanted to go after the

131
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,080
market shares that they wanted to go

132
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,400
after as a business um from their

133
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,880
consumer products was creators so there

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,280
are people writing books there are

135
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,599
people um drawing pictures there are

136
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,919
people making music

137
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,400
on on computers right we want to go

138
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,280
after that group of people that market

139
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,360
share and we want to increase our market

140
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,840
share in that space so they created this

141
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,400
idea of the creators update that's kind

142
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,479
of what they call it right that the

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,800
again they do a a spring and a fall

144
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,759
update across the board that's kind of

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
like that that Cadence of the Season

146
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,039
based model the six months so within

147
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,319
that six months they're overriding

148
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:05,160
product goal product Focus across all of

149
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:09,879
their products season focus is to

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,520
um help creators create stuff that's

151
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,639
that's that that overarching thing and

152
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,240
then each team each group each product

153
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,680
group and then each team inside of that

154
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,440
that works under that story is trying to

155
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,360
figure out what can we do to help

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,759
further that so I remember the the the I

157
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,520
don't have one here but the pen support

158
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:39,479
folks in Microsoft moved from uh

159
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,199
255 pressure levels to 1024 pressure

160
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,360
levels that was one of the things they

161
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,400
did so that required the people who make

162
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,520
the pen the people who make the screens

163
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,319
um the people who make the the operating

164
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,599
system right to all work together in

165
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,960
order to work towards this this idea of

166
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,039
improving pen support and that was to

167
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,120
enable artists and enable that and then

168
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,319
they have software that comes off that

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,400
and they create sdks and all this thing

170
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,960
so that other people can build products

171
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,520
on top of that that that was one of the

172
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,879
Endeavors in that and that was just for

173
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,199
drawing on the screen or writing on the

174
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,319
screen right

175
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,520
um that effort to all work

176
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,800
together improved their market share

177
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,720
right in the in the Creator space that's

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,440
what they were trying to do but then

179
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,479
they realized during right they've got

180
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
their three six months three seasons

181
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,680
planned out they just finished the

182
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,279
creators season so they their product is

183
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,519
shipped it's everybody's 950 million

184
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,800
people using Windows and I don't know

185
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,320
how many of them are creators right but

186
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,279
they're getting feedback and Telemetry

187
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,240
and uh getting all that stuff and then

188
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,480
they realized that they needed another

189
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,920
creators update because they didn't

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
quite move the needle as far as they

191
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,600
would like there was certain feedback

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,800
there was certain and then they're going

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,800
to do that again all of that is product

194
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:07,279
Discovery so it's it's really big it

195
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,519
depends on the scale of your

196
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,519
organization right how how much uh how

197
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:17,120
big the scope is but that is the scope

198
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,839
of product discovery that you and

199
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,519
everyone in your organization should be

200
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,480
focused on from the lowest person doing

201
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,959
the work all the way up through the

202
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:32,600
business to whoever is in charge of of

203
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,000
of of that whatever level you roll up to

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,079
right so that could be Azure devops

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,440
rolling up to the head of azure devops

206
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,279
um but then it eventually rolls up to

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Satia right the CEO of the organization

208
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,800
and Satia has lots of products and lots

209
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,160
of different parts of the business from

210
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,680
from uh consumer focused parts of the

211
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
business to non-consumer focused parts

212
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,040
of the business seven business focus

213
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,720
part the business so how do we enable

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,440
and align all of these things so that we

215
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,399
are an entity that's all working

216
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,839
together towards these common goals

217
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,680
towards these common outcomes and that

218
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:15,760
is part of product Discovery because you

219
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,279
deciding what your product needs isn't

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,880
necessarily going to create the best

221
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,560
outcomes

222
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,600
because we're narrow we're narrowing the

223
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,000
choices to what you can

224
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,839
imagine if we expand it out to include

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,720
all of the people working on your

226
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,600
product we are

227
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,200
diversifying and perhaps generating more

228
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,160
ideas for how we can solve these

229
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,680
problems in more interesting ways and

230
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,480
help our customers even more and open

231
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,320
out new markets and new capabilities and

232
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,839
new ways of doing things and that yeah

233
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,200
product Discovery is huge it's huge and

234
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,040
it it is very underserved in

235
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,000
organizations it's not very deliberate

236
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,000
in

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,120
organizations um and that's one of the

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,079
things

239
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:08,000
one of the reasons uh that there's a lot

240
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:11,320
of shift in focus in the market towards

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,360
towards product many teams are good

242
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,639
engineering teams they're they're good

243
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,880
at building solid usable working product

244
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:25,240
on a regular Cadence um but if they're

245
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,000
not provided with focus and Direction

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,600
they're not going to go anywhere if that

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,160
focus and Direction doesn't provide

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,040
additional market share additional

249
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,040
Market opportunities then the investment

250
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,600
goes away right there's only so long

251
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,839
companies will invest in something that

252
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,440
they don't feel like they're getting a

253
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:46,360
return on so product Discovery is all of

254
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,839
those things that happen within the

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:52,639
business in order for people to figure

256
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,639
out what they're going to go build
