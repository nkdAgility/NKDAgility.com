# What is product discovery and how does it differ from how we've always developed products?

What is Product Discovery and Why It‚Äôs Crucial?

üìò Introduction: Understanding Product Discovery

- What is Product Discovery?
  - Product discovery is the critical work done to plan for the future of a product.
  - It‚Äôs about more than just executing tasks; it‚Äôs about uncovering what needs to be built, understanding the market, and anticipating user needs.

üîç Key Concepts in Product Discovery

1. üîÑ Continuous Exploration:
   - Product discovery isn‚Äôt a one-time task; it‚Äôs an ongoing process of exploring and identifying both the known and unknown elements that could improve the product.
   - It includes everything from research and design to collaboration with other teams to ensure a holistic understanding of what‚Äôs needed.

2. üß† Expanding Beyond the Obvious:
   - Discovery isn‚Äôt just about what you know you need; it‚Äôs also about uncovering needs and opportunities you didn‚Äôt realize were there.
   - This proactive approach can lead to better user experiences, new market opportunities, and increased user base.

3. üìä Strategic Direction & Alignment:
   - At scale, discovery involves setting strategic directions and aligning various teams and departments to work towards common goals.
   - For example, large organizations like Microsoft engage in discovery to coordinate across numerous teams, ensuring everyone is moving towards the same objectives.

4. üîç Refinement vs. Discovery:
   - While Scrum calls part of this process "refinement," discovery is broader, encompassing everything from the initial idea to the final product.
   - It‚Äôs not just about fine-tuning; it‚Äôs about exploring new possibilities and ensuring that every decision aligns with the overall vision.

üöÄ Real-World Examples of Product Discovery

1. Azure DevOps Example:
   - With over 90 teams working on a single product, Azure DevOps illustrates the scale and complexity of product discovery.
   - Strategic direction is set at a high level, and discovery is essential at every stage to ensure that all teams are aligned and contributing to the overall goal.

2. Microsoft‚Äôs Creators Update:
   - Microsoft‚Äôs focus on the "Creators Update" is an example of how discovery leads to tangible outcomes.
   - By targeting creators (writers, artists, musicians), Microsoft enhanced its products to better serve this market, which involved coordinated efforts across multiple teams.

üéØ The Importance of Product Discovery

- Why It Matters:
  - Without a strong discovery process, even the best engineering teams can fail to deliver real value.
  - Discovery ensures that the team‚Äôs efforts are focused on the right problems, leading to better outcomes for the business.

- Aligning Teams & Goals:
  - Discovery aligns everyone from the lowest-level team members to the highest-level executives, ensuring that all efforts contribute to the organization‚Äôs strategic goals.

Conclusion: The Power of Deliberate Discovery

- Product Discovery is Underserved:
  - Despite its importance, many organizations don‚Äôt give enough attention to deliberate discovery.
  - Shifting focus towards this can unlock new market opportunities and enhance the value delivered to customers.

- The Future of Product Development:
  - Teams that excel at discovery are not just executing; they‚Äôre innovating, creating, and driving the business forward.
