Product Discovery is a term that's often used in the world of product development, but what does it really mean? Is it something new, or is it just a different label for what we've always done? In this post, I'll delve into the nuances of Product Discovery, explain why itâ€™s critical to your productâ€™s success, and share some real-world examples to help you understand its scope and impact.

## **What is Product Discovery?**

Product Discovery encompasses all the work involved in planning for the future of your product. It's about identifying what you need to do to make your product better, more valuable, and more appealing to your users. While it might seem similar to what we've always done, Product Discovery adds a layer of intentionality and scope that goes beyond traditional methods like Scrum's refinement.

### **The Dual Nature of Product Discovery**

- **Planning for the Future**: Product Discovery involves researching, designing, and understanding what needs to be done before a product can be delivered. This might include market research, user feedback, or technical feasibility studies.

- **Uncovering the Unknown**: Unlike traditional planning, Product Discovery also focuses on the unknownsâ€”the potential opportunities or problems that havenâ€™t yet been identified. This proactive approach ensures that youâ€™re not just reacting to current needs but are also anticipating future demands.

### **Discovery vs. Refinement**

In Scrum, we often talk about refinement, but Product Discovery is broader. While refinement is about breaking down and understanding specific items in the backlog, Product Discovery is about the bigger pictureâ€”identifying new opportunities, exploring uncharted territories, and setting strategic directions.

## **Why Product Discovery is Essential**

So why is Product Discovery so important? Simply put, itâ€™s about maximizing the value of your product by ensuring that youâ€™re working on the right things, in the right way, and at the right time.

### **Strategic Direction and Goals**

Every successful product starts with a clear vision and goals. Product Discovery helps you define what youâ€™re trying to achieve as a business and how your product fits into that vision. Itâ€™s about setting a direction and then figuring out the steps you need to take to get there.

- **Example**: Think of the Azure DevOps team at Microsoft. At one point, they had over 90 teams working on a single product. To keep everything aligned, they set a high-level strategic direction. Each level of the organization then engaged in its own discovery process to figure out how to contribute to that overarching goal.

### **The Scale of Product Discovery**

The scale of Product Discovery can vary depending on the size and complexity of your organization. For a small team, it might be a relatively straightforward process. But for a large organization, Product Discovery can be a massive undertaking, involving multiple teams and layers of decision-making.

- **Portfolio-Level Discovery**: At a high level, organizations need to define their value propositions, set strategic goals, and decide on the initiatives that will drive progress toward those goals. This might involve market research, competitive analysis, and long-term planning.

- **Team-Level Discovery**: Each team within the organization then takes those high-level goals and translates them into actionable plans. This involves figuring out what features to build, what user needs to address, and how to measure success.

## **Real-World Examples of Product Discovery**

Letâ€™s take a look at some real-world examples to see how Product Discovery works in practice.

### **The Azure DevOps Example**

As mentioned earlier, the Azure DevOps team at Microsoft had to manage a massive product with multiple teams contributing to its development. They set a strategic direction at the portfolio level, and then each team engaged in discovery to figure out how to move the needle on their specific goals.

- **What They Did**: The teams conducted research, gathered feedback, and explored new ideas to enhance the product. This iterative process of discovery ensured that every team was aligned with the overall vision and contributed to the productâ€™s success.

### **The Microsoft Creators Update**

Another great example is Microsoftâ€™s approach to product updates. They follow a season-based model, planning their product goals in six-month increments. One of their major initiatives was the Creators Update, aimed at increasing market share among creative professionals like artists, writers, and musicians.

- **How They Did It**: Microsoft focused on enhancing tools and features that would appeal to creators. For example, they increased the pressure levels of their digital pens from 255 to 1024, improving the experience for artists using their devices. This required coordination across multiple teams, from hardware to software, all working together towards a common goal.

- **The Result**: The Creators Update successfully expanded Microsoftâ€™s market share in the creative space. But Product Discovery didnâ€™t stop there. They continued to gather feedback and recognized the need for a follow-up update to address further opportunities and challenges.

## **The Broader Impact of Product Discovery**

Product Discovery isnâ€™t just about making better productsâ€”itâ€™s about making better decisions. Itâ€™s about aligning your entire organization, from the C-suite to the development teams, around a shared vision and goals.

### **Expanding the Possibilities**

One of the most powerful aspects of Product Discovery is that it opens up possibilities that you might not have considered otherwise. When you involve more people in the discovery process, you tap into a wider range of ideas and perspectives. This can lead to more innovative solutions and better outcomes for your product.

- **Diversifying Ideas**: By involving everyone in your organization in the discovery process, you generate more ideas for solving problems and identifying opportunities. This not only helps improve your product but also opens up new markets and capabilities.

### **The Need for Deliberate Focus**

Despite its importance, Product Discovery is often underserved in organizations. Many teams are great at building solid products, but without deliberate focus and direction, those products might not achieve their full potential.

- **Investment and Return**: Companies invest in product development with the expectation of a return. If your product doesnâ€™t deliver additional market share or opportunities, that investment may dry up. Product Discovery ensures that youâ€™re always working towards goals that will provide a meaningful return on investment.

## **Final Thoughts**

Product Discovery is not just a buzzwordâ€”itâ€™s a critical process that can make or break your productâ€™s success. Whether youâ€™re working on a small team or a large organization, taking the time to engage in thorough Product Discovery will pay off in the long run.

- **Remember**:
    - Set clear strategic goals and align your teams around them.
    
    - Involve everyone in the discovery process to generate diverse ideas.
    
    - Keep an eye on the big picture, but donâ€™t forget the details.
    
    - Continuously gather feedback and adjust your course as needed.

By embracing Product Discovery, youâ€™re not just building a productâ€”youâ€™re building a future for your business. ðŸš€
