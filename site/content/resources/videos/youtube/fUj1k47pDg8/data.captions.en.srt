1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,480
let's start with the why why PPD V

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:11,320
course was

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,280
created based on our

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,600
observations uh how companies work how

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:22,600
teams work seems there is still a lot of

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:27,880
attention when it comes to delivery one

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:30,519
may also think that hey if we have to

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,640
put just one goal of every spr what is

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,239
the most important that we have to

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:41,000
achieve is creating increment product

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:44,239
increment done product increment

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,879
so seems this is an important topic

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:52,160
right but this is not

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:55,879
enough and we I believe forget although

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,480
we emphasize this a lot that we are

16
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:03,600
solving complex

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,119
problems what does it mean we along this

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
product development Journey we will make

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,119
a lot of

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,640
assumptions what is even worse some of

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,000
those assumptions in some of the cases I

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,920
would dare to say even majority of them

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,079
might be made

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:29,079
unconsciously so we made an assumption

25
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,640
we take Next Step but we miss learning

26
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:35,119
opportunity

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,040
and this may lead us to feature Factory

28
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,840
problem of course we have a lot of memes

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:46,759
and stories like hey strong stakeholders

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,799
stakeholder driven development and T

31
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,479
here we go we have feature Factory

32
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,280
problem in place but if we think about

33
00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,479
it deeper there might be a lot of

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,399
factors affecting affecting this

35
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,160
problem maybe we have insufficient user

36
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,959
understanding maybe we believe that what

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:16,120
our users say is the truth well this is

38
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,920
what they say but guess what do we

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,640
really understand what is the need do we

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:28,680
have all data evidence to find the best

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,640
ways to bring solutions to fulfill users

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,440
needs

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,040
this is a valid

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:40,959
question maybe we are facing reactionary

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,680
development okay customers want it

46
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,560
because competitors did it is it really

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,040
so that's another question maybe we are

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,680
facing insufficient collaboration with

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,319
our stakeholders and this is not the

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,640
healthy

51
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,879
collaboration and maybe we have chosen

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,519
wrong metrics we we have a misalignment

53
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:09,440
here all those things may may cause

54
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,959
problem that we call Feature Feature

55
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,120
Factory

56
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,599
problem so what do we want to to do with

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,280
this course we want to emphasize the

58
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,920
topic of

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,239
assumptions in the complex world in the

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,360
complex

61
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,400
environment we don't know many things in

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:35,080
fact we in many cases we don't know what

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:40,760
we don't know yet so that's why this

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,439
path towards creating high value towards

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,560
creating valuable products and solutions

66
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:51,200
to the customers should be some kind of

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,959
way how we navigate around

68
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,439
assumptions our biggest question is what

69
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:04,000
works best for the

70
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:07,400
user and and to find the answer with

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
with the knowledge gained in that course

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,239
we will Embrace that in fact full

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,799
endtoend

74
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:22,360
empirical cycle uh requires

75
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,120
Discovery delivery and validation so

76
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,160
those three

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:31,639
elements work together to help us

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,400
navigate around those

79
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,880
assumptions so our new

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:42,440
course is designed for product leaders

81
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,479
product owners product managers but also

82
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,840
for product teams in

83
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,280
general we believe that everyone

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,960
involved in the product development

85
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,199
process will benefit from from this

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,400
class so this class is designed to be

87
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:07,680
one day course so around 8 hours which

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:11,880
can be also split into two half days or

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:16,360
smaller smaller chunks in this class we

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:19,560
will use case study that will help us

91
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,880
navigate through different concepts

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,440
through this whole story how to better

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,560
incorporate Discovery and validation

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:35,120
into product uh development

95
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,919
process thanks to that we will get

96
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,520
familiar with working with assumptions

97
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:47,759
experimentation collecting evidence and

98
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,080
important word for this class learning

99
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:56,720
so it will be a conscious learning how

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,720
to build better and better products
