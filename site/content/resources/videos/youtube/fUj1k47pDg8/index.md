Let’s dive into a topic that’s been on my mind lately: the importance of addressing assumptions in product development. As I’ve observed in various organisations, there’s often a heavy focus on delivery—specifically, the creation of product increments. While this is undoubtedly a crucial goal, I believe we’re missing a vital piece of the puzzle: the complex problems we’re trying to solve along the way.

### The Assumption Trap

In our rush to deliver, we often make assumptions—sometimes without even realising it. This can lead to missed learning opportunities and, ultimately, the dreaded feature factory problem. You know the one I mean: where teams churn out features without truly understanding user needs or the underlying problems they’re trying to solve.

Here are a few factors that contribute to this issue:

- **Insufficient User Understanding**: We might take what users say at face value, but do we really grasp their needs? It’s essential to dig deeper and gather data that informs our decisions.
  
- **Reactionary Development**: Often, we find ourselves developing features simply because competitors have done so. This knee-jerk reaction can lead us astray.
  
- **Poor Collaboration**: Healthy collaboration with stakeholders is crucial. If we’re not engaging effectively, we risk misalignment and confusion.
  
- **Misguided Metrics**: Choosing the wrong metrics can skew our understanding of success and lead us down the wrong path.

### Navigating Complexity

This brings me to the core of our new PPD V course. We aim to emphasise the significance of understanding assumptions in a complex environment. In many cases, we don’t even know what we don’t know. This uncertainty is why we need a structured approach to navigate our way through product development.

Our primary question throughout this journey is: **What works best for the user?** To answer this, we’ll explore a full end-to-end empirical cycle that encompasses discovery, delivery, and validation. These three elements are interdependent and essential for navigating assumptions effectively.

### Who Is This Course For?

This course is designed for:

- Product leaders
- Product owners
- Product managers
- Product teams

In essence, anyone involved in the product development process will find value in this class. It’s structured as a one-day course, approximately eight hours long, but we can also break it down into two half-day sessions or smaller chunks to suit your needs.

### What to Expect

Throughout the course, we’ll engage with a case study that illustrates how to incorporate discovery and validation into the product development process. Here’s what you can expect to learn:

- **Working with Assumptions**: We’ll explore how to identify and challenge assumptions that may hinder our progress.
  
- **Experimentation**: You’ll learn how to design experiments that provide valuable insights into user needs and preferences.
  
- **Collecting Evidence**: We’ll discuss methods for gathering data that informs our decisions and validates our hypotheses.
  
- **Conscious Learning**: This course is all about fostering a culture of learning, enabling us to build better products over time.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the PPD V course is not just about delivering product increments; it’s about fostering a mindset that prioritises understanding and learning. By addressing our assumptions and embracing a more empirical approach, we can create products that truly meet user needs and drive value.

I’m excited to share this journey with you and look forward to seeing how we can all improve our product development processes together. Let’s break free from the feature factory mentality and focus on what really matters: delivering value to our users.
