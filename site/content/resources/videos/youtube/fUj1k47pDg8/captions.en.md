Let's start with the why. Why was the PPD V course created? Based on our observations of how companies work and how teams work, it seems there is still a lot of attention when it comes to delivery. One may also think that, hey, if we have to put just one goal of every sprint, what is the most important thing that we have to achieve? It is creating a product increment. Done. Product increment. 

So, it seems this is an important topic, right? But this is not enough, and I believe we forget, although we emphasise this a lot, that we are solving complex problems. What does it mean? We, along this product development journey, will make a lot of assumptions. What is even worse, some of those assumptions, in some cases, I would dare to say even the majority of them, might be made unconsciously. 

So, we made an assumption, we take the next step, but we miss a learning opportunity. This may lead us to the feature factory problem. Of course, we have a lot of memes and stories like, "Hey, strong stakeholders, stakeholder-driven development," and here we go, we have the feature factory problem in place. But if we think about it deeper, there might be a lot of factors affecting this problem. 

Maybe we have insufficient user understanding. Maybe we believe that what our users say is the truth. Well, this is what they say, but guess what? Do we really understand what the need is? Do we have all the data evidence to find the best ways to bring solutions to fulfil users' needs? This is a valid question. 

Maybe we are facing reactionary development. Okay, customers want it because competitors did it. Is it really so? That's another question. Maybe we are facing insufficient collaboration with our stakeholders, and this is not the healthy collaboration. And maybe we have chosen the wrong metrics. We have a misalignment here. All those things may cause the problem that we call the feature factory problem. 

So, what do we want to do with this course? We want to emphasise the topic of assumptions in the complex world. In the complex environment, we don't know many things. In fact, in many cases, we don't know what we don't know yet. So, that's why this path towards creating high value, towards creating valuable products and solutions for the customers, should be some kind of way how we navigate around assumptions. 

Our biggest question is: what works best for the user? To find the answer with the knowledge gained in that course, we will embrace that. In fact, a full end-to-end empirical cycle requires discovery, delivery, and validation. So, those three elements work together to help us navigate around those assumptions. 

Our new course is designed for product leaders, product owners, product managers, but also for product teams in general. We believe that everyone involved in the product development process will benefit from this class. This class is designed to be a one-day course, so around eight hours, which can also be split into two half days or smaller chunks. 

In this class, we will use a case study that will help us navigate through different concepts throughout this whole story, how to better incorporate discovery and validation into the product development process. Thanks to that, we will get familiar with working with assumptions, experimentation, collecting evidence, and an important word for this class: learning. 

So, it will be a conscious learning process on how to build better and better products.
