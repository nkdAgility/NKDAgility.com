68
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:34,939

00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:36,649
time of the pod right he thinks he's got

70
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:45,339
planned but he hasn't done our web

71
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:45,339
conference with me before distant future

72
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:58,910

73
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,439
ok I think we should start thanks money

74
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,709
to class yeah that's given a revealer

75
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:07,129
chance to jump back on right welcome

76
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:10,040
everyone thanks for joining us let's say

77
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:13,430
second event future work in Scotland

78
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,730
available a year this one obviously we'd

79
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,139
originally planted to do APA well then

80
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,050
you have used before but the

81
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,309
circumstances obviously speak it remotes

82
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,800
got there no thanks for being with us

83
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:27,529
this one has a little bit of other

84
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,569
significance actually because it's doing

85
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,480
it in collaboration with the VCS agile

86
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:35,269
methods group that's a phosphor date not

87
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,639
without she done as amethyst because

88
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,370
because our klieg and I both a part of

89
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,410
the the BCS agile methods committee and

90
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,050
this is a foster this is Nigel methods

91
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,120
event we've done in Scotland so are the

92
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,410
significance for some of us so that's

93
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,380
happened all cold air will do more over

94
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,630
the year over the rest of the year

95
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,640
time to come hopefully some place to

96
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,700
face was late in the year but to Martin

97
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,700
thinks I'm being optimistic we do have a

98
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,650
code of conduct and those of you who

99
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:11,120
have attended some other events familiar

100
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:12,529
with it we do have one so please do

101
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,880
familiarize yourself with it it's

102
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:18,880
available on the hive in short things

103
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,560
and they will do will do some community

104
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,350
showcase for some other father they

105
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,910
start coming up over the coming weeks as

106
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,430
well all confined to our homes Q&A so

107
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,420
just quickly we will do a Q&A at the end

108
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,120
once Martin's

109
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,110
fellows presentations so I think we have

110
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,730
a chat facility right here so if he can

111
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,770
start you know putting any questions

112
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,920
that come up as as Marcus doing his

113
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,580
presentation and Donnell denial can sit

114
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,589
through them and we'll reel him back to

115
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,060
Martin's week and he can answer the

116
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:57,890
questions that come up at the end so

117
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:02,450
hopefully that's a decent format for

118
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:06,190
everyone and with that I think just

119
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:08,900
introduce our speaker so tomorrow and I

120
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,800
for a few years now in fact I did

121
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:16,070
Martin's a scrum divorce a professional

122
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,330
scrum cleaning a few years ago now in

123
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,960
fact I think it may have been one of the

124
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:22,550
first ones in Scotland so Martin does

125
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:27,980
what's come to or training or what

126
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:29,589
consultancy Joe and DevOps and yeah I'm

127
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:33,110
really looking forward to is

128
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:37,640
presentation tonight giving one of its

129
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:41,000
personal experiences doing an agility in

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:46,130
the enterprise so with that I'll hand

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,410
over to Martin Martin folks

132
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:51,709
hopefully this is going to going to go

133
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,330
well it's it is kind of being recorded

134
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:58,310
it's streaming live on lots of different

135
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,339
platforms

136
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,980
I'm not sure how good the the Sundays or

137
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,260
whether anybody could hear SAS that

138
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,450
format

139
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,390
but yeah we're all here anyways so it

140
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,160
doesn't it doesn't matter

141
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,380
I'm both the professional scrum trainer

142
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,040
likes that said but also our Microsoft

143
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,420
MVP as well in DevOps and I kind of kind

144
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,500
of split that difference a little bit

145
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,050
between the technical skills required to

146
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,560
deliver deliver software it's skill as

147
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:34,080
well as the the the process ideas of you

148
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,290
know keeping it simple like we all try

149
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,630
and do so I create this presentation a

150
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,400
little while ago it had various names

151
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,340
sling the dragons and how to

152
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,290
successfully descale that skill is just

153
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,890
the most recent one I think it was

154
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:54,180
unicorns last year taming the unicorns

155
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:58,410
but the idea is the same

156
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:04,410
that we really need to China talked

157
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:07,310
about various things that are not just a

158
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:11,520
problem at scale but things that we know

159
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,550
work pretty well that you can try so

160
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,160
nothing here I'm going to say is you

161
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,560
must do it this way absolutely not

162
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,950
you need to figure out what works best

163
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,560
with in your organizational context and

164
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,150
that can be that can be difficult

165
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:34,470
depending on on what it is you're doing

166
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:37,620
so let's start off and if anybody wants

167
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,240
to get in touch with me later please do

168
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:46,470
any way you like I'm pretty much

169
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,940
everywhere I'm in Glasgow that's where

170
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,050
I'm based and that's where I am

171
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,600
currently confined like everybody else

172
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:57,060
so if you do do need something I'm here

173
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,510
and in the in the time zone and I did

174
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,760
see there's a few folks I know from

175
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,850
other countries logged on and I saw Anna

176
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,820
an organ did were logged on so it was a

177
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,520
few few people from further afield

178
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:15,660
European time zones

179
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:17,190
the thing that's behind what I'm talking

180
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,100
about is that that idea you've probably

181
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,790
seen this before firms today experience

182
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,820
a much high

183
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,950
velocity of business change business is

184
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,610
changing a lot more quickly and we need

185
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:32,640
to keep up and it's not just about

186
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:37,260
process it's a balance between process

187
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,630
and engineering without good engineering

188
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,600
skills we might build a lot of the right

189
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,080
thing but it will not be very good or

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,600
not meet the need and without the

191
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,850
process skills were maybe not build the

192
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,260
thing we're supposed to build so I've

193
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:57,270
got a little story first and that I've

194
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,100
used a couple of times before I I find

195
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,530
it quite well it's kind of amusing

196
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,690
cannon art but it's the story of how our

197
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,890
company with nearly 400 million dollars

198
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:09,890
in the bank went bankrupt in about 45

199
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,790
minutes because of a field deployment

200
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,710
some of you might have heard this story

201
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:18,720
it's from the knight Capital Group and

202
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:22,380
in in the US and there are fortune 500

203
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,070
or not fortune 500 was a Gulf New York

204
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,390
Stock Exchange company and I need a new

205
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,310
feature they were deploying to

206
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,860
production it was some kind of new order

207
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:36,500
handling feature that changed the way

208
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:39,990
that worked and and while they were

209
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:44,040
replacing all old stuff with knew they

210
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:46,290
had Cain Anna am a big legacy and you

211
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,330
you know what it's like in in in your

212
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,680
teams today there's usually anything

213
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,840
that's been around for a while there's a

214
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,490
lot of technical debt in the system a

215
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,440
lot of spaghetti code that ends up

216
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,680
sitting around for ages on last year

217
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,650
teams continuously refactor and focus on

218
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,870
engineering excellence so this idea is

219
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,760
they hadn't can a nine year old unused

220
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,940
code and they decided to repurpose a

221
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,790
flag in the system you know there's this

222
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,250
flag sitting there it's not doing much

223
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,710
let's just use that in order to turn

224
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,300
this new code on and and when they did a

225
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:22,410
deployment they were doing manual

226
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:25,340
deployments and the technician only

227
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,720
deployed to seven of the eight servers

228
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,330
so you can imagine when soon as they

229
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,279
turned the flag on something weird

230
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:39,050
started happening and it actually took

231
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,790
it took it took the whole system then it

232
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,740
wasn't operating correctly so they

233
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,040
weren't getting the the orders through

234
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,170
they were expecting and because the

235
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,680
system was down and they were losing

236
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:54,860
about a hundred and seventy thousand

237
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,050
dollars per minute and as you can

238
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,629
imagine that set off a lot of alarm

239
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:02,209
bells and they go - ever trying fix it

240
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:04,250
but when they try and fix it the the

241
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,280
they can't figure out what the problem

242
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,699
is because it's the amount of code they

243
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,049
deployed is too much the flag had

244
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,669
unintended consequences and the the

245
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,640
deployment to seven of eight the eight

246
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:22,579
servers even the technician that did the

247
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,039
work didn't really understand that

248
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,260
that's what they've done so there was no

249
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,270
visibility or transparency into that

250
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,090
because it was a manual deployment a

251
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,780
step or a couple of steps or something

252
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,450
was skipped and not noticed and I'm the

253
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:41,230
ended the day four hundred and sixty

254
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,899
million dollars down and had to file for

255
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:48,140
bankruptcy and I think the important

256
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:53,059
question there is what would be the

257
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:55,520
impact in your organization of a

258
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:58,970
critical system that folks write code

259
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,850
for or that deployed being being down

260
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,520
for for a day for two days some big

261
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,190
examples recently where some airlines

262
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,840
that was British Airways went down

263
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,870
American Airlines went down for three

264
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,490
days because of a mainframe fault that

265
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,640
you can't get any more technical debt

266
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,510
the mainframe sitting there and in this

267
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,740
particular case because it was a public

268
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,820
company because it's on the stock

269
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:30,890
exchange they have to do an SEC filing

270
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:32,809
for bankruptcy and you know that's how

271
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:36,559
we know so much about it you can go and

272
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:39,020
look up this filing and see exactly what

273
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,340
the what the problems were and 2013 is

274
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,870
not really that long ago

275
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,030
they really should have known better and

276
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,070
even around that in fact later than the

277
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:51,270
2013 timeframe I worked with an

278
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,330
organization in the Netherlands around

279
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:58,270
2014-2015 and they were an international

280
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:02,410
bank and they are real time banking

281
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,880
transaction system the servers five

282
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,460
servers around the world that govern

283
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,150
this weren't there so their code was not

284
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,160
under source control and the team they

285
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,800
organized it believed that source

286
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,980
control would slow them down and so in

287
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,350
order to make changes to this real-time

288
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:23,740
banking transaction system for an

289
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,230
international bank they would log on to

290
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,390
one of the servers open up their IDE

291
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:34,360
make changes to the code and compile it

292
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,430
on the production server I did ask how

293
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,010
do you share that code across all five

294
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,590
servers and the response was that's why

295
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,750
this five of us so each of the servers

296
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:47,320
are owned by one of the engineers the

297
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,150
engineer goes on to that individual

298
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,340
server that's their server and they

299
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,890
write and maintain the code on that

300
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,180
server so they've got five servers all

301
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,240
doing the same thing that all have

302
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:01,570
different code and different setup and

303
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,580
for me that was a huge business risk but

304
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,470
for the business the bigger risk or at

305
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,870
least for management of that group the

306
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,940
bigger risk was that this team was the

307
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,880
only team that understood what to do so

308
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,070
they get to write the rules and that can

309
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,680
often be the kids little fiefdom at

310
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,290
cropping up as well so how do we not

311
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,730
have this happen and we need to get need

312
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,560
to get better at it you need to practice

313
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,760
do it often do it all the time

314
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,070
that's kind of the moral of that story

315
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,820
automate everything you should have any

316
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,700
manual practices in your in your process

317
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,470
your delivery from developer committing

318
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,150
code all the way through to being in

319
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,460
production should be totally automated

320
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,560
you might have approvals along the way

321
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,990
but the approval should be you know

322
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,850
clicking a button ticking a box and not

323
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,920
actually following any technical steps

324
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:54,470
so can you can you think of any other at

325
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,240
really big crazy failures

326
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,210
like multibillion-dollar failures

327
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,529
because I can think of two the first one

328
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:06,139
was a failure of quality so this was a

329
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,090
massive product that instead of taking

330
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:11,570
three years to deliver to production

331
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,009
ended up taking six and they cut 80% of

332
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,379
the features they were trying to deliver

333
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,600
and their problem was technical debt and

334
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,610
that was Windows Vista and anybody that

335
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,549
used it when it first came out will have

336
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:26,090
felt some of that pain so that was a

337
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:28,460
quality issue and Microsoft worked very

338
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,830
hard to build up an engineering

339
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:35,539
excellence after that but the problem

340
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:37,279
was that they still didn't and they

341
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:39,080
still were building the right thing so

342
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,860
they ended up with a mismatch - customer

343
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:47,179
desires which was indeed Windows 8 which

344
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:50,570
was a massive mismatch to that idea so

345
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:53,419
it was after Windows 8 and that they

346
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:58,129
started focusing both on the engineering

347
00:21:53,419 --> 00:22:01,009
excellence and on the getting the right

348
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:03,139
features into production which means you

349
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:05,809
have to get tighter feedback loops which

350
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:06,399
is where Windows 10 was born and Windows

351
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,350
10

352
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:12,169
effectively from our perspective Windows

353
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,539
10 ships to production every 30 days but

354
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:16,879
from the team that writes on it four and

355
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,940
a half thousand engineers and they ship

356
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:22,159
to production daily the code that an

357
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,649
engineer writes today is running on the

358
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,879
CEOs laptop tomorrow everybody inside of

359
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:30,200
Microsoft gets the internal build and

360
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,879
they can choose to install their own

361
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,860
machine and then not get the built in

362
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,289
case anybody's on here that Microsoft

363
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,409
and knows there is a there is an escape

364
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:41,090
hatch if you don't like that but firfer

365
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:44,149
for the majority of people there they're

366
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,610
taking that at faster build and for

367
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:49,820
those of you in the know a machine I'm

368
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:53,990
on just now is in the Windows 10 insider

369
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:56,120
preview so I get weekly dev builds from

370
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,299
the Windows boot from the dev branch to

371
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,929
the windows team that that is there's a

372
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:05,269
17 million people that do that so it's a

373
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:08,240
lot of people catching the tires and I

374
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:10,280
think that's the important thing is

375
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,300
getting stuff into production as quickly

376
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:17,900
as possible

377
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:19,179
and so I think this idea of learning is

378
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,660
something that you're all familiar with

379
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:25,460
and I want to just posit some kind of

380
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,220
kind of problems and challenges that I

381
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,530
think and many people seem to have had

382
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,179
and I particularly like this one because

383
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,700
you do a front release and then you

384
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:38,330
either get a smiley face back or some

385
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,950
strange characters but usually well that

386
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,650
this being Scotland it would just be

387
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,840
swear words but in most of the world

388
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,900
it'd probably just be swear words anyway

389
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:57,490
and what is this pile of crap that

390
00:23:47,900 --> 00:24:00,320
you've I should I so the the three

391
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:05,500
things that I think posed this problem

392
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:09,400
and for for agility is what how and who

393
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:12,679
and if we break that down a little bit

394
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,130
the what challenges some of you will be

395
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:19,490
familiar with this data is from the

396
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,130
Standish Group and Boston that do the

397
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,600
chaos report and so no focus on on

398
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,080
product strategy and an effective

399
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,820
prioritization and I believe very few

400
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,740
organizations that say they're doing

401
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,320
agile actually have a prioritized

402
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,760
backlog so if you don't require this

403
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,710
backlog the engineers are just gonna

404
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:42,620
make up whatever it is that they they

405
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:44,179
want to do to work on it um those 65% of

406
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,450
the functionality that we build is not

407
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:48,620
used by our customers that's average you

408
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,270
could be worse or better

409
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,890
most people that think they're better

410
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,860
usually end up and worse when they look

411
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,970
at the data and 35% of your requirements

412
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,540
were change I'm sure you're familiar

413
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,210
with that figure as well and but weak

414
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,740
product owners poorly defined runs

415
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:09,350
responsibilities and product management

416
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:12,650
are key parts of that challenge so they

417
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,020
focus instead of focusing on a product

418
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,660
and making the right decisions for a

419
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:22,010
product they focus on time limited

420
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:24,020
short-term goals called projects

421
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,110
and those projects may or may not

422
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,330
provide benefit to the overall product

423
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,090
as the person running the project is not

424
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,820
measured generally by the overall

425
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,340
success of the product the measured by

426
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:40,850
the short-term success of the project

427
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:43,400
and in those worlds you tend to have a

428
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,130
long time to market can a long cycle

429
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,740
times I I would personally say anything

430
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,470
longer than 30 days time to market is

431
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,380
too long and there's another

432
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:58,190
organization that agrees with me I did a

433
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,180
presentation recently on detecting agile

434
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,400
[Â __Â ]

435
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,820
which is a Department of Defense article

436
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,120
you finding that did that last last week

437
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,440
people find that as well where I talk

438
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,850
about some of those issues I've got a

439
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:15,500
slide from it further on in the

440
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,620
presentation for you guys and the who

441
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,500
challenges who's doing the work and

442
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,290
apparently this is where we lose a lot

443
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,230
we lose 50 percent for ineffective

444
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:30,830
collaboration now I know many of you

445
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:33,860
work with teams that are trying their

446
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,930
best to be effective collaborators and

447
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,090
you're probably your number is probably

448
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:43,100
better than 50% an average across all

449
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:47,690
something like 70,000 IT projects

450
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:50,030
worldwide but that idea and you might

451
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,110
you might be not far off that 50%

452
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:55,130
depending on the way your organization

453
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,500
is is managed an effective servant

454
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,470
leadership that that idea of people

455
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,120
being managers instead of leaders inside

456
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:06,440
the organization is kind of key there

457
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:08,270
and is a big struggle and not having

458
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,840
good objectives you know that

459
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:14,480
misalignment of where we're going with

460
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,860
people's understanding of what it is is

461
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,600
is fairly fairly common and then we end

462
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,600
up with these hierarchies of

463
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,929
organizational structure that are based

464
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,900
on a hundred and thirty year old

465
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:33,000
terroristic practices that are really

466
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,890
out more deep for the modern modern

467
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:42,600
workplace subs the who there is also the

468
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:49,770
how in the how and we're really seeing

469
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:52,590
that growth of technical debt it's it's

470
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:55,640
systemic in our in our industry and even

471
00:27:52,590 --> 00:28:00,350
big companies like like Microsoft and

472
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:03,030
who whose job it is to build software

473
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,450
and end up with significant amounts of

474
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:09,240
technical debt I like to use data I'm

475
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,040
not sure if I have that data in here I

476
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,970
can get it for anybody who asks for it

477
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:18,030
and but I have data around and how many

478
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,530
features the azure DevOps team in

479
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,210
Microsoft was shipping to production

480
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,280
eight years ago when they were still a

481
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,410
waterfall team and how many features

482
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,270
they're shipping to production now when

483
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,429
they were a waterfall team mounting

484
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,190
technical debt only deploying once every

485
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,440
two years they were shipping about

486
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,910
twenty five features to production each

487
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,250
year that's with six hundred and fifty

488
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,169
people and with the same number of

489
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,540
people now having spent eight years

490
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,610
paying back their technical debt so

491
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,929
moving that needle from fighting the

492
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,410
technical debt struggling with

493
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:51,690
complexity towards adding new features

494
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:54,169
they now add more than two hundred and

495
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:57,059
seventy features to production each year

496
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:58,650
so that just shows if they were spending

497
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,110
90% of their time struggling with

498
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,900
complexity pay back that technical debt

499
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,610
and you get a lot more done because your

500
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,610
teams aren't struggling with that so

501
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:10,290
much and that's a that's a common growth

502
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,700
of technical debt is one of the the

503
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:15,840
biggest blockers to that so you really

504
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,580
need to focus on that from an

505
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,280
engineering perspective but also I

506
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,429
mentioned anything that's automated

507
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,960
sorry

508
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,380
anything that's manual you want to

509
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,820
automate everything so manual testing

510
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,679
manual environment provisioning manual

511
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,520
building integration manual deployment

512
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,410
manual anything is a problem I did work

513
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,100
with a team in

514
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:41,760
Athens that was using a product called

515
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,080
starting to do their stars control don't

516
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,840
get me started we've moved them off star

517
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,460
team but and one of the features of star

518
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,750
team is branching and merging as you

519
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,169
would expect from our source control

520
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,970
system but the team didn't know they

521
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:57,090
knew about branching but they didn't

522
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,850
know about marriage so there was a 30-30

523
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:02,160
i between 30 and 60 people in this

524
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,140
organization that when they wanted to

525
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,160
bring changes from a branch across to

526
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,230
the main line

527
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,809
they were manually copying and pasting

528
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,270
those changes across there are still

529
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:14,179
teams out there who don't understand

530
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:19,049
some of these fundamental concepts and

531
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:23,190
need to start focusing on anything this

532
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:25,110
manual is a bad idea if we take all of

533
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,409
that that data that we saw there for the

534
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:31,080
different different challenges the thing

535
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,990
I like is this little graph here if your

536
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:37,679
input was a hundred euros

537
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,020
what would your output be based on 35

538
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,750
percent of your time spent building the

539
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,400
right features so then we've only got 35

540
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:48,780
percent left so I'd have a hundred

541
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:52,070
that's 35 euros and if we lose 50

542
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:57,000
percent for collaboration we're down to

543
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:59,970
17 and a half euros out of 100 and if we

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,549
spend 30 percent of our time building

545
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:05,039
new features and 70 percent of our time

546
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:09,390
struggling with complexity we end up

547
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:12,870
spending 5 euros 25 on adding new

548
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:16,620
features and out of a hundred that

549
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:18,720
that's that's a horrendous ROI and but

550
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,350
it's the reality for many organizations

551
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:26,280
out there but just to put that in

552
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,230
perspective for a million pounds spend a

553
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:30,240
million pounds on a project that's fifty

554
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,110
two thousand five hundred pounds of

555
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,919
value that's that's just not not good

556
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:41,370
enough and that's not just engineering

557
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:45,299
that's business processes that's know

558
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:48,090
focus on collaboration these are these

559
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,980
are super super common industry-wide

560
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,539
I know some of your teams might be

561
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,940
better than that but you also work

562
00:31:51,539 --> 00:32:00,000
inside of wider organizations that may

563
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:03,570
still have some of those problem so we

564
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,080
want to be collaborative to be more

565
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:10,380
effective and that's why you know that's

566
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:14,520
why this little document exists the idea

567
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:17,279
of the agile manifesto was to try and

568
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,870
focus on the right things rather than

569
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,049
the wrong things that organizations have

570
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,520
been focusing on but it's still taking

571
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:27,230
taking time to get there

572
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:31,260
and one of the things that I see I know

573
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:33,419
this is the way we do things around here

574
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,029
is the common thing was it the cup

575
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:38,279
culture eats agility for breakfast our

576
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,929
culture meets changed for breakfast or

577
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,559
culture just eats everything for

578
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:47,100
breakfast that's part of that that

579
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,159
problem and so does this journey that

580
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,159
organizations undertake companies talk

581
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,890
about an agile transformation I don't

582
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,929
really like that phrase because

583
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:00,779
transformation implies some kind of

584
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:05,250
completion which i think is just

585
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,840
fundamentally not not true and I usually

586
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:10,500
think about it more as an agile

587
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,919
evolution as an organization you're

588
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,840
going to be constantly changing towards

589
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,399
an effectively an unknown goal and that

590
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,559
you can have an idea of where you would

591
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,230
like to go next where would you like to

592
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,730
go in the next few steps but ultimately

593
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:30,110
where you end up is going to be

594
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:33,600
somewhere different and I usually use

595
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:36,929
this kind of diagram I know the Snyder

596
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,600
model is not I'm not selling you on the

597
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:42,480
Snyder model for sure and it's just for

598
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,299
illustrative purposes that if we have

599
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,950
break our organization up into into

600
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,980
these kind of kind of sectors where

601
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,320
would you plot your company would your

602
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:56,179
company be in the more at controlling

603
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,730
space or in cultivating

604
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:02,029
people space is it based on competence

605
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,700
or collaboration what what percentage of

606
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:07,340
each of these would it be based on

607
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:11,240
there's no 100% anything but if your

608
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:14,240
organization was in a particular place

609
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,720
and you say you want to go somewhere

610
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,639
else it's not actually a straight path

611
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,530
like that it's more of our wibbly-wobbly

612
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:29,389
Road and I like to think of it as

613
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:32,240
orienteering you go off in a particular

614
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:33,740
direction you hit an obstacle you figure

615
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,649
out how to get round it and then you

616
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:41,419
figure out what's how do we reorient

617
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:43,609
take back to that important direction

618
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:45,500
that we're trying to get to and see

619
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:47,240
where we get to so it might not quite be

620
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,849
the same place you thought you were

621
00:34:47,240 --> 00:35:01,220
going to get to hopefully it would be a

622
00:34:51,849 --> 00:35:04,760
better a better place and so one of the

623
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:07,280
things that I think is really important

624
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,140
is you you can't I think I've said a lot

625
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,650
of important things and every

626
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:15,799
organization is is is unique you start

627
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,660
from a unique spot even if you use

628
00:35:15,799 --> 00:35:19,970
Schneider you start from a new unique

629
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,750
spot you end up in the unique spot and

630
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:29,049
however you want to do that everybody is

631
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:32,059
unique so the idea that you can take a

632
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:37,240
methodology that somebody else has built

633
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:41,329
and apply it to your organization is

634
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:43,609
really a fallacy as its it's not going

635
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,619
to work what works for you might not

636
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,299
work for another organization for what

637
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:50,349
works for them might not work for

638
00:35:47,299 --> 00:35:55,460
somebody else an experimentation and

639
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:58,130
iterating towards these ideas is really

640
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,410
important but that iteration towards

641
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,780
ideas that acceptance that our current

642
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:06,980
processes are imperfectly defined is

643
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:09,480
fundamentally it fundamentally means

644
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,880
that we can't just

645
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,460
use somebody else's process I have two

646
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,740
processes that I'm thinking of I'm sure

647
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,650
you're familiar with both of these and

648
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:22,740
one is safe

649
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,890
skill agile framework I know the newer

650
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:29,070
versions of safe my picture is v4 of

651
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:35,540
safe remember what they're on now there

652
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:40,050
may be as high as V but the ideas

653
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:42,750
original idea of safe was Dean didn't

654
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,119
living well implemented in an

655
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:49,470
organization how to do everything and

656
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:52,680
then documented it and published it as a

657
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:56,880
framework that folks could folks could

658
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,010
use and it quite often failed in in fact

659
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,869
mostly it failed in organizations that

660
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,490
it was implemented afterwards it might

661
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,320
have worked in the first organization

662
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,780
because that was custom-built for them

663
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,780
but then failed in future organizations

664
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,180
same with the Spotify model and the

665
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:16,109
Spotify model is not really a Spotify

666
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:18,060
model I mean the folks at Spotify would

667
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:21,210
kind of laugh if you said you

668
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,100
implemented the Spotify model because

669
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,340
what is written in that white paper is

670
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,230
not what those teams do today and the

671
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,420
white paper and the presentations that

672
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,290
the Spotify team did where a

673
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:39,750
point-in-time presentation a point in

674
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:41,520
time understanding of what what they

675
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,050
were doing at that point in time they've

676
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,690
moved on since then they've changed

677
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,220
their practices to suit what worked and

678
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,710
what didn't some of the practices that

679
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,240
are described in that white paper lasted

680
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,450
a couple of months some of them lasted a

681
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:59,640
couple of years some of them lasted five

682
00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:02,190
minutes it just depends what what things

683
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,970
make sense and I think that's the

684
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,430
important thing

685
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,800
because really is something I like to

686
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,440
say there's no such thing as best

687
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,430
practices only adequate practices for

688
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,830
the situation at hand and there's

689
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:19,230
there's no guarantees everything's going

690
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,480
to be different and I really enjoyed I

691
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,410
don't know if anybody saw

692
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:30,089
if anybody's read and the the Department

693
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:32,910
of Defense how to detect agile BS but

694
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:35,760
it's an article that was written a white

695
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,680
paper sent out to all of the procurement

696
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,380
officers within the Department of

697
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,190
Defense to help them figure out whether

698
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,589
their vendors are actually telling them

699
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,619
the truth about being agile or they're

700
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:51,510
just saying they're agile because you

701
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,589
know that's the thing you have to say

702
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:58,290
now in order to get the contract and

703
00:38:54,589 --> 00:39:03,839
something happened recently those that

704
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:07,490
those that know and might have seen this

705
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:11,520
already but I have a little US Air Force

706
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:14,160
I have the original memorandum that came

707
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:20,640
with this this was a clarification of

708
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:24,050
that that memo and I'm the the CSO I

709
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,970
can't remember what CSO stands for chief

710
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:32,220
something officer I can't remember

711
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:35,490
anyway the the senior officer in charge

712
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:40,050
of IT and for the US Air Force is quite

713
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:44,000
a progressive thinker and and he likens

714
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:47,010
safe to waterfowl it's a large bloated

715
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,220
prescriptive framework that tells you

716
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:54,000
how to go do something and you won't

717
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:57,270
find any large successful commercial

718
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,720
organizations doing anything that looks

719
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:03,060
like safe they've all built their own

720
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,859
custom process based on the way they do

721
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,260
things now I'm not saying that safe

722
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:10,170
doesn't have value I think it does have

723
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,200
value in certain circumstances and if

724
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:16,050
you see the like the fifth bullet point

725
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,790
down safe might be potentially might

726
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:21,060
potentially be used a useful framework

727
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:23,609
for teams who do not use DevOps

728
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,109
but a key principle of DevOps is to

729
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:27,270
decouple work in teams and only

730
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:28,770
synchronization required about donors

731
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,839
bhagavad I mean that's not quite right

732
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:33,480
but know what I mean and that idea of

733
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,260
having that monolithic process I

734
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,140
think really really works and that said

735
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,240
lots of organizations that are not yet

736
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,420
ready for DevOps not yet ready for true

737
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,500
agility um get a little way of the way

738
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,680
there but I think there's definitely uh

739
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,740
what's it called when you you think

740
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,830
you're you're there but you're not there

741
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,500
there's a false sense of security maybe

742
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:04,560
mmm I'm not sure what the word is and

743
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,440
but you have this false sense they

744
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,400
you're you're doing something agile when

745
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,500
you're using safe when safe is in fact

746
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,850
the complete antagonistic opposite of

747
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,090
agility

748
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,369
it's a prescriptive framework and I know

749
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:22,470
that new versions of safe are less

750
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:24,990
prescriptive but that's its source

751
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:28,650
that's its routes and you may as well be

752
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:31,170
doing PMI prints two versions of agility

753
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,300
and provide the same benefit I think

754
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:36,720
start from something that works a little

755
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,310
bit a little bit better so hopefully

756
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,580
everybody's read there's this idea of

757
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:44,160
five dysfunctions of a team it's an

758
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,200
awesome awesome book and I have that

759
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,600
presentation on detecting agile BS that

760
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,680
was into a little bit of that but the

761
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:56,070
thing that we tend to do in

762
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,340
organizations is we we we have this

763
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:02,369
complex world and I think however

764
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:05,340
however you-you-you understand it I

765
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:08,010
think this is the idea of software

766
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,490
development being product development

767
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:13,710
rather than product delivery you know a

768
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:16,980
car production line is product delivery

769
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:19,200
Toyota developed the the lean Toyota

770
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,410
Production system in order to deliver

771
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,260
cars not design cars the design team for

772
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,340
Toyota don't use the name Toyota

773
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,859
Production system because it's a

774
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,859
different sort of work in the software

775
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:35,130
world which I am that's my background

776
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,160
our production line is our DevOps

777
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,140
pipeline that's our from the time a

778
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,990
developer commits codes to the

779
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,210
repository till it gets into production

780
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:48,300
that's our production light or

781
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,400
everything before that the writing of

782
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,980
the code the merging everything together

783
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,760
those are those are creative endeavors

784
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,650
that sit in this complex world of more

785
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,330
is unpredictable than predictable with

786
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,890
emergent answers and many competing

787
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,140
ideas I'm sure you've you've seen these

788
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,720
before I know I've talked to Satpal

789
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,349
about these quite often but

790
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,099
organizations tend to use a different

791
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:17,220
management style the leaders job they

792
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,080
tend to use is best practice you know I

793
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,430
hear that all the time in organizations

794
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,780
this idea of best practices and

795
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,940
establishing patterns and optimizing to

796
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,560
them and you wouldn't believe the number

797
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,740
of organizations that still have a

798
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,830
command and control at hierarchical

799
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,910
outlook to the world it's it's very

800
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:42,950
difficult to get to get em organizations

801
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:46,140
to treat complex work like complex work

802
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:48,180
so in a complex environment you're

803
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,670
supposed to create a bounded environment

804
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,380
for action so we want to have some

805
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,480
boundaries so everybody's going in the

806
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,160
same direction but inside of those

807
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,070
boundaries we don't really know how to

808
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,550
solve the problem and so we need folks

809
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:04,230
to kind of get there themselves and

810
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,060
obviously we want to increase

811
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,470
communication because we're talking to

812
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,540
each other more we come up with better

813
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,220
ideas

814
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,930
so generating those ideas servant

815
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,790
leadership obviously to get things out

816
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,470
of the way for those people to be able

817
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:18,599
to do the work and do it effectively

818
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:22,230
create an environment for that to work

819
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:25,160
and so we need to start somewhere and

820
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:28,619
where we need to start and is probably

821
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,710
some kind of loose framework and my

822
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:33,990
background is a scrum I'm not opposed to

823
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,720
replacing every time I mentioned the

824
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,089
word scrum with Kanban I'm just using

825
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,390
this for illustrative purposes again and

826
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:44,599
I like scrum I like scrum with Kanban I

827
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,609
teach the professional scrum with Kanban

828
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,869
class from scrum dark I'm co-teaching

829
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:51,450
with Daniel Vacanti

830
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,950
we're gonna do an online class Ferb well

831
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,080
it was supposed to be an in-person class

832
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,300
in Edinburgh but obviously it's going to

833
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,470
be virtual

834
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,660
but I'm going to be teaching with Daniel

835
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,510
Vacanti in a couple of months and we're

836
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:08,130
going to dive into how do we take those

837
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:10,680
and complimentary Kanban ideas the core

838
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:12,720
practices of Kanban and apply them into

839
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,400
the the scrum world and so I don't think

840
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,710
I mentioned that in this presentation

841
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:22,860
but it's pretty good you can go and get

842
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:27,960
the cat the Kanban guide for scrum teams

843
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:30,510
which is a free website so we have this

844
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,240
idea of potentially using some kind of

845
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:35,940
framework I'm using the scrum framework

846
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,700
for a product inside an organization so

847
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,040
we maybe have one team working against

848
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,380
this product and and instead of being

849
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,490
part of the hierarchy they kind of

850
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:52,620
exists within a separate bubble I've

851
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:55,170
seen this done in organizations where

852
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,090
they've actually created a separate

853
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,740
company for the engineering teams to

854
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,130
work in so they can work in a different

855
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,080
way

856
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,280
i with the hierarchy of the rest of the

857
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:10,050
organization and I've seen this done in

858
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,240
KLM where they created a studio for that

859
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,340
work to happen and move the software and

860
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,840
so for teams into that and it used

861
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,180
services from the rest of the

862
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:23,280
organization so those shared services

863
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:25,320
might be infrastructure QA might be HR

864
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,600
might be any of those those things

865
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,550
outside of that and so you basically get

866
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,130
a small pocket of scrum inside your

867
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,440
organization a lot of organizations try

868
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:36,270
to do a massive transformation they

869
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,610
maybe do a small pilot project and a

870
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:40,950
massive transformation and generally

871
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:43,290
those fail usually they end up at

872
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,850
something using something like safe

873
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,190
because they need to figure out how to

874
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,030
do everything all at once and that just

875
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,870
tells you that

876
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,390
so this scrum framework is just a - I

877
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:57,720
mean the the scrum is just a tool to

878
00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:00,450
help us create an empirical process

879
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,900
control system within which we can

880
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:06,140
inspect and adapt towards creating a

881
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,089
more optimal system

882
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,319
that's really what is designed for some

883
00:47:08,089 --> 00:47:16,069
famous Kanban except a little bit more

884
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:18,049
make sense so do scrum well or do cab

885
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:22,549
Manuel is your first step

886
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:26,690
am i I do it well I mean that people are

887
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:30,980
really not good it even doing scrum at

888
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:32,240
all or doing Kanban at all I got two

889
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,890
teams all the time who say they're doing

890
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,079
Kanban and then you know they've just

891
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:39,260
got bored with stickies that move across

892
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:43,069
it that's not Kanban where your whip

893
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:46,069
limits where your your concrete

894
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,900
processes where are they not decided any

895
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:49,760
of those things so some interesting data

896
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:52,960
here which is actually from Forrester

897
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,859
Research and is only 22% of

898
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,170
organizations that say they've adopted

899
00:47:54,859 --> 00:48:00,140
agile and are actually doing short

900
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,859
iterations if you're not doing short

901
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,920
iterations

902
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:06,740
you're not very agile only 13% do

903
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,920
retrospectives if you're not inspecting

904
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:13,130
and adapting what what are you doing and

905
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,819
only 16% of prioritized backlogs though

906
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:20,240
these are appalling numbers that are

907
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:22,460
that are only only getting getting worse

908
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,059
as more organizations move towards

909
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,769
agility and more snake oil salesmen and

910
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:29,630
charlatans convinced them to do the

911
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:33,819
wrong thing and I actually worked with

912
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:38,390
some some folks in organizations and the

913
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:41,420
their organization is sold unsafe so

914
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:44,210
they create something that they can sell

915
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,369
is safe but it's actually much more

916
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,700
agile than say if it's a custom process

917
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:50,890
for them so some organizations that say

918
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,480
they're doing safe actually aren't

919
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:56,539
they're doing their own thing and that's

920
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,059
okay I'm okay with that

921
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:03,019
just some extra data if we fix these

922
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:06,380
problems we can improve a lot of things

923
00:49:03,019 --> 00:49:09,680
in our organization and try not have

924
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:13,069
just skin deep I like that expression

925
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,759
skin deep agile I think Ken and Jeff

926
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:16,910
call it flaccid agile I like that one as

927
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:18,720
well

928
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:20,849
I usually call it

929
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,010
mechanical I call it mechanical scrum

930
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:24,710
we're just mechanically following it

931
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:30,330
we're not actually doing the things

932
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:33,300
those are pretty effective so step two

933
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,940
is you need to enhance it you need to do

934
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,520
those things like create empirical

935
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,220
systems have our engineering practices

936
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,510
coding guidelines user experience

937
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,340
emergent architecture all of those

938
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,869
things and and once we've got good

939
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,400
engineering practices for me that's the

940
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:49,200
engineering practices parts you get

941
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:53,550
mechanical scrum engineering practices

942
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:56,250
and then introduce the values behind the

943
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,800
processes how do you build a system

944
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:02,010
within which you can have transparency

945
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,530
that you see the truth and these are

946
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,150
trying to trying to create that and so

947
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:09,240
whatever your you're doing you need to

948
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,000
focus on all of those things to get to

949
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,859
this idea of doing something

950
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,320
professionally rather than just doing

951
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:19,230
something and I think that's that's the

952
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,450
fault are in many organizations is they

953
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,670
don't focus on professional scrum

954
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:26,250
because we don't have time to do testing

955
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,720
let's just get stuff done or we don't

956
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:30,390
have time whatever the things we don't

957
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,490
have time for to focus on that

958
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:36,680
professionalism and then we end up with

959
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:40,410
with some kind of small loose framework

960
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,990
around which we can build our own custom

961
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:45,540
processes that's the idea I'm looking at

962
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,790
so we can then add multiple teams into

963
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,440
this bubble and that all work by

964
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,290
different rules use these shared

965
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,109
services and we've upskilled the

966
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:59,880
individual teams because the reality is

967
00:50:55,109 --> 00:51:01,770
that skilled teams are 224 percent more

968
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,320
likely to be successful than unskilled

969
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:06,990
teams that seems like it makes common

970
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,570
sense but it doesn't necessarily make

971
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:11,609
common sense and a lot of organizations

972
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:15,630
they believe that scrum or Kanban is

973
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:18,540
just this unicorn that's able to solve

974
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:20,640
all of their problems and but it ends up

975
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,430
being you've heard the term scrum er

976
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,790
fall or many waterfalls and everything

977
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:31,820
ends up being a bit of a car crash

978
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:34,670
that's our very common thing I actually

979
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:38,630
do have the the Kanban stuff in here

980
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:40,970
they're mate and so one thing that I

981
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,880
always get teams to do once they get to

982
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:47,060
that professional scrum level is they

983
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,660
need to start looking at their floor and

984
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,720
optimizing for it folks on the call who

985
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:55,910
are agile practitioners who work in

986
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,740
these big organizations you'll know what

987
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:59,270
I'm talking about if you take a bunch of

988
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,040
amateur teams and try and get them to

989
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,750
look at their floor it's an even bigger

990
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,500
car crash you have to get professional

991
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:09,500
teams first get them all all going in

992
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:12,680
the same direction delivering a working

993
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:15,170
increment every iteration once you can

994
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:18,860
get there start introducing flow start

995
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:21,290
optimizing for smaller batches and focus

996
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:24,740
on that idea and I mentioned the

997
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:26,510
professional scrum Kanban the command

998
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,930
guide for scrum teams and it talks about

999
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:32,510
the five core practices visualize

1000
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,670
limiting work-in-progress actively

1001
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:37,490
manage items make polls explicit and it

1002
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,960
proved collaboratively and those are the

1003
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,510
core varieties from camera and so I'm

1004
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,580
not talking about the Kanban method

1005
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:47,480
which is from lku I'm just talking about

1006
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:50,540
those those core Kanban practices and

1007
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:53,800
something that can said recently was the

1008
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,700
the only foundation to scale is

1009
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,280
professional teams you need to get the

1010
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,670
professional teams first before you can

1011
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:04,070
scale and I'm sure you've seen a bunch

1012
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:06,700
of unprofessional teams shoved together

1013
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:09,950
and trying to build some software it's

1014
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,230
always an amusing car crash and but

1015
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:14,330
Steve Porter who was one of the

1016
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:17,390
co-creators of the Kanban guide for

1017
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,070
scrum teams added that manage flow the

1018
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,590
only foundation for skill is

1019
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:25,160
professional teams that manage flow

1020
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:27,250
because the reality is of scaling is

1021
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:30,920
expensive it's hard it's wasteful

1022
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:33,380
ultimately don't scale scaling it is an

1023
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:37,349
anti-pattern of software development you

1024
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:42,180
need to avoid it at all costs

1025
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:46,799
because scaling doesn't go linearly it

1026
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:49,319
has this very quick tail off as you add

1027
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,789
more people and then at some point you

1028
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:52,829
add enough people that it gets too

1029
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:57,229
complicated and you end up with

1030
00:53:52,829 --> 00:54:01,949
something that is just not a lot of fun

1031
00:53:57,229 --> 00:54:04,140
this is I think this is our P I planning

1032
00:54:01,949 --> 00:54:08,430
yeah this is the last P I plus the video

1033
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:10,349
from the last pipelining that I saw so

1034
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:13,529
you can scale continuously

1035
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:15,569
as long as you do certain things and but

1036
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:18,589
you need to do them all the time you

1037
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:21,390
need to identify and remove impediments

1038
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:24,359
i--sorry dependencies dependencies are

1039
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:27,900
going to be your killer so anytime you

1040
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:29,819
can create vertical slices so feature

1041
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,880
teams rather than horizontal teams

1042
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:34,619
obviously and but integrating work all

1043
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,829
the time across all levels one of the

1044
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:40,349
downfalls of office at 2012 was that

1045
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:42,839
they weren't integrating every iteration

1046
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:44,670
they had most of their stuff integrated

1047
00:54:42,839 --> 00:54:48,180
but not everything so then they ended up

1048
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:52,410
nine months later with a big problem and

1049
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:56,219
then create and inspect those increments

1050
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:59,400
regularly obviously make sure your teams

1051
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:02,459
have the tools and skills necessary to

1052
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,829
do things at scale it's going to take

1053
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:09,119
more tools it's going to take that more

1054
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:11,069
time it's going to be harder to beat to

1055
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,109
get get up get on board with that and

1056
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:17,390
obviously keep keep inspecting and

1057
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:20,430
adapting frequency frequently scrum dark

1058
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:23,999
noticed that this scaling thing was a

1059
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:26,999
problem they were very late to the

1060
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:29,190
scaling framework party and the reason

1061
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:31,680
for that was they wanted to take their

1062
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:37,259
time and make sure that they had

1063
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:41,130
something the in keeping with scrum is

1064
00:55:37,259 --> 00:55:42,989
the absolute minimum you need to make

1065
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,239
sure you maintain the levels of

1066
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:47,819
communication that you need to create an

1067
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,049
empirical process control system so they

1068
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:50,530
came up with something called the the

1069
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:52,660
nexus framework

1070
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,490
which is a lot smaller than a lot of the

1071
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:57,670
other frameworks that are out there um

1072
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:59,710
I'm thinking of a scrum at scale I'm

1073
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:01,060
thinking of safe I'm thinking of other

1074
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,710
frameworks because it's not going to

1075
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:07,349
tell you how to go solve your problems

1076
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:10,570
it's just going to deal with those

1077
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:14,859
communication issues between teams and

1078
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,720
I've seen Nexus and I've seen Nexus

1079
00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:20,170
implemented quite a few times with

1080
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,000
organizations and it's very easy and

1081
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,070
quick for people to understand because

1082
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,530
it's only a little bit more than scrum

1083
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:31,720
and it doesn't add a huge amount of

1084
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:35,170
complexity or overhead you've

1085
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,420
effectively got this idea of um you know

1086
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:39,670
you you're gonna have to do refinement

1087
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,080
now whereas if you get one scrum team

1088
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,990
with three people you maybe don't have

1089
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:46,240
to refine but if you've got nine scrum

1090
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:49,000
teams of 10 people working together men

1091
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:53,050
and you're gonna have to make sure you

1092
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,450
have all of your backlogs in a good

1093
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:58,119
state and then you need little teams of

1094
00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:00,640
teams to get together to make sure that

1095
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:02,530
you have good communication so you can

1096
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,810
see the Nexus sprint planning has a

1097
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,580
little Nexus that gets together it's a

1098
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:09,910
team of teams it's the right people

1099
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:11,680
opens our open space rules and from the

1100
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,540
scrum teams that get together to figure

1101
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,130
out some dependencies to figure out how

1102
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,650
we're going to move forward for the next

1103
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,599
sprint and take it back to the rest of

1104
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:22,359
the scrum teams which may or may not be

1105
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:25,060
in the same time zone it's okay to have

1106
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:27,760
multiple as long as the individual

1107
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:29,890
members of your team are on the same

1108
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,740
team on in the same time zone in the

1109
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:34,859
same cool ok they don't have to be

1110
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:37,180
co-located but it's more optimal then

1111
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:39,160
more optimal is having those teams

1112
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,020
together and then multiple teams in

1113
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:45,010
multiple locations or in the world can

1114
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:48,190
work together so I asked Nexus sprint

1115
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:51,040
planning might run over 24 hours because

1116
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:53,440
you've got that time lag we just need to

1117
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,420
deal with that problem we need to figure

1118
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,730
out how to do that obviously the closer

1119
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:00,490
people are the better but there's the

1120
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,440
realities of business and and then we

1121
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,880
need a view on all of our work so the

1122
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,099
Nexus sprint backlog

1123
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,799
with a way to view individual teams

1124
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:10,630
backlogs we only have one review because

1125
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:13,660
we've got one product I think that's

1126
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:15,910
important but even on a daily basis we

1127
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,680
maybe have that team of teams get

1128
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:20,739
together to discuss dependencies and

1129
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,900
issues and then at the at the whole

1130
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:25,420
Nexus level and then take that back to

1131
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,789
the team's daily scrums again just a

1132
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,130
15-minute before everybody else's daily

1133
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:32,559
scrum representatives that make sense

1134
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:35,019
from the other teams get together figure

1135
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,849
it out take that information back same

1136
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:38,859
in the retrospective you're going to

1137
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:39,849
have but you're gonna have kind of

1138
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:41,680
you're gonna have to one of the

1139
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,940
beginning one at the end because you

1140
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,470
might have a bunch of things that need

1141
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,180
to be input into the team's

1142
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:48,069
retrospectives and then the teams might

1143
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,319
come up with all sorts of clever ideas

1144
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:52,960
to go solve those things so that team of

1145
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:55,329
teams gets together to bring all that

1146
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,519
information back that's the idea from

1147
00:58:55,329 --> 00:58:59,229
Nexus it's just meant to be the minimum

1148
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:03,279
I'm not saying it's the right framework

1149
00:58:59,229 --> 00:59:06,249
for you but it can be a useful a useful

1150
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:09,460
tool that has those very simple added

1151
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:11,559
extras to help you get that increment at

1152
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,559
the end I didn't mention the Nexus

1153
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:17,979
integration team because it tends to be

1154
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:21,339
a very poorly understood the integration

1155
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:24,729
team is not your DevOps team it's not

1156
00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:26,589
your build team it's a team of teams

1157
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:29,950
it's a group of people who get together

1158
00:59:26,589 --> 00:59:31,960
to solve whatever problem is inhabiting

1159
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:34,029
the team's ability to get a working

1160
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,229
increment there's no point in the scrum

1161
00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:37,630
masters getting together

1162
00:59:35,229 --> 00:59:38,769
if the problem is merging code they're

1163
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:41,499
not going to know how to solve that

1164
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:44,200
problem you need the right people so

1165
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:46,719
effectively a nexus integration team is

1166
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,670
just representative some various teams

1167
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,940
the right people maybe they're scrum

1168
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:53,650
masters maybe they're engineers it just

1169
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,630
depends on what the problem is they're

1170
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:58,210
trying to solve it's not a permanent

1171
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:01,180
team they're gonna go back and the teams

1172
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:03,969
the individual scrum teams inside the

1173
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:07,539
Nexus to the do the work that's the idea

1174
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:10,479
behind Nexus and having these breaking

1175
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:15,279
teams so then we can bring in a much

1176
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:17,109
larger product into our story and you've

1177
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:17,650
got lots of little small products use no

1178
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:19,720
service

1179
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:22,749
overseas and then we bring in a larger

1180
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,749
product into that into that world so as

1181
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:27,730
more than three teams working together I

1182
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:29,999
don't know where that animation came

1183
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:33,099
from never mind

1184
01:00:29,999 --> 01:00:37,150
so that that essence of scaling is we

1185
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:38,829
need to anticipate problems by focusing

1186
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:42,099
on minimizing dependencies that's your

1187
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:45,789
your your almost most expensive concern

1188
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:48,910
is minimize dependencies and then make

1189
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:51,249
working software you're still a team of

1190
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:53,380
people working together to make a single

1191
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:56,549
product so if you don't have a working

1192
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:59,200
increment at the end of every iteration

1193
01:00:56,549 --> 01:01:01,720
we're not there yet we need to get that

1194
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:04,180
working integration so just inspecting

1195
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:06,009
and adapting towards that world and

1196
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:09,700
you're probably talking about more

1197
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:12,339
engineering practices for absolute focus

1198
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:14,349
on minimizing technical debt automated

1199
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:18,359
testing continuous build and delivery

1200
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:22,079
very very very important

1201
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:25,960
some examples of teams that are using

1202
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:29,680
Nexus Capital One has delivered some

1203
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,329
products with Nexus and I like the

1204
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,819
comment they are to less than an hour to

1205
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:36,099
explain access to teams that are already

1206
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:39,519
familiar with scrum it's not much more

1207
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:45,660
than scrum so Capital One Kathy Pacific

1208
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:51,730
Airlines and also use Nexus as well and

1209
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:54,099
that that really helps so while I'm I

1210
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:56,739
think this is a very miss Atwell I think

1211
01:01:54,099 --> 01:01:58,809
this is a misleading quote but small

1212
01:01:56,739 --> 01:02:01,599
teams of 32% relate to succeed large

1213
01:01:58,809 --> 01:02:05,019
projects are 600% and that's because

1214
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,779
large projects are such a big mass that

1215
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:11,259
they can get 600 percent improvement and

1216
01:02:07,779 --> 01:02:14,079
they probably both get a similar

1217
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:16,329
improvement is just much more obvious in

1218
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,269
a large project and I think small

1219
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:22,269
project here is 50 people or less large

1220
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:26,650
project is more than 50 people Gail's

1221
01:02:22,269 --> 01:02:31,450
reports that but what that is and so we

1222
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:35,500
we came up with this kind of bubble

1223
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:38,350
just back to my bubble of scrum in my

1224
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,580
case or bubble of Kanban or even you

1225
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:40,960
could have one team doing can add

1226
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,700
another one doing scrum it doesn't

1227
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,740
matter you know these shared services

1228
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,380
there's bubble in which people work

1229
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:50,050
differently and and potentially you need

1230
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,580
to at some point you're gonna have

1231
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,640
enough going on in there

1232
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:56,920
that you need to start focusing on that

1233
01:02:53,640 --> 01:03:00,270
leadership ideas and and that's where

1234
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:04,150
you start to look at how do we get the

1235
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:07,930
CEO CIO involved in that and provide

1236
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:10,510
agile functions of leadership like HR

1237
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:13,720
finance and admin there are things that

1238
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:15,430
the whole team can use in an agile

1239
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,320
fashion rather than just using the

1240
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:19,930
shared services from other projects um

1241
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,510
how do you build this new type of

1242
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:24,970
organization that is flatter structure

1243
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:27,490
or not based on hierarchy and inside of

1244
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:30,870
that and then this idea of bringing in

1245
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:34,930
more products you might have some bigger

1246
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:36,160
products that have multiple Nexus again

1247
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:38,950
the windows team has four and a half

1248
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:43,270
thousand people working on it and the

1249
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:44,740
office I think has 300 scrum teams 300

1250
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,970
scrum teams now they've come up with

1251
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,910
their own way to solve that problem

1252
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:50,890
that's okay too this is just a framework

1253
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:54,970
that you could use to help you get

1254
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:57,880
started but it's it's interesting to

1255
01:03:54,970 --> 01:04:01,210
note the the characteristics that I'm

1256
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,100
showing here are things that these big

1257
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:05,440
organizations that are doing agile well

1258
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,710
whatever they call those things or how

1259
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,710
they implement them they have something

1260
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:13,570
that kind of fits this bill and and the

1261
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:16,420
next thing we need to understand is how

1262
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:17,890
do we know it's all working so something

1263
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:19,420
that I think is very important is

1264
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:21,390
understanding whether you're making

1265
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,710
improvements the organization

1266
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:26,350
organizations spend a lot of money with

1267
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:27,790
us agile practitioners to come in and

1268
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:30,100
help them get better at delivering

1269
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:32,350
software how do we know we're making

1270
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:38,230
things better well we need some kind of

1271
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:42,120
metrics to monitor scrum that arc has

1272
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:44,220
some example metrics and I'm really

1273
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:47,760
stressing that super

1274
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:50,340
a heavily example metrics in particular

1275
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,650
categories but I think the categories

1276
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,540
are the thing that's important we've got

1277
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:57,060
to look forward to towards the future

1278
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,880
with market value let's you get the

1279
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:01,619
current value you've delivered in your

1280
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,930
product and how you monitor and measure

1281
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:05,609
that so you're gonna need some metrics

1282
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:08,010
around current value how do we

1283
01:05:05,609 --> 01:05:11,340
understand that and then we've got

1284
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:14,340
unrealized value value we don't know

1285
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:16,619
that we need to have yet how do you look

1286
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:19,160
at the market how do you look at market

1287
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:22,050
trends and analysis and figure that out

1288
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:26,550
build that into ability to innovate how

1289
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:28,320
quickly can we innovate how much time

1290
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:30,750
will we spend innovating in our product

1291
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,790
so we need some metrics of own around

1292
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:34,590
our innovation so I might be capex

1293
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:36,750
darzee's our pecs is a super simple one

1294
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:38,190
but I think it gets cloudy you're gonna

1295
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,230
need some other measures in there and

1296
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:42,570
then time to market how quickly can we

1297
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:44,609
actually get our product in front of

1298
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:47,099
users and I'll use the example of the

1299
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:49,109
windows team again which gets their

1300
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:52,440
software every thirty days in front of

1301
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:55,950
600 I think it's is it not a billion

1302
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:57,450
machines now yeah it was used to be six

1303
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:00,570
hundred million machines it's closer to

1304
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:02,670
a billion machines now worldwide that's

1305
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:05,070
pretty impressive engineering practices

1306
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:07,109
to get there I don't know why that

1307
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:09,690
animations coming in I have some example

1308
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:12,089
measures in the deck I'm not going to go

1309
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:15,570
through them all and I'll just flick

1310
01:06:12,089 --> 01:06:18,150
across but you've got to figure out

1311
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:19,680
leading and lagging indicators some of

1312
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,050
them are more important than others and

1313
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,660
these are just examples they might not

1314
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:26,430
work for your organization I don't know

1315
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:28,619
why there's animation again and it's

1316
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:33,420
doing it on all of them but unrealized

1317
01:06:28,619 --> 01:06:35,970
value time to market so even um cycle

1318
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:38,730
time release frequency leak time these

1319
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:40,980
are a lagging indicators there are there

1320
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:42,180
are leading indicators frequency of

1321
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:45,109
build success might be a leading

1322
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:50,570
indicator make sure you've got

1323
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:53,460
understand your measures effectively and

1324
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,599
innovation rate installed version index

1325
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,040
is a good one if you have a desktop

1326
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,680
product what percentage of your

1327
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,170
customers are

1328
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,690
the latest version of your product and I

1329
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:04,569
think that's a good indication of how

1330
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:06,880
versatile your organization or your

1331
01:07:04,569 --> 01:07:08,050
product is at getting getting out people

1332
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,670
aren't taking new versions there's

1333
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:11,290
probably something wrong is probably

1334
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:13,300
technical debt it's probably hard to

1335
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:15,700
install hard to support how hard to

1336
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:21,280
bring people out to speak all kinds of

1337
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:24,250
things like that so those are just

1338
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:26,050
example metrics if you're gonna collect

1339
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,540
some metrics just get started

1340
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:31,359
don't worry about getting too detailed

1341
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,670
collects the metrics monitor the data

1342
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,880
and see if you're improving things or

1343
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:39,280
not within your organization and I use

1344
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:43,390
some of the metrics here with customers

1345
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:46,450
I work with and and we monitor that data

1346
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:49,089
to make sure that when we make changes

1347
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,770
they're actually adding value and it's

1348
01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:52,900
okay to make changes and they don't add

1349
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:54,819
value we'll just stop that change we'll

1350
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,800
stop doing that thing but we need to

1351
01:07:54,819 --> 01:07:58,630
know that it's making a difference and

1352
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,290
the only way you can do that is with

1353
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:03,960
concrete measures and this time EBM

1354
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:07,720
metrics evidence based management

1355
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:09,640
EVM is something that actually comes out

1356
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,440
of the medical profession about a

1357
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,599
hundred years ago or actually a hundred

1358
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,099
and twenty ish years ago the medical

1359
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,870
profession decided that it would be a

1360
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:21,520
good idea to makes decisions on your

1361
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:26,230
health based on you know data like your

1362
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:28,359
blood pressure and you know collecting

1363
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,549
some data and figuring out how to solve

1364
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:33,310
your problem rather than just making up

1365
01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:35,109
an idea and hoping it works so this

1366
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:38,980
evidence-based management is for

1367
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:42,400
managers and organizational leaders to

1368
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:44,380
look at actual data make changes see how

1369
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,690
those changes impact the data are we

1370
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:49,420
taking the organization in right

1371
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:52,330
direction like project cost per

1372
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:54,069
iteration time to market innovation rate

1373
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:56,759
how much time do we spend innovating

1374
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:58,660
there see struggling with complexity

1375
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:00,969
satisfaction of our customers and

1376
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:04,029
employees is that trending up or is it

1377
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:06,010
trending down product revenue and costs

1378
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:08,590
these are all things that are

1379
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:11,020
measures of organizational and product

1380
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:12,730
performance and and we want to be

1381
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:14,140
optimizing those things we want to

1382
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:16,420
making those numbers look a bit a little

1383
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:21,610
bit better and we can tell whether we're

1384
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:23,170
making headway if we have balance across

1385
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:25,090
all of those things that's why I had

1386
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:29,770
four different categories of metrics

1387
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:31,750
because we could have asked awesome time

1388
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:33,580
to market but we're delivering a bunch

1389
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,100
of crap to our customers so we need to

1390
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:40,780
make sure and that we balance all of

1391
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:44,560
that out yeah

1392
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:47,320
just keep things simple and while my

1393
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,410
diagram might look super complicated now

1394
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:56,050
you saw it's literally just it's just

1395
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:58,170
scrum are we to scale scrum very simply

1396
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:01,540
and then a way to to measure it and

1397
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:05,440
that's really the idea the SDK in there

1398
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:06,780
is just and let's share some data so

1399
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,940
it's probably a community of practice

1400
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:12,220
across all of our teams to help share

1401
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:17,290
some of those good ideas and maybe

1402
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:19,660
create a starter pack for any new team

1403
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:22,450
starting up where should they start

1404
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:25,930
within the context of this organization

1405
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:29,020
so every company will build something

1406
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:32,020
different and frameworks are just a

1407
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:34,210
starting point and it's okay for them to

1408
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,580
start with Kanban start with scrum and

1409
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:43,470
start with and whatever whatever makes

1410
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:46,830
sense for them I had just some final

1411
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:50,590
suggestions where is it there yep and

1412
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:52,390
make sure you measure and focus on value

1413
01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:56,140
and outcomes rather than output and

1414
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:58,450
progress and we can output a lot of crap

1415
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:02,590
and not get to the outcomes that our

1416
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:06,640
organization needs to get to celebrate

1417
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:09,310
success improve the results get create a

1418
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,440
holistic view of what you're doing and

1419
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:15,400
try and improve those measures come up

1420
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,860
with a hypothesis measures move figure

1421
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,670
out if you're doing the right thing

1422
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,620
maximize

1423
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:21,910
learning and really just do the best you

1424
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:24,760
can

1425
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:26,590
I think Scott had a good comment is

1426
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,429
sometimes you'll try something and

1427
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:31,989
you'll just be wrong and that's okay we

1428
01:11:30,429 --> 01:11:34,570
need to do the best we can with the

1429
01:11:31,989 --> 01:11:41,290
information we have and see where we get

1430
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:46,420
to that was kind of what I wanted to

1431
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:48,730
cover and so just say I covered a bunch

1432
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:50,679
of stuff around scrum engineering

1433
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:53,590
excellence with the Kanban guide

1434
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:56,260
next is framework so don't scale pretty

1435
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:59,260
much is my advice and really I've

1436
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:01,630
already at all costs if you can and then

1437
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:04,480
evidence-based management actually make

1438
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:07,840
sure you look at data and you can get a

1439
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:10,770
copy of the slides from that link at the

1440
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:15,960
bottom and that's already been published

1441
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:23,199
for you and I guess we move over to

1442
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:26,230
questions yeah we'll take questions

1443
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:30,489
I've got a type was I talking to him

1444
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:35,410
about any country no no no we don't any

1445
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:36,790
come with chat so yeah if there are

1446
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:43,000
questions you have we've got Tim to take

1447
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:46,960
some yeah no II really enjoyed it it's a

1448
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:49,630
really good insight I think just on the

1449
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,210
nexus stuff because as you know I've

1450
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:56,739
kind of been delving into the yes

1451
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:58,480
grommets kill stuff lately yes in the

1452
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,310
year and connect we enjoying the same

1453
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,920
sort of ideas Nexus where you know you

1454
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:05,410
want a really good kind of well-oiled

1455
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,420
well so function and scrum team that's

1456
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:10,120
doing it really well and then you're

1457
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:12,820
kind of stealing it Oh Tiffin I take the

1458
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:14,620
view that scrum at skill kind of is

1459
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:16,600
similar to Nexus in that you know it

1460
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:18,460
doesn't really add much more than just

1461
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,960
you just got lots of scrum teams then

1462
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,750
you've got some additional teams are

1463
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,670
just supporting you as you scale up so

1464
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:27,130
you start on the scrums and then some of

1465
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:30,030
the government's teams but Nexus those

1466
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:32,370
scenes are even more simpler than that

1467
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,380
do you see any in

1468
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:38,970
Challenge have you ever so implemented

1469
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:41,930
Nexus somebody coming in and Nexus is a

1470
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:45,450
framework I think you think Nexus lacks

1471
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:49,220
so yeah there are tons of things that

1472
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:53,570
Nexus lakhs it's supposed to like them

1473
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:57,030
it's it is just a framework just like

1474
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:59,010
scrum lacks what is your definition of

1475
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:00,600
done yeah if you don't have a good

1476
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:04,560
definition of done you're scrums not

1477
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:07,650
going to be very good if you you don't

1478
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:10,070
know where your backlog comes from and

1479
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:12,150
how to get that and create a backlog

1480
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,490
scrum doesn't tell you how to do that

1481
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:18,780
and Nexus is the same it's it's trying

1482
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:22,250
to be um it's trying not to be

1483
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:24,870
prescriptive on your business practices

1484
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:26,790
because the the the reality is that the

1485
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:29,430
way sorry I've said that quite a lot the

1486
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:34,050
reality is I'll strain stop doing that

1487
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:37,020
and every organization is unique the

1488
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:43,610
success or failure of an organization is

1489
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:46,890
in that uniqueness so the idea that and

1490
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:50,460
i know i'm i was pooping unsafe a lot

1491
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:52,950
but the idea that you can have every

1492
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:58,260
organization use the same blueprint and

1493
01:14:52,950 --> 01:15:02,730
be just as successful is is why Nexus

1494
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:06,270
and scrum at scale and scrum are very

1495
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:08,100
compact and the minimum to solve the the

1496
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:10,050
empirical problem you want to create

1497
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,550
empirical process control system so you

1498
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:14,160
can expect and adapt to the best

1499
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:19,620
possible outcome or at least the most

1500
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:23,660
relevant okay bad idea and I think ken

1501
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:26,880
and Jeff almost totally agree between

1502
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:28,950
Nexus and scrum at scale and there's

1503
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,870
just the some differences in the

1504
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:33,780
terminology but definitely there's a

1505
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:36,210
little bit more in scrum at scale that

1506
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:39,120
can just didn't want to be prescriptive

1507
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:40,860
about and I think that's that's okay I

1508
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,829
think there's room for all of the

1509
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,770
frameworks

1510
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:47,440
and I will say if if you're using a

1511
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:51,340
scrum at scale and you're going to have

1512
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:55,360
exactly the same outcomes as you might

1513
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:58,329
have if you use Nexus as long as you see

1514
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:02,170
it as a starting point and a foundation

1515
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:03,510
and not here's what we're gonna do does

1516
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:08,469
that make sense

1517
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:10,119
yeah I think so I think as you see the

1518
01:16:08,469 --> 01:16:11,860
best Fremont's are probably ones that

1519
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:14,050
it's exactly in the definition of a

1520
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,849
framework right it kind of give some

1521
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:17,619
shape but it doesn't try to be too

1522
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:18,670
prescriptive and it shouldn't be because

1523
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:21,070
then it's good

1524
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:22,480
yes it's dictating too much to unit it's

1525
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:24,790
going to be restrictive right and

1526
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,559
constrain you and every as you say every

1527
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:29,679
organization is unique so you need to

1528
01:16:26,559 --> 01:16:32,800
have but room to maneuver to a little

1529
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:36,159
needs and then that's a good thing yeah

1530
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:41,349
it did any questions come in I'm gonna

1531
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:43,270
get good ones here yeah I like this

1532
01:16:41,349 --> 01:16:45,250
first one so Mark Martin is asking

1533
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:47,860
because I often have this conversation

1534
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:49,809
myself so Mars is interested in soft

1535
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:52,239
product owner opinions so if we pull

1536
01:16:49,809 --> 01:16:54,760
them from they always just don't some

1537
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:56,170
other ones have common one say if we

1538
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,260
pull them from the business you know

1539
01:16:56,170 --> 01:17:02,440
people gets appointed you know into the

1540
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:06,340
rule and they tend to be economics bag

1541
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:08,409
is there any ways of any good ways of

1542
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:10,420
can I help and get them into shape in

1543
01:17:08,409 --> 01:17:12,610
your experience cuz you know what the

1544
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:14,380
different types of deals right they come

1545
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:17,409
in different flavors what are your

1546
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:19,119
thoughts on helping app you get to the

1547
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:22,059
place you might want them to so that it

1548
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,920
affected yeah I miss equation I'm

1549
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:26,250
definitely I'm definitely going to punt

1550
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:30,489
the professional scrum product owner and

1551
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:32,559
so you know I don't teach that one so

1552
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:38,290
I'm putting somebody else these things

1553
01:17:32,559 --> 01:17:40,420
but I think that that many product

1554
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:41,619
owners when when they first start and

1555
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:43,090
even if they've been approached or for

1556
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:46,239
quite a long time they have a very

1557
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:49,840
narrow view of what a product owners job

1558
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:53,410
is very narrow and

1559
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:58,870
if you think about a product owner as

1560
01:17:53,410 --> 01:18:03,610
being fully fiscally accountable what

1561
01:17:58,870 --> 01:18:06,940
they choose to spend money on then that

1562
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:08,760
idea of accountability inside of scrum

1563
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:16,360
which comes with that product owner rule

1564
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:17,770
accountability for value is is is key to

1565
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,660
that so if they don't understand that

1566
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,670
accountability or they don't enact that

1567
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:24,310
accountability so they need to be

1568
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:26,830
looking at the market market trends they

1569
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:29,440
need to be looking at and how users are

1570
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:32,620
actually using the product and a lot of

1571
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:35,280
or quite a lot of UX comes under the

1572
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:39,160
product owner world because that's how

1573
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,340
users interact with their ideas these

1574
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:44,020
are all business problems to go solve

1575
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:47,620
the technical part actually hit that

1576
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:49,960
tends to not be the biggest problem it's

1577
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:53,100
getting those product owners up to speed

1578
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:56,980
and I do have a company I worked with in

1579
01:18:53,100 --> 01:19:01,900
Australia a consulting company and and

1580
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:04,090
they they themselves would pay for the

1581
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,720
potential product owners from their

1582
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:10,930
customers to go on the professional

1583
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:13,450
scrum product owner class so that they

1584
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:16,720
knew what was expected of them and they

1585
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:18,550
found that that I guess 2000 Australian

1586
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,160
dollars that two thousand dollar

1587
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:23,760
investment made a massive difference to

1588
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:27,160
the success or failure of their projects

1589
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,220
with those customers because they really

1590
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:32,770
understood the scope of that product

1591
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:34,390
product owner role leti that comes with

1592
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:36,340
it I'll tell you something

1593
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:39,430
I've been through the part-owner class

1594
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:42,010
and and I figured out that I wouldn't

1595
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:44,260
ever want to be a product owner and I've

1596
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,550
done it I've done the PSP you and I

1597
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:48,760
think you're right I think if you're

1598
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:51,760
really doing it there's a lot for one

1599
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:54,460
person to be accountable for and just

1600
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:57,250
you know the different dimensions to the

1601
01:19:54,460 --> 01:20:02,230
role yeah you know that there are so

1602
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:03,760
alongside you to piece in some ways you

1603
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:06,390
and a bit like they were

1604
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:10,120
you know we talked about the the Nexus

1605
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:11,440
mchugh the product yeah exactly so the

1606
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,970
scrum at scale you know if you're the

1607
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,710
chief product owner you might likely

1608
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:16,000
actually be the chief exec and you're

1609
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,610
cleaning that room

1610
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,150
some organizations in it's like that so

1611
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:25,300
yeah it's so I would say just as a final

1612
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:27,940
product owner thing is your product

1613
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:30,580
owner is the one that's accountable to

1614
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:34,390
the business for value delivery not the

1615
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:36,640
development team so if your development

1616
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:40,030
team are have good engineering practices

1617
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,070
and are delivering high-quality working

1618
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:44,500
increments every iteration but they're

1619
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,210
building the wrong thing the buck should

1620
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,440
stop at the product owner not at the

1621
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:50,560
development team because they don't

1622
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:53,530
decide what they go work on having some

1623
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:57,220
of those ideas engrained into that role

1624
01:20:53,530 --> 01:20:59,590
and will help if people feel that

1625
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:04,060
they're they're responsible for spending

1626
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:05,950
money they'll up their game misuk anyone

1627
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,840
yeah not sure they get that's an

1628
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:11,170
excellent put got another one for you

1629
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,950
here oh yeah just about something so

1630
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:14,440
cake leagues

1631
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:16,780
I guess it's coming back to what you

1632
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:18,640
were talking about earlier by we talked

1633
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:21,670
about three more simple prescriptive

1634
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:24,550
they are so if we avoid being

1635
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:26,380
prescriptive do we risk never being able

1636
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:29,290
to set a direction of travel

1637
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:29,710
ie doing scrum badly as they accept it

1638
01:21:29,290 --> 01:21:34,150
norm

1639
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:40,180
I think that is an interesting point so

1640
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:43,360
that the question is if we're being less

1641
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:45,820
prescriptive are we in danger of off

1642
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:51,240
doing doing scrum badly as just

1643
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:56,080
attempting that yeah um I I would say no

1644
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:59,980
because what what are what are the

1645
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:03,450
transparencies in scrum give you three

1646
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:06,310
transparencies in scrum oK you've got

1647
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:09,010
transparency of the future in the

1648
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:11,920
product backlog do we know where we're

1649
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:13,870
going and how we might start to get

1650
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,979
there that's the part of the owners I

1651
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:18,619
came to

1652
01:22:14,979 --> 01:22:20,989
so if you don't have an ordered backlog

1653
01:22:18,619 --> 01:22:23,479
if everybody in the organization that

1654
01:22:20,989 --> 01:22:25,939
needs to it doesn't understand what's in

1655
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:27,889
that backlog and why it's there you've

1656
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:30,679
got a problem you're not doing scrum

1657
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:31,519
yeah that rule of product owner is not

1658
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:35,510
doing its job

1659
01:22:31,519 --> 01:22:38,449
and you've got the the Sprint backlog

1660
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:41,179
which provides transparency for the

1661
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:42,860
present what you're doing now that has

1662
01:22:41,179 --> 01:22:45,139
its own things but not aware that just

1663
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:49,610
no and then you get transparency of the

1664
01:22:45,139 --> 01:22:52,999
past which is the usable increment so in

1665
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:57,860
this in software terms you need to have

1666
01:22:52,999 --> 01:22:59,590
working software that can be deployed to

1667
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:04,369
production at the end of every iteration

1668
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:06,889
including the first iteration does your

1669
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:08,949
team have that if not they're doing

1670
01:23:06,889 --> 01:23:13,309
scrum badly they're doing agile badly

1671
01:23:08,949 --> 01:23:15,829
yeah you need to get that minimum bar I

1672
01:23:13,309 --> 01:23:21,289
and I think it's often overlooked the

1673
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:23,659
minimum bar for scrum is a usable

1674
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:25,010
increment you have to have working

1675
01:23:23,659 --> 01:23:28,309
software at the end of your sprint

1676
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:29,899
otherwise that wasn't a sprint is then

1677
01:23:28,309 --> 01:23:31,489
you have no transparency you can't

1678
01:23:29,899 --> 01:23:34,489
inspect and adapt you don't have an

1679
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:36,619
empirical process control system I think

1680
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:38,689
in in this group we can have this

1681
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:40,550
conversation but when you're talking

1682
01:23:38,689 --> 01:23:42,709
with customers you have to be a little

1683
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:44,899
bit more pragmatic and say well okay

1684
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:46,550
you're doing scrum because you tried

1685
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:49,789
really hard to get a working increment

1686
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:53,989
and but I wouldn't expect a team to be

1687
01:23:49,789 --> 01:23:55,909
on Sprint 30 and still unable to get a

1688
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:58,789
usable increment every single sprint

1689
01:23:55,909 --> 01:24:00,919
that should be a no-brainer by then yeah

1690
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:03,949
there's your DevOps team at Microsoft

1691
01:24:00,919 --> 01:24:10,729
which was 40 teams working together on

1692
01:24:03,949 --> 01:24:14,769
one product took about 15 15 was a 15

1693
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:18,709
maybe less or maybe 10 10 to 15 Sprint's

1694
01:24:14,769 --> 01:24:20,090
together craft together but that was six

1695
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:24,039
hundred and fifty people working

1696
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:27,829
together on one product but since then

1697
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:29,749
every sprint of the last

1698
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:31,579
hundred and fifty odd Sprint's eight

1699
01:24:29,749 --> 01:24:34,780
years of sprinting has been deployed to

1700
01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:37,849
production that's pretty impressive

1701
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:41,869
that's that's like your minimum bar so

1702
01:24:37,849 --> 01:24:45,859
so Craig I I think that's the difference

1703
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:46,629
between mechanical scrum actually doing

1704
01:24:45,859 --> 01:24:49,570
it

1705
01:24:46,629 --> 01:24:54,399
focus on the the values and principles

1706
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:58,519
building trust the transparencies and

1707
01:24:54,399 --> 01:25:00,769
good scrum will come out of that and but

1708
01:24:58,519 --> 01:25:02,989
it is difficult it's a long journey and

1709
01:25:00,769 --> 01:25:05,510
you need to uplift the skills on your

1710
01:25:02,989 --> 01:25:07,269
team and your product owner along the

1711
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:10,760
way to get there and I would definitely

1712
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:11,599
create look at the Kanban guide for

1713
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:15,999
scrum teams

1714
01:25:11,599 --> 01:25:19,099
that's the bat size and flow

1715
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:22,579
optimization that you might be looking

1716
01:25:19,099 --> 01:25:37,039
for to take your not so good looking

1717
01:25:22,579 --> 01:25:41,510
scrum to the next level that's a

1718
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:43,519
question but I guess you know but you

1719
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:45,979
know this whole idea kind of starting

1720
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:48,320
somewhere right we get it right you know

1721
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:51,379
you just make a start I remember you

1722
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:55,579
said coming in stable one of these guys

1723
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:56,809
had a kind of core a chairman still when

1724
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:59,449
you start somewhere you do need a

1725
01:25:56,809 --> 01:26:01,909
relatively good starting point how do

1726
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:04,579
you go about trying to at least figure

1727
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:06,109
out what might be a good start

1728
01:26:04,579 --> 01:26:08,510
you know you do it you do need something

1729
01:26:06,109 --> 01:26:10,010
how do you identify that it depends what

1730
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:11,929
your I would say it depends what your

1731
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:14,949
focuses I'm a good consultant when

1732
01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:19,729
everything starts with it depends and

1733
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:23,739
you you're if if I'm in as a scrum

1734
01:26:19,729 --> 01:26:26,749
master with a scrum team by my focus and

1735
01:26:23,739 --> 01:26:28,760
while I've got a site focus of getting

1736
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:32,179
good product ownership that can be a

1737
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:34,189
little bit bigger political not to crack

1738
01:26:32,179 --> 01:26:35,989
and but getting a high quality

1739
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:38,869
engineering team is something you can

1740
01:26:35,989 --> 01:26:39,710
focus on and having a good definition of

1741
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:43,040
done

1742
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:45,050
is is for me one of the top starting

1743
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,430
points if you can get the team building

1744
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:48,380
good software even if you're building

1745
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:50,330
the wrong software it's no longer the

1746
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,840
team's problem if that kind of makes

1747
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:54,200
sense

1748
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:55,430
um so one of the exercises I always try

1749
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,440
and do with teams at the start even

1750
01:26:55,430 --> 01:27:01,580
teams that have been working together in

1751
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:05,120
scrum for a while um is to get everybody

1752
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:07,370
together who has to stay it's okay to

1753
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:09,320
release your software to production so

1754
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:11,840
you get your team you get your change

1755
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:14,890
dudes you've got your ops whatever

1756
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,330
you've got get everybody together and

1757
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:19,700
get everybody do our liberating

1758
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:21,770
structure the one two for all liberating

1759
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:25,070
structure and get everybody to write

1760
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:27,880
post-its for everything that has to be

1761
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:31,340
true to ship yourself or to production

1762
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:35,120
what needs to be true get all of those

1763
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:37,780
post-its on a board de doop it that is

1764
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:41,450
in effect your definition of done that

1765
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:43,070
mirrors usable increment yeah you have

1766
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:44,540
to be able to ship it to production for

1767
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:46,940
it to be usable therefore all of those

1768
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:48,560
things have to be true and then draw I

1769
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:51,190
have another board with a line on it

1770
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:54,020
above the line is stuff you can do now

1771
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:56,450
below the line is stuff you can't do yet

1772
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:59,530
it's just not it's not possible to do

1773
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:01,850
that get organized the stickies

1774
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:04,040
what's above the line is your current

1775
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:06,110
definition of done what's below the line

1776
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:09,410
are opportunities for improvement

1777
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:12,560
impediments for removal work towards at

1778
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:14,330
every sprint at your retrospective be

1779
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,940
looking at the things that are below the

1780
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:20,690
line is there anything that we've done

1781
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:22,910
enough engineering work we've upskilled

1782
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:26,690
our processes our practices are called

1783
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:29,830
enough to move something up to that

1784
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:32,870
definition of done and put a pin in it

1785
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:35,000
and I think that that's where I would

1786
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:36,860
start with most teams that that initial

1787
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,670
definition of done and what are our

1788
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:43,850
options for later hopefully everything's

1789
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:45,260
above the light then you have a usable

1790
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:47,300
increment that you can deploy to

1791
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:49,510
production with no further work required

1792
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:52,340
from the development team

1793
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:55,490
it's good sure great

1794
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:58,940
that's hard though fraud yes yeah well

1795
01:28:55,490 --> 01:29:01,160
you get that right you know please you

1796
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:02,990
do I was gonna say you look you know not

1797
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:04,670
feel the good place I yeah yeah you

1798
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:08,240
might be building the rain I don't but

1799
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:09,560
you're in a fairly good Wow

1800
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,720
comes by thought you said LA you wanna

1801
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,010
add value to the customer all right well

1802
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:15,580
not many other questions coming through

1803
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:18,500
so I'm just conscious entertain some

1804
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:20,180
minute um do you want to see a couple of

1805
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,710
stuff you've got coming up

1806
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:22,940
I've got coffee some things you've got

1807
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:24,860
the paper in and all you're gonna have

1808
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:26,810
to move to virtual and you've probably

1809
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:28,820
done a bit of work to do on that front

1810
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:31,850
but you want to just if we're we're

1811
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:33,200
scramble here yeah we're scrambling

1812
01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:36,080
around a little bit trying to figure out

1813
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:38,840
how to do this not just from you know

1814
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,970
flip that switch and make it virtual but

1815
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:45,110
how do we can actually deliver classes

1816
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:48,380
virtually um yeah so I've got a bunch of

1817
01:29:45,110 --> 01:29:51,410
classes that I had a pre set up for

1818
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:51,860
Edinburgh and I think in two weeks I

1819
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:55,610
have a

1820
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:57,980
PSM and a provincial scrum master and a

1821
01:29:55,610 --> 01:30:00,410
professional scrum with UX class and

1822
01:29:57,980 --> 01:30:02,750
they'll both be moving to virtual but

1823
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:05,150
they're pretty near nobody signed up for

1824
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:08,180
them yet mainly because of all the

1825
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:10,180
things that are going on and so if

1826
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:13,880
anybody's interested please let me know

1827
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:16,810
about that and then Daniel Vacanti who

1828
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:20,630
was one of the original Kanban method

1829
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:23,900
founders a Corbis and who co-founded the

1830
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:26,510
LGU with David Anderson it is going to

1831
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:29,930
be teaching professional scrum with

1832
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:31,850
Kanban with me meant to be an Edinburgh

1833
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:35,840
class again but we'll be doing it online

1834
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:38,270
and I think after that we have our Apple

1835
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:42,950
II professional agile leadership

1836
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:45,440
essentials which focuses that that

1837
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:48,800
middle management layer in an

1838
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:51,380
organization that doesn't work directly

1839
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:55,520
with on a scrum team that works with

1840
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:57,740
scrum teams how do they move their game

1841
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:01,010
from management towards leadership

1842
01:30:57,740 --> 01:31:02,539

01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:04,069
