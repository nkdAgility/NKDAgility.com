    "reasoning": "The content focuses on engineering excellence, Agile mindset, and process improvement, but makes no direct reference to the Product Developer role, its definition, or collective accountability. While some concepts like collaboration and technical skill are tangentially aligned, the main discussion centers on general organizational agility, engineering practices, and product ownership, not the explicit responsibilities, behaviors, or structure unique to Product Developers. The closest overlap is in the emphasis on technical capabilities and cross-functionality, but these are discussed generically, not within the category's accountability context. The audience is practitioners interested in Agile delivery, which is adjacent to the Product Developer category but not strictly targeted. Overall, relevance is low: there are no direct mentions, and core category concepts are addressed only superficially or incidentally.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content discusses engineering excellence and agile transformation broadly without addressing the Product Developer role or its distinctive accountability. While related topics are present, there's minimal direct relevance to the formal Product Developer category as defined.",

There are no direct references to AI, human-AI teams, or the emergence of cognitive capabilities from such collaboration. The main themes revolve around cultural change, process metrics, and skill development within human teams. The closest tangential relevance is mention of evidence-based management, which only indirectly relates to decision-making. The audience (Agile/DevOps practitioners) partially overlaps, but the core subject matter lacks the AI elements required for strong fit. No penalties applied, as there is no outdated or critical content.",

While these are tangentially related to Agentic Engineering, there are no explicit mentions of maximizing agency (human or AI), ethical AI, systemic observability, or the core philosophical framing of agentic practices. The discussion centers on quality and agility but lacks depth on autonomy, decentralization, or AI as a collaborator. Audience aligns (practitioners/engineers), and the narrative is focused, but overall the content fits more with general engineering excellence and Agile transformation than with the specific intent of Agentic Engineering.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The piece addresses engineering excellence and agility with a focus on process, learning, and improvement.
