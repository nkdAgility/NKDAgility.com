awesome

22
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
i love it when uh buttons don't work uh

23
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
so we're gonna

24
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,000
today's

25
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,360
uh session is around the idea of user

26
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
stories

27
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,680
depending on the level of knowledge that

28
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
folks have we'll see

29
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,320
which exercises we do and and what we

30
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,200
don't i have some uh

31
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,959
things that i've prepared and i know

32
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,880
that they're all but they're always fun

33
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,279
even if even if there are sometimes a

34
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,200
bit basic but is getting getting

35
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
everybody discussing which is the

36
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
important part

37
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,440
uh but the first thing i have here is

38
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,399
just a a fast pass a little introductory

39
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,959
exercise i can see we've got

40
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
five participants now that's that's

41
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,839
pretty good a few more we'll drop in

42
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,440
it's 5 30. um so what i'm going to do is

43
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,600
i'm just going to do a little assignment

44
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,680
to rooms

45
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
and i'm going to do two rooms there we

46
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,399
go

47
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,519
so i'm going to assign you into into

48
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,120
breakout rooms and on the mural if i

49
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,440
summon everybody i don't think

50
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
everybody's there yet but on the mural

51
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,240
um you should be able to see like five

52
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,079
hexagons with numbers in the corner and

53
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,000
if you go to the room

54
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,920
the hexagon which matches your room

55
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,560
number so if you've not used microsoft

56
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
teams uh breakout rooms before at the

57
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,480
top of the window for the breakout rooms

58
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
it says the name of the room and it's

59
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
just room one room two room three right

60
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,680
it's not not super complicated

61
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
um and i'd like you to oh tell you what

62
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
i probably need to lock all of these

63
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,640
things that would be a good idea there

64
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
we go

65
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,720
yeah that's always has a

66
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,880
i i found out anna a really cool tool

67
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
for mural

68
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,560
so you know sometimes when you're

69
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,320
dragging around and you end up dragging

70
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,640
an object that you didn't want to or

71
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,040
dragging a post-it around

72
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
if you hold down space

73
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,200
it lets you drag without moving anything

74
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,320
without interacting with the surface so

75
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,519
that's that

76
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,760
i learned that

77
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,079
today i think i knew it before but i had

78
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
to look up the keyboard command again

79
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,040
all right so we're going to do this this

80
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
icebreaker so there's the seven

81
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,600
questions that kind of cut seven

82
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,839
numbered questions in each room so i'm

83
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,320
going to click to open the mural it is

84
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
too late to go back now

85
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,040
uh the sorry open the mural open the

86
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
breakout rooms it's too late to go back

87
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,160
so they will just open and so make sure

88
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
that you access the mural in the

89
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279

a breakout room where you can start

132
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
answering at those

133
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,600
questions

134
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,279
i'm gonna put

135
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
i'll put eight minutes on the timer

136
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,360
because we've had a few minutes there we

137
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
go

138
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,000
perfect okay

139
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,120
so everybody's out in the breakout rooms

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
awesome

141
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,639
i can see people wandering around and

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
creating well nobody's creating post-its

143
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,480
yet but it's that's part of the fun they

144
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,600
maybe haven't had a lot of experience

145
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,959
with mural

146
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,800
um

147
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,240
i can do this ask to be followed

148
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,399
it's a balance on whether you send

149
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,920
people out right away or you have a

150
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,720
little bit more time to to explain mural

151
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
um

152
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,680
unfortunately for these

153
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,760
small workshops it takes

154
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,040
a lot of the a lot of the time

155
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,440
uh for

156
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:58,000
a live virtual class and we probably

157
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,600
spend i guess up 15 20 minutes just on

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,880
here's how all of the tools work and

159
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,880
what we're going to do and how we're

160
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,720
going gonna interact with it but

161
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,639
um

162
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,399
that's great for 15 minutes out of a

163
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
two-day class but not great for 15

164
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,079
minutes out of 90 minutes

165
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
yeah

166
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,600
so how is everybody today so it's three

167
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,600
four five six seven eight people would

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
get eight people that's pretty good

169
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
um so they're just often there their

170
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,639
breakout looking at these questions and

171
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,440
answers i can see the

172
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,880
the

173
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,040
mouse pointers

174
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
moving around for those that are here

175
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,279
and i asked to be followed so that they

176
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,000
went to that that place

177
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,199
um and hopefully they zoomed in

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,360
um i use mural for all of these sessions

179
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,079
and i i'm talking to myself but i'm

180
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
talking to you if you're watching online

181
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
either live or before anybody watching

182
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079
live

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,519
nope just me uh saying we will be

184
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,959
starting soon i don't know if there's a

185
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,480
wickler away from me to see how many

186
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,000
people are actually watching i think i

187
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
can look here

188
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,279

189
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,279

home

191
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,480
channels spinning

192
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,959
nobody

193
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
awesome oh no it's refreshing again

194
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,480
i don't know that it can tell on

195
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
linkedin so if you're watching on

196
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
linkedin or youtube but it should be

197
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,320
streaming on linkedin facebook

198
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,320
but there's none on facebook

199
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,680
none on youtube at the moment but that's

200
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
okay

201
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,320
that's okay the purpose of this

202
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,160
is for the people that turn up

203
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
not uh for you guys oh look i'm being a

204
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,480
bit

205
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,880
this is why i've ordered a new computer

206
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,880
i have uh ordered an

207
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,800
alienware aurora 13 because i hate

208
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
having

209
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
lack of processor capability

210
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
um so i'm just checking if there's

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,800
anything i can close and i can

212
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,920
definitely close

213
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,120
outlook let's get rid of that malarkey

214
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,959
and do i have a browser window here i do

215
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,600
let me kill that that's four browser

216
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,600
tabs gone

217
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
there we go

218
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,199
too many devices too many devices not

219
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,040
enough processing power

220
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,519
so they've got a

221
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,279
i'm probably going to close the room oh

222
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,560
it looks like

223
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
is sean

224
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,839
on his own

225
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,199
yeah that's the downside of oh no maybe

226
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,040
they are in the meeting are you in the

227
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,399
meeting

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,720
um

229
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,839
i'm gonna close the rooms and expire the

230
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
timer

231
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
bring everybody back

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,360
time's up

233
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,399
let me close that and i'm gonna have a

234
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,079
look at what were my questions

235
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,079
what are requirements what are not

236
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,079
requirements

237
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
i think at least one

238
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,839
yes anna

239
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,799
uh nothing we were just discussing

240
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,760
i think at least one of you gets stuck

241
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:14,079
in a room with somebody who left

242
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,079
that always sucks was that you sean

243
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,439
maybe he's gonna off to make a cup of

244
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
tea because he was in a room with nobody

245
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:34,000
that is that is that is okay uh we will

246
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,640
uh progress at forward anyway so i am

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
interested in some of the ideas that you

248
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
you talked about so there are a number

249
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,480
of questions there

250
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,840
in the in the mural

251
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,320
around

252
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,640
what are requirements what they're not

253
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
but it really all comes round to that

254
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,039
idea in the middle and of what are your

255
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,200
biggest questions

256
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,000
about user stories

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,400
because those answers will help me

258
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,440
figure out what we're going to do for

259
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
for the rest of the time

260
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,320
anna

261
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,960
what are your biggest questions around

262
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,960
user stories

263
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,640
i'm all would be the questions i just

264
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,640
don't know but are not requirements i

265
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
have no idea here

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,440
all other questions are fine

267
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,440
what are not requirements yeah

268
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
right because we

269
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,320
for requirements you may have also what

270
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,840
needs to be done the functional the

271
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,919
non-functional requirements but what's

272
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
not required

273
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
i don't know

274
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,160
honestly

275
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,559
so

276
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,400
um

277
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
yeah that's a good question i will come

278
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
back to that

279
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
erica

280
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,640
did you generate any questions

281
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,120
okay um

282
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,200
first of all um

283
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,080
i don't know uh

284
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,799
that

285
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,880
in general uh not talking about only

286
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,720
requirements but when i

287
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,679
when i start uh

288
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,640
working on a project and then uh going

289
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
to

290
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,799
go into the more details with the user

291
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,559
stories uh the main

292
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
parts of the questions

293
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,720
are

294
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,440
about the value what are the values

295
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,000
in

296
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,880
whatever we are doing or we're trying to

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
to

298
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,280
to put in the project so applying

299
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
applied to the user storage what is the

300
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,440
value related to

301
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,520
what we are asking for

302
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
and uh i don't know maybe your

303
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,760
requirements are you can have a lot of

304
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,919
different requirements functional

305
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,640
requirements

306
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,799
but not only functional requirements

307
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,000
it has to be

308
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,000
transforming something

309
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,400
provable let's say so whenever whenever

310
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,080
we have something that can be can be

311
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,080
shown can be

312
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,320
analyzed that can be

313
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
uh

314
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
i don't know

315
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,400
uh related to some to some retrospective

316
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
or to some feedback is a requirement for

317
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
me

318
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,480
okay

319
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
you can regard usability functions

320
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,799
but everything has to be that is to have

321
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
a value because you don't have a value

322
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
related to it you don't

323
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,640
you don't need it so you don't need that

324
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
requirement so it's not terrifying for

325
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
the project

326
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
okay

327
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,080
no no that's that's that's definitely uh

328
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,080
interesting sean

329
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
uh

330
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
for me it's one of the benefits of using

331
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,000
this story

332
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
okay

333
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
benefits of user stories

334
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,159
okay

335
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,679
naily

336
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,840
if i'm saying your name wrong just beat

337
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:07,360
me up that's the best way

338
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,080
well i am like more concerned from

339
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,840
like in the beginning like how

340
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:19,280
can you start defining your user story

341
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:23,520
yep like how and how do you set like the

342
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,520
criteria acceptance how do you know

343
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,120
what to include on which on each one

344
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,640
yeah that's that's going to be that's

345
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
going to be interesting so like what

346
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,559
what to

347
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,960
hmm yeah how do you start and what to

348
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,799
include

349
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,240
start and

350
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,280
what to include sometimes there's a

351
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,919
different kind of process and i've been

352
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,039
in some teams that they want to add like

353
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,320
all the process in one

354
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,919
only user story so that confused me

355
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,200
okay

356
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,679
yeah you want to stick everything in a

357
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,120
user story so it becomes this massive

358
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,799
massive document of yeah yeah it's too

359
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
too big

360
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
too big

361
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,679
yeah how do you know when to break down

362
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,200
a user story

363
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,799
that might be an interesting question as

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,240
well

365
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,840
yeah

366
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,400
so i uh

367
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,480
morning erie how you doing

368
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,360
well morning might be for you

369
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,280
it's my daughter's

370
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,400
team's name

371
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,880
too long oh but uh yeah

372
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,520
i was using uh my work uh computer last

373
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
time but this time i'm just using my my

374
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,640
daughter while

375
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,640
even though she is only seven but from

376
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,640
her school there are still teams that

377
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,760
my daughter uses

378
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,840
they have half their lessons in teams

379
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,960
and half their lessons were in google

380
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
classroom

381
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
and the teachers booked lessons over the

382
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,039
top of each other because the calendars

383
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
weren't in sync

384
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,400
so that was a lot of fun

385
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,039
so i i have a few answers here over on

386
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,039
the right hand side so i'm just gonna

387
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,559
summon i think i already did i'll summon

388
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,720
everybody on the mural are you on the on

389
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,320

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
hold on i'm gonna need uh i'm gonna need

391
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,840
to post it because i'm gonna keep

392
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
calling you airy if i don't have a

393
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,440
post-it

394
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,360
loan uh yeah i

395
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,400
put my name in the chat

396
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,799
and uh i know it's hard to pronounce but

397
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
in fact if you try it it's not hard

398
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,360
no you're long any reason

399
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
luckily

400
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,200
no yeah you don't use it

401
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,120
to me yeah perfect it's very very cool

402
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
yeah i've now got a little post-it down

403
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,960
here with julong written on it

404
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
um

405
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,559
that'll help me out there

406
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,640
i do that all the time for my classes

407
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,400
now because sometimes

408
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
people have spellings that i can't

409
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,600
understand or just names i can't

410
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,960
pronounce

411
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,400
all right so you asked the question

412
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,279
and an hour you were concerned with the

413
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,880
question what are not requirements

414
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,520
and i have some things that i don't

415
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,120
think are requirements here a solution

416
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,400
design

417
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,080
is not a requirement

418
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
right if you're defining the solution

419
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
you've gone way beyond like what do i

420
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,200
need

421
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
um a decision about implementation

422
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,080
i guess that kind of goes with a

423
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,039
solution design right it's not decision

424
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
about

425
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,400
implementation

426
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,440
and it probably it isn't a definition of

427
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,440
what you're going to get

428
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,279
right i think that's the hardest truth

429
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,279
for organizations to to to handle but it

430
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,039
but it is a reality

431
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,080
um it's not a source of truth for what

432
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:45,279
the software does

433
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,279
they're not really requirements

434
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,159
if they were requirements

435
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,480
we would have to do them all

436
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,520
but most of the time we don't have to do

437
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
them all

438
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
right things change

439
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,679
over the life of the project

440
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,360
uh some of the things we do and we don't

441
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,000
need other things

442
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,000
so they couldn't have been required then

443
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
if we don't build them

444
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,320
so an expression that um my my good

445
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,559
friend david starr

446
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,080
likes to use is that they are

447
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
desirements

448
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,960
stuff we want the product to do

449
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,679
that it doesn't do yet

450
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,520
and sometimes we don't always get what

451
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,120
we want

452
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,400
right that's why that's why i like

453
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,600
desirement

454
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,159
uh that's a little bit better

455
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,520
yeah wishes what we wish

456
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,480
yeah i like i like i like wishes

457
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
um

458
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840
i first

459
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,919
like

460
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,919
what we need to have before starting

461
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,320
with the user story maybe we need to

462
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,320
have a decision how we're gonna do this

463
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
requirement this ticket or something

464
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,960
like that

465
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,960
before we start working

466
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,880
and also or

467
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,440
how do you see this

468
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,840
uh could you repeat that sorry

469
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,320
the the first two stickers

470
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,320
into like more uh we need to have that

471
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,200
information before starting with the

472
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,520
implementation of the requirement

473
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,679
yeah so so

474
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,640
we want we want to leave

475
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,200
this

476
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
one of the purposes of user stories

477
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
right that was one of the other

478
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,919
questions

479
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,559
was uh like why do we want to use user

480
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,400
scores it's because we want to leave the

481
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,480
implementation

482
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
till as late as possible

483
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
so that we reserve the right to change

484
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,520
our mind

485
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,400
if we have the implementation defined in

486
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,120
the in the requirement in the in in in

487
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,320
the thing that we're being asked to do

488
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,440
that almost always locks us into one

489
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,279
solution

490
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,760
that might not be the right solution

491
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,760
when we get into actually doing it maybe

492
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,039
it's the wrong solution

493
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,120
so i'm i

494
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,559
there are lots of things

495
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,159
that i might

496
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,600
whiteboard

497
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,080
as part of my discussion in the team

498
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,000
right my refinement looking forward into

499
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,600
the future what's coming up next on my

500
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
product backlog we're going to have a

501
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,240
bunch of discussions around what these

502
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,480
things are what it might look like

503
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,840
right but we're trying to concern

504
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,960
ourselves with

505
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,679
what

506
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,880
we want to deliver rather than spend too

507
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,880
much time on how

508
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
right

509
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,159
so

510
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,440
i think

511
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,200
one of the mistakes that teams make

512
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,279
is they don't necessarily reflect on how

513
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,399
much detail

514
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,399
should be in the how

515
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:46,080
there's a lot more detail in the how

516
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
than people think there is in the how

517
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,320
it's true

518
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,600
right every time a developer has to make

519
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,520
a choice

520
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,559
between a and b

521
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,880
it's usually a business decision choice

522
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,640
that the business doesn't make

523
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,520
the developer makes because it's too

524
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,039
late to go speak to the business now

525
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,919
and that's one of the reasons we have

526
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,080
acceptance criteria

527
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,559
in our um

528
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,480
in our user stories as almost a

529
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,919
codification

530
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,919
of our conversations that we have

531
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,039
right we look at the story it's not

532
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,640
enough information to actually build it

533
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,200
right but it's enough information to

534
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,159
start asking questions and poking at

535
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,520
things but then as we get the answers i

536
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,039
i've sat with a team once uh where

537
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,559
they were asking questions of the

538
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,200
product owner and the product owner was

539
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,760
giving answers and nobody was writing

540
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,760
them down

541
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,039
right and i'm like

542
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,360
what's going to happen at the end of

543
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,200
this sprint the product was going to say

544
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,640
i said

545
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,880
that it should be like this and you're

546
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,679
going to have forgotten 10 minutes after

547
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,559
the

548
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,559
refinement session

549
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,440
by recording the session yeah recording

550
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,559
the session is a good way

551
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,120
right um we i resolved it with that team

552
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,200
by uh i kept

553
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,880
poking them and saying no you need to

554
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,120
write it down and they would go yeah

555
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,279
yeah we will

556
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
and i'm like no

557
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,640
write it down now

558
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,640
because you'll forget later or you'll

559
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,120
write it differently later

560
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,799
you won't get a chance to write it down

561
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,960
and then think oh

562
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,840
and i have another question

563
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,080
right

564
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,200
so writing that down recording that

565
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,840
information is really important and one

566
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,840
of the ideas of a user story is that

567
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,399
it's it's a card

568
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,640
right the traditional user story in the

569
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,720
physical world right that we don't often

570
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,760
work in anymore but in the physical

571
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,120
world was a four as a four by three or

572
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,799
six by four

573
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,279
card physical card and on the front you

574
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,919
write what it is you want and you have

575
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,559
to use like a like a sharpie

576
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,960
right so you can't write really small

577
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,880
and then on the back you start writing

578
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,880
down the answers to those questions that

579
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,039
you ask as you start having a

580
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,399
conversation about it

581
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,600
if you run out of space on the cards

582
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,559
it's time for two cards

583
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
right

584
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,200
it's time for two cuts but in the

585
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,440
digital space

586
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
we've got an infinite amount of

587
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,760
card on every card

588
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,640
so sometimes it's very easy

589
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,320
to see too many things

590
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,039
listed

591
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,840
so when i do exercises with teams on

592
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,399
breaking down backlog items

593
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,360
i normally i'm looking at what they're

594
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,880
creating and if there's more than

595
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,880
four acceptance criteria

596
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,480
i might start giving them a poke and

597
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,480
saying should this be two things

598
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,760
based on the estimation of its story

599
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,480
points it's like it's bigger than eight

600
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,559
then yeah you should consider

601
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,840
making it if you're doing story points

602
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,840
story points are

603
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,679
definitely a complimentary practice and

604
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,559
some people love them and some people

605
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,519
absolutely hate them

606
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,080
and don't feel they have uh value

607
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:22,399
i'm a little bit in between i i i've

608
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,399
used both ways story points i tend to

609
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,640
track towards more of a kanban strategy

610
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,880
these days

611
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,840
um but lots of people do still use story

612
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
points

613
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,320
um and yeah but it's a little bit

614
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,799
arbitrary isn't it it might be an eight

615
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,559
for your team but it might be a 22 for

616
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:42,799
or 21 for erica's team that's too big to

617
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,360
do inside of a sprint

618
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,640
in my experience uh storyboards never

619
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,039
work

620
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,240
i don't know if i i've been unlucky till

621
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,320
now but it never

622
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
works with uh with story points so they

623
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,720
we we make or the development team make

624
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,440
an evaluation and that makes an

625
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,880
evaluation and uh

626
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,679
especially at the beginning of the

627
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,679
project uh

628
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,519
the the

629
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,519
i don't know the solution for uh

630
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,440
for for success for being successful

631
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,679
from the beginning is being clear as you

632
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,760
as you said

633
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,480
i don't know

634
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,440
most of the time the problem is the lack

635
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,000
of

636
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,039
communication between the the customer

637
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
and the the developer

638
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,519
yep so i

639
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,519
we

640
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,360
speak different languages

641
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,360
actually so i'm i'm sure i've been clear

642
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,000
and the other two but

643
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,320
at the end so i can make a wonderful

644
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,159
evaluation in story whatever but

645
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,200
actually it's something different uh

646
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,960
from

647
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,600
what we we

648
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,399
both were talking about and

649
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,720
and it's easier when in

650
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:00,640
managing uh a pro and agile project it's

651
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,000
easier but at the beginning of the of a

652
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,799
project field

653
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,519
in my experiences that has always been a

654
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,320
mess with new people not

655
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,440
uh not used to working with uh with a

656
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
jiving

657
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,120
so

658
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,440
story points i don't know if only if

659
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,720
only if the team

660
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,960
it's you he is used to working

661
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,679
very good together he's a very

662
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,159
uh

663
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,159
let's say

664
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,120
very

665
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,440
i don't know the english word but they

666
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,000
they work uh if they've been working a

667
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,399
lot for a lot of time both the class the

668
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,799
customer and the development team of the

669
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,919
world drive team it could be it could

670
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,279
work but

671
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,799
otherwise

672
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,919
story points are

673
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,279
not very

674
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,080
i so i think it it definitely it sounds

675
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,399
like you've been unlucky erica but it

676
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,559
also sounds like anna's maybe been lucky

677
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,600
right that they've been that's that's

678
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,399
okay

679
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,360
um

680
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,880
the way the way i tend to to to look at

681
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,360
story points

682
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,840
is for me there's very little value in

683
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,679
the numbers that's not why i want to do

684
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,119
story points with a team relative

685
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,040
estimation

686
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,560
i want them to have conversations and i

687
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
want to encourage them to have

688
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,839
conversations

689
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,399
and one of the ways we have a

690
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,040
conversation is we need to identify

691
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,760
what do i know that you don't

692
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,599
right um and having doing that that

693
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
planning poker

694
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,440
exercise

695
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
where one team member says oh that's a

696
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,440
that's a that's a two that's super easy

697
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,639
right and another team member says

698
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,679
that's a 21 that's super hard well okay

699
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,599
we've got

700
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,040
somebody knows something that somebody

701
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,119
else doesn't

702
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,440
let's have some conversations around how

703
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,119
do we how do we how do we create how do

704
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,720
we create a cohesive understanding

705
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
across the team

706
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,520
and that's something that the the in in

707
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,560
scrum at least the product owner is

708
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,640
accountable everybody's understanding of

709
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,320
the product backlog items and what they

710
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,040
mean is within the accountability of the

711
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,960
product owner so it's in their interests

712
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,560
to generate as much of those

713
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,359
conversations as we need to

714
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,079
not

715
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,680
we're never going to get the exact same

716
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
story

717
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,119
from each other of what we think

718
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,520
something is and what it actually is

719
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,760
right because we all understand language

720
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,440
and ideas differently that's part of the

721
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,240
value of working in a team is bringing

722
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,160
those different different perspectives

723
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,760
but we can at least

724
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,839
get to some

725
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,440
um

726
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,920
level of agreement

727
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,599
on on what it is we're looking at how

728
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
big is that thing

729
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,079
that for me is the value in in in story

730
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,920
points but lots of people use the

731
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,800
numbers later for their velocity uh

732
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,920
and various things that's that's cool i

733
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,560
prefer the kanban metrics but i do work

734
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,800
with teams that use use velocity just

735
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,000
don't do what one of my teams did which

736
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,640
is sign a contract with the customer

737
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,560
where velocity was specified in the

738
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,359
contract and they had to be within 15

739
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,240
percent of their expected uh don't get

740
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,000
me started on mental things people

741
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,280
putting contracts

742
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,200
um

743
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,800
predicting the future

744
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,960
isn't it

745
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,800
so that that that's why i have this this

746
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,440
this idea of what what are not

747
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,480
requirements and a desirement being an

748
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,880
unenforceable formal expression of hope

749
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,760
that the software will do something

750
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,960
right

751
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,000
uh

752
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,400
i think the feedback loops

753
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,720
in agility that one of the purpose

754
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,200
of the feedback loops specifically

755
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,160
around the the sprint review

756
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,800
is to do that diff between

757
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,280
what did we create and where does the

758
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,359
product need to go next

759
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,000
right because maybe we created something

760
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,200
that wasn't what the users wanted

761
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,920
but was

762
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,680
more was a better way right than what

763
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,760
they expected to get

764
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,359
or maybe it wasn't

765
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,280
right maybe it was exactly what they

766
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,760
wanted and it still wasn't a good way to

767
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,119
build the build the solution

768
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,720
right just because we build what

769
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,040
customers ask for doesn't mean we're

770
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,480
doing the right thing

771
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,200
right i think um

772
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,400
uh one of the other trainers had that

773
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,200
expression day before yesterday i think

774
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,119
you know the the the the fallacy that we

775
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,880
are doing the right thing

776
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,160
if we build what our customers ask us to

777
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,920
build

778
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,599
right that's that's just not true we

779
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,560
should be building what our customers

780
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,800
need

781
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,040
what is the value

782
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,040
right and how do we identify value

783
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,280
values even harder

784
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,280
to identify and work with than than size

785
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,839
right how big are these things that's

786
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,680
easier than what are these things worth

787
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,160
to us

788
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,400
and user stories are trying to

789
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,240
condense it down into something simple

790
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,920
enough and small enough

791
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,280
that it's easier to answer those

792
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,720
questions

793
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,000
that it's easier to answer the question

794
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,320
how big it is and what it's worth

795
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,320
yeah

796
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,720
um

797
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,520
so that

798
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,880
i like the the story around what is a

799
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,160
user story

800
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,760
a card

801
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,599
a conversation and confirmation

802
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,720
right up on what basis are we going to

803
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,560
say that this story is is is complete

804
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,839
but also what does it look like and what

805
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,359
is it we have to have those

806
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,560
conversations

807
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,200
oh

808
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,560
i have a i have a psu issue on my

809
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,119
computer and this one of the screens

810
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,800
keeps going blank and then coming back

811
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,800
that's what happens when dell ships

812
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
machines with graphics cards that are

813
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,599
too powerful but not good enough power

814
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,839
supplies dale looking at you

815
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,839
um

816
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,200
so that what sort of techniques

817
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,480
do you use

818
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,480
to write your requirements

819
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,720
how do you make them transparent to your

820
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,720
team where do you put them

821
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,640
well we were using a jira so

822
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,040
just to put uh the description

823
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,200
in the description section uh to

824
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,680
describe what that story is uh talking

825
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,520
about everyone will answer and during

826
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,640
the planning

827
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,400
we will ask each team member where you

828
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,720
need to improve and uh to clarify it so

829
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,280
everyone can

830
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,160
have the ability to take that story so

831
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,839
that's

832
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
one of my changes

833
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,839
yeah

834
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,680
vera's jira is a really common tool

835
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,240
in the market it's one of the two it's

836
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,880
one of the two big ones and it it it's

837
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,160
it's huge it usually is driven by the

838
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,480
business because they have a lot of

839
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,400
business support and business tools in

840
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,480
the jira space as well um i do see it a

841
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,119
lot in organizations

842
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
anything else

843
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,839
um

844
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,640
also uml

845
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,599
yeah i

846
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,319
well we use uh jiren uh

847
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,960
in my companies uh it's a very powerful

848
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,880
tool but i don't i personally don't

849
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,800
don't really like it it's useful to

850
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,359
to to record

851
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,359
everything about the projects but if you

852
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,400
for the day

853
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,839
daily routine the daily work is not

854
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,240
user friendly i'd say so uh paper

855
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,599
powerpoint for the the daily work i mean

856
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,079
yeah it's

857
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,680
i find it more useful yes you need

858
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,319
something to

859
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,680
record everything especially especially

860
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,160
if you have a big project but

861
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,640
jira is the

862
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,640
the last uh the last thing we

863
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,400
we

864
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,200
update or is a huge if it's a huge

865
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,920
project with a lot of people

866
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,560
called agile but not really agile so

867
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,520
it's uh it i i find it's a very useful

868
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,000
uh tool for a waterfall project so if

869
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,680
it's if it's a small project

870
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,680
during just uh

871
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,800
i think i don't know the essential but

872
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,560
it's not the daily the daily work

873
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
is not for the daily work in my in my

874
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,480
personal opinion

875
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,440
depending on the on the size of the team

876
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,200
uml life for a complex for complex new

877
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,359
projects is very useful because it's

878
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,880
very

879
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,960
it's it's not a tool it's uh it's a

880
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,800
it's a methodology it's uh it's very

881
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,839
useful to uh to complex new projects

882
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,040
otherwise uh even the powerpoint is uh

883
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,400
it works

884
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,560
so if

885
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,720
it works for the theme if you don't have

886
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,160
paper because we are going to paperless

887
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,720
support if and then

888
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,280
yeah yeah what jira

889
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,760
jira was originally released in 2002

890
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,640
so the the chances of the teams that

891
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,480
built jira being agile teams at that

892
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,800
time is very low

893
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,400
for the size of organization

894
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,240
so most likely just like tfs team

895
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,400
foundation server and other tools out

896
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,400
there and they're they're they're

897
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,560
waterfall teams building a waterfall

898
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,839
product to support other waterfall teams

899
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,520
because that's their biggest customer

900
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,000
base at the time

901
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,280
and then they're bolting on a bunch of

902
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,599
capabilities to help agile teams

903
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,319
i do know some teams that use trello and

904
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,520
are super happy with it again just do it

905
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,880
simply

906
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,720
um and in fact uh erica i've been toying

907
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,640
around with some teams

908
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,119
of instead of

909
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,680
if you ask anybody in the agile space

910
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,200
what tool should you use

911
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,480
that all they'll do is hold up one of

912
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,520
these post-its in a whiteboard right

913
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,160
uh

914
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,240
cards stick them to the wall right but

915
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,079
we're kind of a little bit beyond that

916
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,720
now

917
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,960
while pre-covered we maybe could have

918
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,240
had that today it's just not going to

919
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,000
happen and that's not going to change

920
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,000
going forward into the future

921
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,720
and so i actually built a board the

922
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,839
other day for uh for a team in a backlog

923
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,839
uh just in mural

924
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,119
right so they they just have them as

925
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,480
cards on the mural and they can move

926
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,560
them around they can delete them they

927
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,040
can create new ones they can put them

928
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,200
anywhere they want there's no

929
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,800
bounds there's no controls over that

930
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,560
which is like having a whiteboard on the

931
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,720
wall

932
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,400
right that sometimes that well apart

933
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,359
from apart from the fact that mural can

934
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,560
integrate with jira let's not go there

935
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,280
right um like that that that to me is

936
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,040
not

937
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,880
that is not a selling point well it can

938
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,800
integrate with github issues as well i

939
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,640
wonder how that actually works let's not

940
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
go there um

941
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,319
for example the team's planner which is

942
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,319
very basic but we used it too so

943
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,800
that we didn't have uh

944
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,000
for project access

945
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,400
to morel we used it and it was it worked

946
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,560
that well

947
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,240
yeah sometimes sometimes just using

948
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,160
you might think well there's going to be

949
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,800
a lot of manual work

950
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,319
but the reality is that it just makes

951
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,560
things easier because you can do

952
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,720
whatever you want you're not controlled

953
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,160
by the tool and that's sometimes the

954
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,760
problem with the bigger more complicated

955
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,319
tools is you're you're more controlled

956
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,040
by the tool and then you control it

957
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,000
especially in the enterprise situation

958
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,040
where

959
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,359
um your organization controls

960
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,720
the configuration of your tool

961
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,720
so when i when i run with teams i'm i'm

962
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,040
usually using as your devops that's kind

963
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,160
of my my preferred tool if i'm if i'm

964
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,680
online for for other reasons microsoft's

965
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,000
mvp being one of them um but i i usually

966
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,400
give everybody on the team admin

967
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,440
i make the group

968
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,599
that is

969
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,960
uh for team members that team members

970
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,880
get added to i put it in the

971
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,760
administrators group for for that

972
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,359
project because i don't want them not to

973
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,599
be able to do something if they need to

974
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,800
be able to do it

975
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,160
right everybody should be able to

976
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,160
collaborate together yes

977
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,400
regarding uh like uh

978
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,119
if

979
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,760
like for example three development teams

980
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,000
and they are with one

981
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,280
business team they are going to work

982
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,280
together

983
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,880
and uh for sure the business team they

984
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,079
don't know the devops

985
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:39,440
right um

986
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:41,920
yes so i i i i just so i do uh uh uh uh

987
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,240
having a little engagement model where i

988
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,280
do just one hour of consulting for

989
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
customers

990
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,720
and and i had somebody

991
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,880
they can just book it on my website

992
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,720
right and this guy booked it i was

993
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720
interested in what he was doing uh

994
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,960
they're they're using

995
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,520
azure devops

996
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,680
for their entire

997
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,280
business team

998
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,119
and there's no development there's no

999
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,319
software engineering going on at all in

1000
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,319
this company

1001
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,079
so they're they've got azure devops with

1002
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,920
just the work item tracking they've got

1003
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,440
everything else turned off

1004
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,560
and they're using that with the business

1005
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,839
teams and they moved to that from jira

1006
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,880
because it's less complicated

1007
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,440
right it's there's less baggage

1008
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,400
so devops could be used for those

1009
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,640
businesses

1010
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,640
i'm not saying i'm definitely not going

1011
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,359
to say it's a good idea for your teams

1012
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,079
right because i don't know your context

1013
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,960
just you know trying to learn new things

1014
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,280
yeah

1015
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,040
so so they they were using it very

1016
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,359
successfully and the teams were super

1017
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
happy the people that were using it the

1018
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,000
the managers and leaders in the

1019
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,560
organization that were using it were

1020
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,400
super happy because it it

1021
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,160
sometimes you don't want too many

1022
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,359
options

1023
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,000
right and sometimes i feel like and that

1024
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:02,160
i am definitely biased against jira okay

1025
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,240
so take it as uh how it sounds but

1026
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,680
i'm not

1027
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,599
happy at all

1028
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,760
eric has said that i mean i was just

1029
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,359
loved because you guys are not the first

1030
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,839
one to see that every time i said that

1031
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,000
everyone just felt like an idealism just

1032
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:21,440
to give me this look why you're still

1033
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,760
using that jira so because from my top

1034
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,920
level yeah

1035
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,680
pushed us to you that we have no kid

1036
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,839
shows so

1037
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,680
they are they are not you know expertise

1038
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,599
we have to listen to them so i don't

1039
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,480
have to control that so

1040
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,720
erica said that okay i i understand but

1041
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,040
that's the reality i have to you know

1042
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,720
take it so well that's the nice thing

1043
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,440
about some of these other tools because

1044
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,599
you can integrate with the data without

1045
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,520
you know pull the data out that you need

1046
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,359
just work with it locally and then have

1047
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,040
it pushed back that would be that would

1048
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,319
be uh

1049
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,079
nice

1050
00:47:54,319 --> 00:48:00,480
jira is like sap you you you cannot work

1051
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,120
without it but you you

1052
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,319
you can

1053
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,839
[Music]

1054
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:05,839
you don't have to like it at all

1055
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,880
that is that is going to

1056
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,280
really get a lot of people's backs up

1057
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,280
saying saying saying jira is like sap

1058
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,000
i'm not gonna sit here and disagree with

1059
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,880
you

1060
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,040
uh

1061
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,359
but i think it's not quite as bad as sap

1062
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,240
he doesn't swear

1063
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,319
well

1064
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,240
yeah but probable prob that is actually

1065
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,839
probably true you're probably right

1066
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,520
because it's younger

1067
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,599
right um usually usually the younger the

1068
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,760
the newer the software the easier and

1069
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,240
simpler it is to use and the more it

1070
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,480
targets your specific use case

1071
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,240
um and i think there's definitely

1072
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,599
a trend

1073
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,240
towards

1074
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,040
smaller tools that integrate with each

1075
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,760
other

1076
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,920
rather than bigger tool vendors that get

1077
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,559
bogged down in

1078
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,440
as soon as as soon as one of these these

1079
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,800
folks get an enterprise customer

1080
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,240
as soon as they get an enterprise

1081
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,079
customer you suddenly see all these

1082
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,559
features for enterprise users that the

1083
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,920
rest of us couldn't care less about

1084
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,559
right that bog us down the the ad

1085
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,079
functionality or ad constraints

1086
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,559
one of my biggest complaints in

1087
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:21,760
microsoft teams right is that companies

1088
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,760
can lock down

1089
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,520
the way that their team members can use

1090
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,040
it so people come into my class and i

1091
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,280
teach all of my classes in microsoft

1092
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,800
teams and they're like i didn't know it

1093
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,960
could do this and i didn't know it could

1094
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,079
do that and how come i can use this

1095
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,359
feature

1096
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,240
right and that's because you're in my

1097
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,920
teams and i just turn everything on

1098
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,400
there's even i've got one customer it

1099
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,119
does make sense but they're the royal

1100
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,359
air force in the uk so it's the the the

1101
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,480
military and

1102
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:54,800
if everybody in a team's meeting

1103
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,359
is from their company

1104
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,559
right is their accounts then cameras are

1105
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,839
allowed as soon as one person joins the

1106
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,319
meeting

1107
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,839
that is not from the royal air force all

1108
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,359
the cameras turn off

1109
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,520
and they can't they're not able to turn

1110
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,680
them back on it's automatic

1111
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,760
right so that's a security feature

1112
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:17,040
but obviously somebody's asked for it

1113
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,960
and i bet i bet there's a company out

1114
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,000
there that has chosen to implement that

1115
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,400
feature that doesn't need it

1116
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,720
right i can understand why a military

1117
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,920
would need it if you're using webcams in

1118
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,599
the office

1119
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,000
right there might be something on the

1120
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:34,960
wall that you don't want people to see

1121
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,680
but you know

1122
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,359
an oil and gas company doing it

1123
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,160
doesn't necessarily make the same level

1124
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,079
of level of sense

1125
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,040
so one of the things that i think are

1126
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,319
really important in user stories and

1127
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,640
i

1128
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:53,200
i think this is this is a definitely an

1129
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,880
important caveat when we talk about user

1130
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,240
stories is that um user stories were

1131
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,200
developed

1132
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,559
and

1133
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,319
it's going to be a little bit weird way

1134
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,559
to say it

1135
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,960
by telling stories about how users

1136
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,520
interact with your system

1137
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,720
if users are not interacting with your

1138
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,200
system

1139
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,319
user stories are probably not the best

1140
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,319
solution to your problem

1141
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,319
okay

1142
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
if

1143
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,559
if you are if you are not

1144
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,160
describing

1145
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:31,280
users accessing your system

1146
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,200
then probably using user stories is not

1147
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,280
a good idea

1148
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,640
right if if if

1149
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,720
you're describing how apis interact

1150
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,280
because you're building an api that some

1151
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,839
development team hooks on to

1152
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,599
i don't expect to see user user stories

1153
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,440
in your backlog that is not going to be

1154
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,160
conducive to writing things in a way

1155
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,839
that everybody can understand it

1156
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,200
right that's why

1157
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,640
how many times is

1158
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,800
user story mentioned in the scrum guide

1159
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,280
does anybody know

1160
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,880
no it's zero

1161
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,480
user stories are not mentioned in the

1162
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,319
scrum guide story points are not

1163
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,200
mentioned in the scrum guide

1164
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,280
these things are not mandatory

1165
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,440
to be doing agile practices they're just

1166
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,680
things that have worked for other people

1167
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,200
and they've talked about

1168
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,599
right and they may work for us and they

1169
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,880
may not within our circumstance user

1170
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:27,599
stories have a particular use case which

1171
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:30,480
is describing interactions

1172
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,559
uh so here i've got a a user interface

1173
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,880
i'll just summon everybody to it

1174
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,880
um

1175
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,599
sean do you have a question

1176
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,280
uh i was looking at it and i saw it in

1177
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,400
the thing which says the acceptance

1178
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,800
criteria is optional and scrum

1179
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,800
will agree

1180
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
uh i just want to check

1181
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,079
what it what it says because sometimes

1182
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,800
we can

1183
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:11,119
definitely read the scrum guide in a way

1184
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,520
that inter that triggers our cognitive

1185
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,920
bias right we think it says something so

1186
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,920
hold on

1187
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,760
um

1188
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:27,359
acceptance criteria

1189
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,559
are definitely not mentioned in the

1190
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,920
scrum guide

1191
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,359
and they're not mentioned in the scrum

1192
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,880
guide because they have nothing to do

1193
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,119
with scrum

1194
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,920
you don't need to have acceptance

1195
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,160
criteria to be doing scrum you don't

1196
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,559
need to have user stories

1197
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,720
typically acceptance criteria

1198
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,960
generally are paired with user stories

1199
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,839
but not exclusively right having

1200
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,960
acceptance criteria a way of writing

1201
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,800
down and noting the conversations that

1202
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,960
we've had oh awesome we've got another

1203
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,839
visitor another helper

1204
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,240
um having those

1205
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,599
i we i couldn't hear uh

1206
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,640
i couldn't hear

1207
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,599
um so having having those uh uh

1208
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,240
conversations um so i do not believe

1209
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,800
that acceptance criteria are mandatory

1210
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,839
for anybody if you think they're a good

1211
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,960
idea and you think they add value to

1212
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,960
your team

1213
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,160
and add understanding

1214
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,839
use them

1215
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,680
if they don't

1216
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,760
don't

1217
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,119
okay

1218
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,240
how do we

1219
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,720
relate the

1220
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,800
acceptance criteria to the definition of

1221
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,160
done how wrong am i

1222
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:42,559
very wrong definitely very wrong uh so

1223
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,799
that that is a i i i common uh um

1224
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,760
a common conflation between those two

1225
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,480
things

1226
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,520
so

1227
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,680
acceptance criteria are to do with the

1228
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,280
requirements

1229
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,440
right acceptance criteria go on the

1230
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,640
requirements definition of done is about

1231
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,440
the quality

1232
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:03,280
of what it is you're creating so

1233
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:06,400
regardless of what it is that we deliver

1234
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,480
it all must meet the same quality level

1235
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,160
um but that's a really common one i

1236
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,520
actually spent probably an hour and a

1237
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,480
half today talking about that with

1238
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,400
product owners uh and i've got there's a

1239
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,040
if you want to dive a little bit more

1240
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,839
detail there's a recording of was it the

1241
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,000
definition of done workshop anna

1242
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:27,680
so there should be a recording on my uh

1243
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,599
um youtube channel uh with a definition

1244
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,640
of done workshop and we talked

1245
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,280
at length um about that specific

1246
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,119
scenario and we did uh an exercise some

1247
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,680
exercises around

1248
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:42,240
um creating a bakery

1249
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,319
right so we had erica's bakery

1250
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,760
and at erica's bakery we had uh some

1251
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,520
products that were creating and then we

1252
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,599
had a definition of

1253
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,280
it done and how we kept them separate so

1254
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,400
i would go watch that

1255
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,160
um

1256
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,000
it will hopefully

1257
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,640
we had one hour

1258
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,559
session offline just on that yeah yeah

1259
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,319
it's it's it's it's one of those things

1260
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,440
there are there are there are so many

1261
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,880
things

1262
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,079
that

1263
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,000
i i'm always surprised at the number of

1264
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,680
scrum trainers out there who have never

1265
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,040
read the scrum guide

1266
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,799
right

1267
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,640
and and get some of those things mixed

1268
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,799
up so it's not surprising everybody else

1269
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,799
does that's okay right

1270
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,520
um but we just need to figure out how do

1271
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,960
we how do we put those things uh

1272
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,960
together

1273
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,359
i spend more time talking about what's

1274
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,559
not in the scrum guide than what is most

1275
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,240
of the time

1276
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,079
right no you don't have to do it that

1277
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,000
way but the scrum guide says we should

1278
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,880
no it doesn't go look

1279
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,200
right

1280
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,240
um so

1281
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,160
uh

1282
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,040
i've got a little uh a picture here of

1283
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,440
up

1284
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,599
it's a recipe website

1285
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,280
right um i actually i i stole this from

1286
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,760
my good friend david starr again i think

1287
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:57,040
he did it at a conference uh but i have

1288
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,160
a recipe box and there's a list of

1289
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,000
recipes and you can enter ingredients

1290
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,760
sorry that's a recipe and you can add

1291
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,319
ingredients to the recipe and then you

1292
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,400
can add some notes for cooking

1293
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:11,200
right so it's it's fairly fairly fairly

1294
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,920
straightforward but if we were to start

1295
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,040
creating user stories one of the best

1296
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,319
places to start is to draw the user

1297
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,440
interface that you're going to talk

1298
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:23,599
about draw it on the whiteboard

1299
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,520
right what is this thing we're creating

1300
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,119
what does it look like

1301
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,119
and then you need to start having

1302
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,160
conversations about it

1303
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,720
right what are the things that we expect

1304
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,119
users to do with this

1305
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,559
uh so where's my where's my user stories

1306
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,480
there we go i have a couple of user

1307
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:43,599
stories down here

1308
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,119
so here's my um

1309
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:49,359
three user stories that i've created

1310
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,960
as a recipe seeker

1311
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:54,400
i want to search by tag values so i can

1312
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,480
find recipes

1313
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,359
ad hoc

1314
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,000
as a recipe recorder

1315
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,960
i want to tag my recipes so i can find

1316
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,680
them via ad hoc tags

1317
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,839
and as a recipe seeker i want to search

1318
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,760
by recipe ingredient

1319
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,720
so that i can find recipes for the

1320
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,720
ingredients i have

1321
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,799
all right so those are a bunch of

1322
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,160
different scenarios

1323
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:22,400
right there it's just

1324
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,720
definitely a limited s

1325
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,119
i can come up with about 10 more for

1326
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,599
that scenario for that page but

1327
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,440
is a limited set of scenarios

1328
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:36,359
but did you notice

1329
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,359
that it doesn't say as a user

1330
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,000
in these scenarios it gives the user

1331
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:45,440
purpose as a recipe

1332
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,480
seeker a recipe recorder

1333
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,240
there's two different personas

1334
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,920
there two different mission statements

1335
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,240
that that user has

1336
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,599
and on the left hand side i've got

1337
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,240
recipe recorder chef recipe seeker cook

1338
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,119
with existing ingredients

1339
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,880
right

1340
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,079
might be a a scenario be as specific as

1341
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,799
you can

1342
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,880
and i see in some organizations they

1343
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,200
might name a specific person if they're

1344
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,000
a known person within the organization

1345
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,400
right

1346
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,559
the cto wants something that they

1347
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,200
interact with or the cfo

1348
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,400
wants something and in other other

1349
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,160
groups

1350
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,400
microsoft

1351
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,760
used to have back in their waterfall

1352
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,240
days

1353
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,720
they used to have posters

1354
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,720
up on the wall in the offices with who

1355
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,079
the target users were for some of their

1356
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,400
products

1357
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:41,040
so you literally had a poster that had a

1358
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,280
picture of somebody um and it said their

1359
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,720
name ellen i think ellen

1360
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,480
ellen the

1361
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,920
something tester

1362
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,960
right so this is for microsoft test

1363
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,280
tools

1364
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,119
and it had a little story about ellen

1365
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,520
and who she was and what she was trying

1366
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,040
to do with the product

1367
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,799
so that

1368
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,280
the developers could connect

1369
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:03,280
empathetically to that story and get

1370
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,040
themselves into the mindset of ellen and

1371
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,880
what she's trying to achieve so when i'm

1372
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,119
building features i'm thinking about

1373
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,680
what does ellen need

1374
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,599
and this is the same here what does a

1375
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,520
recipe recorder okay so i'm in the

1376
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,720
mindset of i'm adding stuff to this

1377
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,000
system

1378
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:24,000
what do i need to to to be able to do or

1379
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:27,440
risk be seeker i'm looking for stuff

1380
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,839
right you're adding context there

1381
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,280
so not just the user that would be a

1382
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,960
very uh a

1383
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,839
cheap way to do it

1384
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,839
so you've got as a user

1385
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,280
some type specific

1386
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,400
i want

1387
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,160
what is it what's the user's goal

1388
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,720
right and then why do they want to

1389
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,200
achieve that goal

1390
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,079
because that might add some additional

1391
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,920
uh

1392
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:56,079
context to your story

1393
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,160
yeah so that's the typical makeup of

1394
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,920
some user stories there

1395
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,920
is that

1396
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,799
how you've seen them used

1397
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,799
or have you seen them differently

1398
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:15,920
anna is this what your user stories look

1399
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,920
like

1400
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,040
some of them some of them right

1401
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,119
not all

1402
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,720
i also like in the user story to have

1403
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,960
like the

1404
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,920
business purpose like while we are doing

1405
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,280
this

1406
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,200
maybe linking to some greater purpose

1407
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,240
yeah yeah like what do we want to

1408
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,640
achieve with this yep and then maybe

1409
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,119
it's nice to have this the the who the

1410
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,119
what the why yep and after that the

1411
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,240
acceptance criteria but there is no

1412
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,240
people to write that

1413
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:53,520
that's the problem yeah

1414
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:56,000
so so um

1415
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,640
this is not the whole thing

1416
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,839
but this is this is this is the user's

1417
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,480
story

1418
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,480
bit of the user story

1419
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,160
right when we think of user story as the

1420
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,079
thing we might have more stuff

1421
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,280
associated like each each if we were

1422
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:13,280
putting these each in jira right

1423
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,520
or gyra depending if you're in the u.s

1424
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,599
or europe right um

1425
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,119
then perhaps

1426
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,799
perhaps this image that we have

1427
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,599
of the user interface that we're

1428
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:28,559
creating it for is attached to those

1429
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,480
items to give them context

1430
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,559
right oh well i've got this specific

1431
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,079
thing okay but what's what's the context

1432
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,599
within which it's working well it's this

1433
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,200
is the user interface we're trying to

1434
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,200
create

1435
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,280
or this is the business proposition that

1436
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,880
we're trying to fulfill that's okay we

1437
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,119
can have that additional information

1438
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,839
that's going to add value

1439
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,960
right but the idea behind user stories

1440
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:53,520
is keeping it really simple and concise

1441
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,319
so that it encourages you

1442
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:59,119
to create more of them

1443
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:01,119
right lots of discrete elements that are

1444
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,280
very independent

1445
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,920
we didn't talk about it but um we

1446
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,480
usually try and encourage it's not

1447
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,599
perfect the invest

1448
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,359
model

1449
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,960
if you're not familiar with the invest

1450
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:16,640
model um

1451
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,720
your your things on your backlog

1452
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:22,240
it could be independent

1453
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,359
negotiable testable valuable estimatable

1454
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,640
and small

1455
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,760
i think i did that in the wrong order

1456
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,319
but there we go

1457
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,440
um i can't spell either so that solves

1458
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,119
that problem

1459
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,960
so we need to be they need to be small

1460
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,880
enough that we can do them small enough

1461
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,680
that we can estimate them right do we

1462
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:40,079
understand it enough to estimate it

1463
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,520
can we test it if we can't test it it's

1464
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,319
going to be very difficult to validate

1465
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,160
that we completed it or not is it

1466
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,000
negotiable

1467
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,000
none of these things are set in stone

1468
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,079
nothing on your backlog is set in stone

1469
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,960
it's about the future it's a description

1470
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,119
of the future we would like

1471
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,559
right but maybe the future we get needs

1472
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,760
to be different from what we would like

1473
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,359
to have

1474
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,079
and needs to be independent so we

1475
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:05,760
minimize dependencies

1476
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,280
so if you do have dependencies maybe it

1477
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,680
needs broken down into smaller things

1478
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:15,839
right and then the last one was valuable

1479
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,839
if it's not valuable don't build it

1480
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:19,359
right so understanding value is super

1481
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:21,920
important

1482
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:24,559
but what does value mean to

1483
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,720
your product owner to your business

1484
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,039
that's something that for example scrum

1485
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,400
is not going to tell you

1486
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,480
it's just not going to give you that

1487
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,799
answer there's lots of different ways to

1488
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,160
determine value

1489
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,680
but it's going to be unique to your

1490
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,680
business what does it mean to your

1491
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,680
business

1492
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:49,119
[Music]

1493
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,760
i think that one

1494
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:55,200
originally from uh it's called invest

1495
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,880
right yeah invest

1496
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,319
it's for the the an acronym that the

1497
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:03,200
letters spell uh i have a different uh

1498
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:04,160
view of that here let me grab this

1499
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,400
because

1500
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:08,480
um i was good i had it all set out to do

1501
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:12,160
a little workshop if we had lots of

1502
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,160
people turn up but sometimes

1503
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,760
he loves my workshops

1504
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,490
okay

1505
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,960
so yeah this is the the

1506
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:21,680
[Music]

1507
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,480
the way you would look at it

1508
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,559
negotiable valuable estimatable

1509
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,559
small and invest

1510
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,920
right and the idea is it's simple to

1511
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,680
understand

1512
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,799
um and the the other there's other

1513
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,359
options

1514
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:38,880
right uh i'm gonna gonna give you

1515
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:40,480
two other options that you can use

1516
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,079
at july

1517
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,319
nasa

1518
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,920
nasa has their model

1519
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:51,440
right their model is complete consistent

1520
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:55,119
correct modifiable ranked traceable

1521
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:57,760
unambiguous and verifiable

1522
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:00,079
but try explaining that to your mom

1523
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,640
that's going to be difficult isn't it

1524
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:07,119
right yes

1525
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,640
another one is the the ieee requirements

1526
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,119
ieee

1527
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,119
uh interfaces functional capability

1528
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,680
performance levels data structures and

1529
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,760
elements safety reliability security

1530
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,119
privacy quality constraints and

1531
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,359
limitations

1532
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:25,680
also super easy to understand not

1533
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,680
right

1534
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,839
we're not dealing with engineers all the

1535
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,920
time

1536
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,160
the engineers are not the only ones that

1537
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,200
have to understand the things on your

1538
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,880
backlog

1539
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,799
right the stakeholders need to be able

1540
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,960
to understand it the way the way i

1541
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,839
normally explain it

1542
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,960
is

1543
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,039
anybody who understands your product

1544
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,400
domain your business domain

1545
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,559
should be able to understand your

1546
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,520
backlog

1547
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,400
if your business domain is building apis

1548
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,640
right

1549
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,640
i would expect that level of complexity

1550
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:01,359
in your backlog if your business domain

1551
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,000
is building user interfaces right that

1552
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:07,599
that your average person can use

1553
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,599
then i would expect that level of

1554
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,359
understanding to be required to read

1555
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,960
them

1556
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,640
right because our stakeholders should be

1557
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,160
able to understand what it is we're

1558
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,839
creating

1559
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,039
because we're might be spending some of

1560
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:20,000
their money

1561
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,680
right

1562
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,799
you don't want to bamboozle them with

1563
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,599
with lack of understanding

1564
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,520
so

1565
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:30,559
that's just part

1566
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,400
of a user story do i have the the

1567
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,720
other thing that i wanted it's maybe not

1568
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,720
in here let me pop over here

1569
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,640
yeah

1570
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,599
so we start off

1571
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,559
um

1572
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:47,359
with our our our user stories so there's

1573
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:50,960
the three user stories that we had and

1574
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:53,039
then we start to have conversations

1575
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,280
right so if you think about this this

1576
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,799
this user interface

1577
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,640
here that i have

1578
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:00,400
you know when i click on the home page

1579
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,960
link

1580
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,960
what happens

1581
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,319
right

1582
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,880
can we can we sort the columns on this

1583
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,400
data grid

1584
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,920
is that a thing we're gonna do

1585
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,720
if there's if we don't enter any

1586
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,839
ingredients can you click the add button

1587
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,839
if so what happens

1588
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,799
right these are all

1589
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,560
business decisions they're not actually

1590
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,799
technical decisions

1591
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,040
the business should decide that

1592
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,679
yes the add button should be disabled if

1593
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,640
there's no text in there

1594
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:34,640
or

1595
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:36,719
does the add button enabled and we click

1596
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,719
it and it does a model dialog that says

1597
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,679
you have not entered anything click ok

1598
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,440
right because that would be really

1599
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,480
annoying

1600
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,239
yeah but

1601
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,799
you've we've all used interfaces like

1602
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,880
that haven't we

1603
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:51,279
that do things in a way that you're like

1604
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,600
why would you do it that way

1605
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,759
often it's because nobody thought about

1606
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:57,279
it and the person doing the work made

1607
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,920
the choice

1608
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:02,400
because nobody told them what the answer

1609
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,719
might be they don't have any way to ask

1610
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,040
user stories are trying to

1611
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,040
create that conversation so we start

1612
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,520
engaging with our stakeholders engaging

1613
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,920
with our business engaging with our uh

1614
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,279
product owners right

1615
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,719
what happens when you click the cancel

1616
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,719
button and you've got stuff filled out

1617
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,600
i've clicked cancel buttons and apps and

1618
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,759
it disappears and i'm like oh really you

1619
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,319
didn't ask me if i wanted to lose that

1620
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,319
information

1621
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,799
right

1622
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,799
simple stuff like that what happens

1623
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:38,799
right so here's a here's a one of one of

1624
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,520
those specific

1625
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:44,080
items as a recipe recorder

1626
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:49,239
i want to tag my recipes

1627
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:49,239
so i can find them via ad hoc tags

1628
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:54,239
right so then we've got some questions

1629
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,080
specific to this item

1630
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:57,199
does this happen when i'm entering the

1631
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,560
recipe

1632
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,159
like where the heck am i doing these

1633
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,719
tags

1634
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:06,640
what about really really big tags

1635
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,640
what's the maximum length of a tag

1636
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:11,520
what about short ones can i have a one

1637
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,520
letter tag is that okay

1638
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,199
right

1639
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,960
what about spaces how we're gonna handle

1640
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:20,400
spaces in this tagging system

1641
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,719
all right these are all questions that

1642
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,440
engineers will ask

1643
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,440
if you let them

1644
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,719
right sometimes they you need to wind

1645
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,320
them up to get them started but you'll

1646
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,239
you'll get these sorts of questions once

1647
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,600
you get people going in these events so

1648
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,920
then then

1649
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,600
do we just we could just write that

1650
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,400
write the answers the questions and the

1651
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,040
answers on the on the story

1652
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:47,520
but maybe these are a little bit too

1653
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,480
ambiguous

1654
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,640
for our engineers because we all know

1655
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:56,800
how engineers love specificity

1656
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,040
right i could see geelong's an engineer

1657
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,960
we like we like things to be bullying

1658
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,800
propositions i'm either doing it right

1659
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,600
or i'm not

1660
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,520
right

1661
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,520
and you you

1662
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,159
if you're a product owner

1663
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,840
you will get often maybe incredibly

1664
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:15,120
annoyed and frustrated with your

1665
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,880
engineers for being pedantic

1666
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,440
they're not being pedantic they just

1667
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,719
want to know the answer

1668
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,400
right do you want it this way or that

1669
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,360
way it should be a red button or a green

1670
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,880
button

1671
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,159
because that might be important to you

1672
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,159
right left hand side of the page or

1673
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,440
right hand side of the page well i just

1674
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:33,440
put it somewhere

1675
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,880
right but we're asking those questions

1676
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:39,280
because they're choices we have to make

1677
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,080
when we're building the product

1678
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:43,520
so here is two of those

1679
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,480
answers

1680
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,560
written as scenarios

1681
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,520
scenarios are a good way to write

1682
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:54,239
acceptance criteria that helps us

1683
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,719
be a little bit more specific on what it

1684
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,679
is we mean when it happens and how it

1685
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,360
happens

1686
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,640
so here we've got the three character

1687
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,280
minimum

1688
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:06,239
given a tag value of less than three

1689
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,880
characters when it is entered then it is

1690
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:11,520
not saved and the user is alerted about

1691
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,520
the tagline

1692
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:16,640
there's quite a lot of information in

1693
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,640
there isn't there quite a lot of answers

1694
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:23,440
right that's describing how it works

1695
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,960
describing the behavior of the product

1696
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,960
these are business cases

1697
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:33,199
given it yes

1698
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:37,199
it's also kind of related with the

1699
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:39,360
tester and the test cases

1700
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,080
so

1701
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,840
okay so one of one of the problems that

1702
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:46,320
we run into

1703
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,600
is that we end up testing quality in

1704
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,600
rather than building it in

1705
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,199
user stories and

1706
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,480
scenarios

1707
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:58,719
are about let's let's figure out upfront

1708
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:00,800
what the product is supposed to do

1709
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,880
because what what typically happens

1710
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,800
right i'll give you a typical thing

1711
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:09,120
is the developers go off and decide what

1712
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:11,360
they think the product should do

1713
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,440
the testers go off and decide what they

1714
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,679
think the product should do

1715
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:18,960
and then the testers run their tests

1716
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:22,239
against what the developers have done

1717
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,239
what typically happens

1718
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,280
right it doesn't doesn't doesn't match

1719
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,679
up

1720
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,440
so this this technique is around test

1721
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,600
first yes

1722
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,600
maybe you should have testers involved

1723
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,679
in these conversations and they're going

1724
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,719
to ask other conversations that a

1725
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,840
software engineer might not make

1726
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,600
yes

1727
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,280
yeah we're going to build these things

1728
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,719
together acceptance criteria

1729
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,880
right for me

1730
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,800
i guess being the the

1731
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,600
julong and i being the pedantic ones

1732
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,800
right

1733
01:13:53,600 --> 01:14:00,000
the the the the that acceptance criteria

1734
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,159
is the criteria by which you will agree

1735
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,480
that we've built what you asked for

1736
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:07,280
acceptance criteria on what basis will

1737
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,280
you accept this

1738
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,760
so if we if we can wiggle that

1739
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,760
acceptance one of my favorite acceptance

1740
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,480
criteria is from an exercise that i run

1741
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,400
for teams and it says be generally

1742
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,400
attractive

1743
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,159
for a website what the hell does that

1744
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,400
mean

1745
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,760
right be generally attractive well

1746
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,120
what's attractive for you what's

1747
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,560
attractive for me they're different

1748
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,960
things right i've used some

1749
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,040
i've built some god awful websites that

1750
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,719
i could say well okay i could agree it's

1751
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:41,080
generally attractive

1752
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,080
right it's not as ugly as it could be

1753
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,400
so what's the difference between

1754
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,400
acceptance criteria and scenario

1755
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,760
the way the way you write it

1756
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,000
though just the way you write it so an

1757
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,000
acceptance quite sepsis criteria i would

1758
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,920
normally see written as just bullet

1759
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,120
point statements

1760
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:02,880
yeah build point statements or

1761
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:06,480
checkpoints right um scenarios are

1762
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,480
let's take that bullet point statement

1763
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,239
and write it in a way that we're

1764
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,800
specifically seeing what behavior we

1765
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,800
want to see

1766
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,000
so one of the advantages of scenarios is

1767
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:20,080
there are a bunch of tools out there

1768
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,239
that can turn these into tests

1769
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,760
automatically not completely

1770
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,400
automatically we still have some work to

1771
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,040
do

1772
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,040
and but there's a spec flow i've used in

1773
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:31,760
the dot net world where you can write it

1774
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,920
like this and it generates the stubs for

1775
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,000
unit tests that then developers fill out

1776
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,480
the tests and if they pass we

1777
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,159
it does that

1778
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,000
right so there are tooling around that

1779
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,280
but even just having it written like

1780
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,199
this

1781
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,199
julong was looking about at this going

1782
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:50,560
yeah that's how i want it written

1783
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:52,320
so that i know what i need to build

1784
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,920
because again these are business

1785
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:55,840
decisions

1786
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,640
if you don't do that

1787
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,719
then

1788
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,719
who's going to decide what happens when

1789
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:02,159
you enter a tag of less than three

1790
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,320
characters but hit the save button

1791
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:06,239
anyway

1792
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,840
julong and i are gonna decide we're

1793
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:10,000
gonna build it however we think it

1794
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:14,960
should look

1795
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,960
but are these two scenarios also

1796
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,600
could be uh considered as true

1797
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:20,640
exceptional criteria

1798
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,640
yeah i

1799
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,600
i would say that that that's

1800
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,080
we're

1801
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:28,000
using a technique for writing acceptance

1802
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,800
criteria called scenarios that's the way

1803
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,800
i would look at it

1804
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:37,360
right so we can take our oh what's that

1805
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,800
one

1806
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,679
yeah okay

1807
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,360
so we can we take our our our

1808
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,960
user interface

1809
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,120
we draw it

1810
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,640
and then we start creating user stories

1811
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,040
and for each user story we start

1812
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,120
creating scenarios

1813
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,040
what happens if you had 10 scenarios on

1814
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,199
an user story

1815
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,800
you'd be thinking that's too big

1816
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,280
right that sounds like this is a really

1817
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,360
complicated thing maybe i want to break

1818
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,120
it down into two user stories maybe it's

1819
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,640
fine the way it is

1820
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,000
but it enables you to start building

1821
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,560
that out

1822
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,640
so the exercise that i do with teams to

1823
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,679
help them

1824
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,520
with this

1825
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,440
is i go i go through some kind of

1826
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,360
exercise like this where we're

1827
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,199
we talk about invest and we talk about

1828
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,880
scenarios and how you would write them

1829
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,520
right

1830
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,320
and then i get them to draw

1831
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:30,320
a user interface that already exists in

1832
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,520
their product

1833
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,520
so just draw something that already

1834
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:36,400
exists in your product

1835
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:40,080
build the user stories and scenarios you

1836
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:42,400
would have liked to have

1837
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:44,239
to build it correctly so you're using

1838
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,280
hindsight you already know what you had

1839
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:47,199
to do

1840
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,600
and you have you have everybody together

1841
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,920
that you need so product management

1842
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,719
developers testers who do you need to

1843
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,719
tell that story

1844
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,199
build out the user stories and scenarios

1845
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,400
and if you're you're running that with

1846
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,320
your team

1847
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,960
you can go around and you can poke at

1848
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:08,719
something and say you know i

1849
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:10,640
is that the right user there or um

1850
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,320
there's quite a lot of scenarios on that

1851
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,239
is this quite big how big do you think

1852
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,080
this is well it's ginormous okay you

1853
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:18,400
want to break it down into multiple user

1854
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,760
stories then you can encourage them to

1855
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,920
do that

1856
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,239
and then they end up with here's the

1857
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,760
level of detail

1858
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:27,760
that would have built

1859
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,640
the right thing

1860
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,400
that you ended up with

1861
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,640
right yes

1862
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,600
a lot of focus on what you said i mean

1863
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,560
it could be considered as epic

1864
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,640
and then

1865
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,080
it could be invited right yeah but it's

1866
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,679
just a picture

1867
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,679
yeah it's just it's just a picture and

1868
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,600
then you're you're breaking it down but

1869
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,920
then the second part of the exercise so

1870
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,800
once you've done that and they've you

1871
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,120
know um i guess in in in in britain you

1872
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,840
would say um and add you know they've

1873
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,320
kind of you've they've thought about how

1874
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,920
much details involved in this and how

1875
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,520
and they're like yeah yeah this is the

1876
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,600
right level of detail this would have

1877
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,760
answered all of those questions so you

1878
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,440
get them to to kind of review it and

1879
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,520
talk about it

1880
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,520
you send them off for lunch

1881
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,360
right and then when they come back

1882
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,719
because it's lunch time already right

1883
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,960
when they come back

1884
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,520
you you you

1885
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,520
get them to take a user interface of

1886
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,920
their product backlog

1887
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,199
something that doesn't exist yet in your

1888
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,880
product

1889
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:32,000
and you say right

1890
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,920
let's build some user stories

1891
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,520
let's break this down let's create

1892
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,520
something that we can

1893
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,520
understand what this thing is that we've

1894
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,199
made the business decisions that we need

1895
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,360
to make

1896
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,840
and they'll be surprised at how

1897
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,560
difficult one how difficult it is

1898
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:51,360
how much they don't know

1899
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,280
about the things on their backlog

1900
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,640
and then at the end once they've built

1901
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,480
all of that and they see how much is

1902
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,480
there you're like awesome this is how

1903
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,400
refinement works

1904
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,000
right this is exactly the type of level

1905
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,080
of detail you want to be coming out of

1906
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,760
refinement with to add to your backlog

1907
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,520
so that the teams can take it and go

1908
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,199
build it

1909
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,639
and it's a lot more work than people

1910
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,000
think it is

1911
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,679
right they think that you can just write

1912
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,360
something down give it to developers and

1913
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,040
then go build something but that never

1914
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:21,040
results in the right thing

1915
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:24,000
we've got to have more conversations and

1916
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,000
user stories

1917
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,960
uh uh a a statement

1918
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,360
a

1919
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,880
car sorry card

1920
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:38,000
a conversation and confirmation

1921
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,080
is how we start down that journey

1922
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,239
right if you think about the evolution

1923
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:44,159
of a user story

1924
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:46,880
you might put stuff on your backlog

1925
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:48,719
that's really far down with just a title

1926
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,520
like a little placeholder what's this

1927
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:53,440
thing it's attached to anna's business

1928
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,199
case right

1929
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,880
and you go oh here's all the things we

1930
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,480
don't really know what they are yet but

1931
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,679
here's all the things

1932
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:02,719
and then as they get closer to being

1933
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,560
done

1934
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,159
you know we the product owner goes in

1935
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,920
and goes right this is what that user

1936
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,920
story is and this is what this other one

1937
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,600
is maybe gets the team together and

1938
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,800
whiteboards out

1939
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:17,199
the ui so we attach the ui to it

1940
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,280
we've built out some user stories and

1941
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:22,400
then as it gets closer to the top of the

1942
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,639
backlog closer to being ready right

1943
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,320
we we then go in and we start talking

1944
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,320
about scenarios and build out the

1945
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:30,880
scenarios turning any acceptance

1946
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,880
criteria into scenarios having more

1947
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,960
conversations about it

1948
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,560
till that thing is ready

1949
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,760
and then we can walk into sprint

1950
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,239
planning

1951
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,880
and we know what that thing is we

1952
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,880
understand what the business problem is

1953
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,199
we're trying to solve how complex it is

1954
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,639
how many bells and whistles we need to

1955
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:50,719
have on it

1956
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,239
and then we as the engineers you know

1957
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:55,120
the team taking it on can then just

1958
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:57,760
worry about the implementation problem

1959
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:01,679
they're not doing the implementation and

1960
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:03,280
deciding all of the business choices

1961
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:04,239
just let's just do the business problem

1962
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,840
and then

1963
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,560
we can figure out if we built the right

1964
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,560
thing afterwards

1965
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:13,199
yeah but i also think that we should be

1966
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,360
careful and maybe have the input from

1967
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,760
developers because it might the user

1968
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,639
story be kind of big with a lot of

1969
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,679
scenarios but to be easy to develop

1970
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:23,600
like

1971
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:27,199
maybe we'll spend more time in writing

1972
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,520
it down instead of developing so um

1973
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:32,560
definitely a thing you have to figure

1974
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,400
out based on and this would be based on

1975
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,840
your team the product owner the business

1976
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:39,199
the context

1977
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,520
is how much detail do we need

1978
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:45,120
in our in our product backlog

1979
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,840
right and the scrum answer is as much as

1980
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,600
you need and no more because if you do

1981
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,360
too much like anna's saying it's waste

1982
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,000
right you oh you spent all this time on

1983
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,040
something that's very straightforward

1984
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,960
right so trying to find that balance

1985
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:06,560
yeah i think you you understand that uh

1986
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:08,320
i know by experience yeah experience

1987
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,480
both on the business side and

1988
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:13,040
development side it's easier because you

1989
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:17,120
know what the pro what the main problems

1990
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,120
are well of course book size

1991
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,639
yep at the beginning it will be

1992
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,760
complicated but

1993
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,880
and mock-up definitely

1994
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,000
works

1995
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,120
when

1996
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,120
drawing

1997
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,199
throwing something and

1998
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:33,040
making a stretch to

1999
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:35,199
to make everybody understand for example

2000
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,520
if it's something very new because

2001
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:40,000
it's easy to

2002
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:43,280
to understand for for the business side

2003
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,760
and well the developers know the the

2004
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:48,719
tricky parts and well it's up to the

2005
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,400
team and then to avoid discussing about

2006
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,600
that because it could be a strategy if

2007
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,000
uh if the development team is not is is

2008
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,040
trying to to sell to sell something to

2009
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,199
the

2010
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,159
to the to the customer but if in theory

2011
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:04,800
it's not the case if you're in a in a

2012
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:06,719
scram team so

2013
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,199
yeah and yeah i agree it comes with

2014
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,239
experience sometimes you'll do too much

2015
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:13,600
work

2016
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:15,120
and go oh that was actually super easy

2017
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,280
when we get something like that next

2018
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,040
time we'll not bother doing all that all

2019
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,719
that work yeah so there's going to be a

2020
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,400
little bit of waste at the smart start

2021
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,960
as but it's not really waste it's

2022
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:27,920
learning right we're learning at that

2023
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,800
experience but always be careful about

2024
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:33,600
the written words and i have a little a

2025
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:38,159
little example here just to to to drive

2026
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:42,360
that home um a little statement here

2027
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:42,360
that you might have seen on any menu

2028
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:52,239
i as an engineer

2029
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,239
don't know what that means

2030
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:58,679
i'll tell you why

2031
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,679
because it could mean this

2032
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:06,400
or

2033
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,400
it could be this

2034
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,920
couldn't it

2035
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:16,159
right the written word

2036
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,159
sucks for specificity

2037
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:24,080
i may or may not get bred with my choice

2038
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,080
depending on which one it is

2039
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,760
right

2040
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:31,440
yeah so so so take that take that into

2041
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,560
account

2042
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,000
right my favorite engineering joke

2043
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,639
julong

2044
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,360
is uh i'm gonna i i want you to go to

2045
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:44,960
the go to the local shop

2046
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:47,040
and i'd like you to buy a loaf of bread

2047
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,679
and if they have eggs

2048
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,679
buy six

2049
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,080
julong's laughing because he's gonna

2050
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,000
come back with six lots of bread if

2051
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,280
they've got eggs

2052
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,280
right

2053
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:03,199
because that's that's that's

2054
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,000
an exact interpretation of what was said

2055
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,440
and

2056
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,400
one of the reasons that a lot of

2057
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,560
engineers gravitated towards coding is

2058
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,199
because they have that mindset for

2059
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,960
direct interpretation rather than

2060
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,239
you know oh but i said it this way why

2061
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,440
didn't the computer do it well it's

2062
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,719
because you didn't actually see it that

2063
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,560
way you said it this other way because

2064
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,960
of the specificity

2065
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,880
so sometimes we want lots of specificity

2066
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,840
and sometimes it's okay for things to be

2067
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,000
vague

2068
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:30,000
but finding out where that balance is

2069
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,880
for your team for your context will be

2070
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,840
different

2071
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,719
uh

2072
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:38,080
and figuring it out is i think

2073
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:40,159
part of the fun of building products

2074
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,239
right it keeps it different every time

2075
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:43,600
you're doing something and that that

2076
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,920
um

2077
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,760
feeling of figuring it out is part of

2078
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,320
what makes a team

2079
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,760
gives them empathy with each other and

2080
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:56,159
uh

2081
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:56,159
builds that that amazing presence

2082
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,280
so

2083
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,159
also the unwritten user stories for

2084
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,159
example about the performance

2085
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:10,239
if something somebody from the business

2086
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:11,920
works for the first time or a project we

2087
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:14,560
would probably never ask about

2088
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:17,600
performance which is crucial

2089
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,840
so uh either the

2090
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:23,280
the development team the development

2091
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:26,239
experts asked ask you about

2092
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:28,000
performance or they they decide maybe

2093
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:30,880
they want to decide because the

2094
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,400
performance is normally

2095
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,880
the most one of the most complicated

2096
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:38,320
parts especially if the project is huge

2097
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,440
so uh the the business has to know

2098
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,880
that

2099
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,840
that he has to

2100
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,120
it has to to ask about uh performance or

2101
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,880
just or

2102
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:50,800
talk about performance yeah well it

2103
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,800
but it yeah that's definitely one of

2104
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,040
those things that the business very

2105
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:58,719
rarely asks about

2106
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:01,280
until they get it and performance sucks

2107
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:02,400
and by that time it can often be too

2108
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,960
late

2109
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:07,360
to fix some of the performance issues

2110
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,880
because they're endemic to the to the to

2111
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,800
the way the product's been architected

2112
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,440
and it's a big deal to change it yeah

2113
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,400
absolutely um and that that that for me

2114
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,840
is where

2115
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,960
conversations around definition of done

2116
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:21,040
come in

2117
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,040
right so we we have a conversation on

2118
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:26,080
what's the minimum level of quality we

2119
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,639
need and one of the questions on that is

2120
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:31,040
testing how much

2121
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:34,000
functional testing do we need this much

2122
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:36,880
what about performance testing oh

2123
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,760
okay every page must respond within

2124
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,520
you know

2125
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,679
500 milliseconds

2126
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,480
okay now we have a performance metric to

2127
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:46,560
how many users do we have to support

2128
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,600
oh as many as we like well we can't do

2129
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,360
that

2130
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,199
right we can't do as many as you like

2131
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,120
you have to pick a number and we're

2132
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:56,080
gonna measure based on that

2133
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,320
okay 200 simultaneous users awesome now

2134
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,760
i've got 200 simultaneous users 500

2135
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,719
milliseconds i can put that on my

2136
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,480
definition of done and run it as part of

2137
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:06,480
everything we do

2138
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,560
and then we'll always have that yeah

2139
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:12,320
yeah you gotta ask those questions

2140
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,719
and i've i actually um worked on a team

2141
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,880
where our performance test

2142
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:20,480
was everybody in the room opening the

2143
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:23,679
webpage and then somebody shouted go

2144
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:26,000
right to refresh or run the report and

2145
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,880
see how many people it could run at once

2146
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,280
yeah

2147
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:32,320
no automation whatsoever

2148
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,080
uh uh so that that you you want to be

2149
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,600
able to build all of those things into

2150
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:37,040
the

2151
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,440
into the solution but if you don't have

2152
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:42,400
the conversation

2153
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,080
you won't ask about it

2154
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:47,760
yeah i think that's why i

2155
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:49,520
i related the definition of that to the

2156
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,440
access requirements for me the

2157
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:54,400
acceptance requirements has

2158
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,840
a lot to do with crawl literally yeah

2159
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,199
one

2160
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,960
now i i understand your points it's uh i

2161
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:03,199
completely agree with you but i think

2162
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,199
that's

2163
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,960
the acceptance the acceptance criteria

2164
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,239
always has to be have to be

2165
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,120
something

2166
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:16,080
to do with the with the quality because

2167
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:20,120
without the quality the it's it's

2168
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,120
it's very difficult to

2169
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:25,040
go watch go watch the definition of done

2170
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:27,120
workshop because we we we talk about

2171
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,880
specifically talk about why having

2172
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,120
acceptance criteria on the definition of

2173
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:33,520
done is a bad idea

2174
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,679
it sounds like it would be a good idea

2175
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,199
sounds like it would be a good idea but

2176
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,679
it's actually a bad idea because it

2177
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:42,000
locks us into scope again we spent all

2178
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,080
this time in scrum trying to be flexible

2179
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,840
on scope but then we must meet

2180
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,040
acceptance criteria and suddenly we're

2181
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,440
locked into

2182
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:52,000
into scope again

2183
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:55,520
well we are we are uh pretty pretty

2184
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,960
close to uh at time

2185
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,280
um

2186
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,800
this was a little bit different format

2187
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,480
because we only had a few people we did

2188
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:05,199
a little bit of a different format where

2189
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:07,199
we we basically just talked for

2190
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:09,840
uh an hour and a half with some with

2191
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,360
some help in the mural so hopefully this

2192
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,520
was useful

2193
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:17,120
for you as well

2194
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:20,159
um if there's any uh feedback

2195
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:22,159
that you have i would love it to get any

2196
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:23,600
outstanding questions unanswered

2197
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,679
questions because we can have other

2198
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,639
sessions

2199
01:31:24,679 --> 01:31:31,840
not next week the week after next

2200
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:35,360
uh we have a session on daily scrum

2201
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:37,600
that anna is going to going to lead i

2202
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,520
have seen some of the early early

2203
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,800
workshop ideas and it looks pretty

2204
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:44,159
pretty good

2205
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:46,719
um so the idea is to to hit some of the

2206
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:48,000
events in scrum and how they would work

2207
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,000
i think we did

2208
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,440
did we do sprint planning or did we did

2209
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,080
sprint review i think we did sprint

2210
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:58,480
review didn't we yeah and we did sprint

2211
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:01,520
review before uh so we're gonna

2212
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:03,280
yeah you want planning on the list anna

2213
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,400
yeah we can definitely put planning on

2214
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:07,040
the list

2215
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:09,920
uh to have a a discussion around

2216
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,920
planning and how it how it how it might

2217
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:13,040
we might make it more effective that's

2218
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:14,800
always

2219
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,719
um

2220
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,639
a whole point the whole point of the

2221
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:20,159
scrum master is to help make everything

2222
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,239
more effective

2223
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:24,560
our working together

2224
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:26,400
our delivery of software make everything

2225
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,679
more effective

2226
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,360
so

2227
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:34,239
i am very tired i have spent four days

2228
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:36,480
this week full days training

2229
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:39,120
from nine till five so my brain is

2230
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,639
pretty much dead

2231
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,159
um

2232
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:45,360
are there any uh

2233
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:46,719
questions before oh ebm is on the list

2234
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:50,560
and nexus

2235
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,480
oh yes the elephant in the room scaling

2236
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,320
if you've been me yeah yeah if you've

2237
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,080
been following my linkedin i think i've

2238
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,920
been pooping all over skate scaling

2239
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,280
frameworks recently along with some

2240
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,400
other folks but

2241
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,719
um

2242
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:05,040
there are definitely things that can

2243
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,800
that we can do in scaling to help be

2244
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,480
more effective so we could definitely

2245
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,520
have a scaling talk

2246
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:13,920
in fact uh for why so today

2247
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:17,360
marking and since you have so many uh

2248
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,800
exercises that we didn't do maybe you

2249
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:25,120
can have the second workshop regarding

2250
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:28,080
story oh well that's that's interesting

2251
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:29,520
yeah i think that is just a waste if you

2252
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,440
don't use this

2253
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,120
exercise i found they are very

2254
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,880
interesting i mean you might need to

2255
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,880
continue to do that right people

2256
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,760
some of them yeah

2257
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:44,080
another we got our visitor back

2258
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,400
some of them like the like the circuit i

2259
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,520
i had a an invest

2260
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,480
circuit

2261
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:53,280
um you kind of you kind of need at least

2262
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:55,280
er er er three or four groups for that

2263
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,400
so we really didn't have enough people

2264
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,480
um but

2265
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,000
we had lots of interesting conversations

2266
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,840
which i think is

2267
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,400
well i think is still valuable so what

2268
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:07,199
else did we put on the list sprint

2269
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:09,280
planning technic manage technical debt

2270
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:11,040
with scrum

2271
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:14,159
hmm

2272
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:14,159
that's an interesting one

2273
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,400
in theory it doesn't exist but

2274
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,840
so

2275
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,040
sure but

2276
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,840
yeah

2277
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,639
i

2278
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,400
remember

2279
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,199
workshop i heard

2280
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,040
you

2281
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,880
i think it was

2282
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,040
organized by boston

2283
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,360
the boston agile community

2284
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:35,440
which you you talk you talk

2285
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,960
yes i did i did

2286
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,360
to know something more about that

2287
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,360
because i thought i found your

2288
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,520
your idea very interesting

2289
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,760
i don't even remember what i talked

2290
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,679
about i don't even remember the topic to

2291
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,960
be honest

2292
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,960
but i remember doing it

2293
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:55,040
what was the topic

2294
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:58,639
i think it was

2295
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:02,239
talking about the development uh

2296
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,760
in devops okay yeah what was it yeah

2297
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:06,239
okay

2298
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:08,239
it was a couple of years ago maybe i

2299
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:11,520
don't think it was that long ago i think

2300
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:15,040
it just seems i'm pretty sure it was

2301
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:16,880
this calendar year

2302
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:18,800
boston agile

2303
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:22,320
martin i think you would that'll

2304
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:24,000
probably not get it but we'll see oh

2305
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:28,000
uh

2306
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
agile boston ah yes i did i did the

2307
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,800
enterprise transformation that shows

2308
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,760
that you can too

2309
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,760
that's what i did

2310
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,320
it was in june this year it was in june

2311
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:43,360
this year

2312
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,920
yeah june this year lock down

2313
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,040
means we have no idea about time anymore

2314
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,080
it's just

2315
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,239
gone

2316
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,760
yeah yeah not this year for sure last

2317
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:55,400
year totally

2318
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,400
so um

2319
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:02,639
no no 21

2320
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:02,639
june 2021 i have it here

2321
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:09,040
really yeah yeah really

2322
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:10,800
i just put i just put the link to it in

2323
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:14,080
the

2324
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:16,800
here's the link to it on agile boston

2325
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,920
yes i thought it was this year

2326
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:23,280
right um but anyway i have copies of

2327
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:26,320
that uh same presentation that i've done

2328
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,560
on my youtube channel um and i think

2329
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,760
there's four or five different versions

2330
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,360
because i've done it at a number of

2331
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,840
conferences around the world and they've

2332
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:36,560
recorded it and i've also done it

2333
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,239
just online um but it's telling for for

2334
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:41,040
those that don't know it's telling um

2335
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:43,280
the microsoft azure devops story of how

2336
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,440
they transitioned to agility

2337
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,280
and and all of the things that they had

2338
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,639
to consider and change

2339
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,719
um so

2340
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,800
i don't remember i think i had an hour

2341
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,760
and a half for this one so i had plenty

2342
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,360
of time

2343
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,800
but sometimes people give me like half

2344
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,480
an hour for that half an hour's not

2345
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,840
enough for that talk you get through

2346
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:04,560
about a quarter of the content uh but uh

2347
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:06,960
yeah so that's that's quite a good

2348
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,840
that's quite a good story um and yeah i

2349
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,080
i

2350
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:12,000
if you have a specific thing from that

2351
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,239
story you want you want to do a workshop

2352
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,239
on we can definitely do that

2353
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:19,880
but there's a lot of things in it a lot

2354
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:19,880
of things in it

2355
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,199
some of the topics so you you introduce

2356
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,440
there because they're super interesting

2357
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:30,320
if you if you pick the topics we can put

2358
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,320
them on the backlog

2359
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:36,719
of that the how you manage the technical

2360
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:39,119
but i i i remember you talked about uh

2361
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,040
uh an overlap but not an overlapping

2362
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:43,360
screens but it's a

2363
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,119
to a pool dedicated to the technical

2364
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,520
debt but you didn't expect you didn't

2365
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:49,360
have the time yeah we were

2366
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,600
you're you're you're you're right and it

2367
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:53,840
was like it was less just technical debt

2368
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,800
but it was the the um

2369
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,920
uh

2370
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,800
sre

2371
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:01,119
so site reliability engineering

2372
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,400
is a technique that was developed at

2373
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:04,320
google

2374
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,239
um originally developed at google but

2375
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,639
microsoft have adopted it and changed it

2376
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:10,080
slightly for their for their world

2377
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:12,480
um but the way

2378
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,159
they do it was they had dedicated

2379
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,880
members of the team

2380
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:18,320
who were the site reliability

2381
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,639
development

2382
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,480
engineers some they had some and that

2383
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:23,280
crazy an acronym for it

2384
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,639
um

2385
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:28,880
but they effectively had a dual role of

2386
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:32,560
delivering from the sre

2387
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:35,280
backlog so the live site issues

2388
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,800
backlog dealing with live site issues so

2389
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,960
that you protected the team so they

2390
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,960
could focus on value and then that

2391
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:43,280
rotated through the team

2392
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,840
so that you didn't have one person

2393
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:48,719
annoyed at that yeah that's that's i

2394
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,600
actually erica if you look on

2395
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,639
um my youtube channel i think i've got a

2396
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,600
talk

2397
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,040
just on that topic from that team

2398
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,520
ah perfect

2399
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:01,920
i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure i've got

2400
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,639
one on my youtube channel

2401
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:08,159
thank you if i don't let me know and i

2402
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:08,159
can make you make you one

2403
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:16,560
last question yes

2404
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:18,560
any advice how we should deal with um

2405
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,719
with receive tickets from customers

2406
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:24,159
because for sure they will not have this

2407
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:27,040
structure of the users

2408
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:29,760
so that this mean that

2409
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:32,000
each ticket should be reworked

2410
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,000
or

2411
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:37,840
so that that is

2412
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:41,840
i i would probably not want tickets from

2413
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:43,760
customers going directly on my backlog

2414
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,520
i as a product owner i'm going to look

2415
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:48,000
at that those tickets

2416
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,840
and because there's a there's if that

2417
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,199
ticket goes directly on my backlog

2418
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:57,119
there's an assumption that i'm doing it

2419
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:58,639
and i might choose not to do it

2420
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,960
okay there might be something the

2421
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:04,159
customer says i really need this to work

2422
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,239
this way or i think you've delivered a

2423
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:08,400
broken product when in actual fact we

2424
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,600
it's the way we built it is deliberately

2425
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,480
that way

2426
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,040
or

2427
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:15,280
um they they have a bug

2428
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,520
but it only affects one customer it's a

2429
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:20,480
big deal to fix

2430
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:23,199
maybe maybe it's not worth our time and

2431
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:25,119
effort to fix right

2432
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:26,239
so so i don't want to have that

2433
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:27,520
assumption

2434
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:30,400
but i think

2435
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,560
having a place where i can see all of

2436
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:35,760
the user tickets and then break them

2437
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,960
down into things that go on my backlog

2438
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,280
i'm

2439
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,119
i'm pretty good with that

2440
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:43,119
um but i don't want i definitely don't

2441
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:45,679
want a one-to-one relationship because

2442
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:47,520
one user ticket might turn into five

2443
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:48,800
backlog items or

2444
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,400
you know

2445
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,320
it could be it could be

2446
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:55,119
various things that that it doesn't have

2447
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:56,800
to be a one-to-one relationship

2448
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:59,520
maybe i don't know

2449
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,800
what what are you doing just now

2450
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,400
one to one

2451
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,400
and what about if they're really really

2452
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,400
big

2453
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,560
specific official system for

2454
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,639
receiving these tickets we have two

2455
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,119
because

2456
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:17,760
but uh in jira we can split in different

2457
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:20,080
one and just relate them well yeah

2458
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:22,800
that's that's that's okay so the way

2459
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,119
i've seen so microsoft for a while used

2460
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:27,520
uh user voice

2461
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:30,639
right so not just tickets so user voice

2462
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:32,639
was for not for support tickets but for

2463
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,800
uh i would like

2464
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,400
right the customers desirements could go

2465
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,760
on user voice and everybody could vote

2466
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,360
on them and then they would filter the

2467
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,480
ones that they wanted you to do into the

2468
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,360
system

2469
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,400
and they have a separate support ticket

2470
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,239
system

2471
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,639
uh that i think probably does the same i

2472
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:50,719
mean it ends up on somebody's list and

2473
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,920
then it's approved to go into the team's

2474
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,040
backlog

2475
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,560
um

2476
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,320
yeah yeah

2477
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,320
because

2478
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,719
it also depends on the vision for the

2479
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:03,040
product so not every requirement should

2480
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:06,960
be accepted yeah

2481
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:08,480
well thank thanks uh uh you long

2482
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,639
good to see you again

2483
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:12,880
yeah see you next time thank you

2484
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:17,119
thank you bye

2485
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:18,800
so so yeah i i i i i agree and if if

2486
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:21,280
it's working for you and it doesn't get

2487
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,880
too overwhelming then that's okay but i

2488
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,840
can imagine

2489
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:27,679
if if your product has a lot of users

2490
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,000
and you get a lot of tickets it could be

2491
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:32,639
somewhat overwhelming having the tickets

2492
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,520
coming in like that

2493
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:37,840
yeah we kept that okay yeah the backlog

2494
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,000
is huge so

2495
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:43,040
but yeah we'll see how we're gonna do

2496
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,719
remember lean inventory control for your

2497
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,320
back clock

2498
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,639
right if you've got too many things on

2499
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,800
your product backlog the product owner

2500
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,040
can't know everything so if their

2501
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:55,520
accountability is maximizing the value

2502
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,920
it can be very difficult to find it

2503
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,679
right like a needle in a haystack

2504
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,840
right where where's the value i don't

2505
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,360
know because there's 5 000 things in the

2506
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:07,199
product back clock

2507
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:07,199
um so definitely

2508
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:12,159
apply some sort of lean inventory

2509
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:14,800
control

2510
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:17,360
right you want a minimum stuff in there

2511
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:19,520
but just what you need maybe what you've

2512
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:22,159
got is what you have to have

2513
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,560
right but maybe it could be less

2514
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:26,639
easier to understand or

2515
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,960
yeah i don't like the idea of having two

2516
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:30,719
backlogs but i also like the idea of

2517
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,800
having too many things in one backlog

2518
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,040
less

2519
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,480
so maybe triage

2520
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:38,800
yeah

2521
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:40,960
yeah triash

2522
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,199
because there might be some duplicates

2523
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,159
also

2524
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,600
yeah

2525
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:47,040
and then it's hard once the duplicates

2526
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,360
get into your back club because now it's

2527
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:51,280
polluted

2528
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:54,239
yeah and trying to trying to find them

2529
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:56,480
afterwards as a nightmare

2530
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,480
yeah

2531
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,639
you're very welcome anna

2532
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,920

so uh will we wrap it up there

2534
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,480
and

2535
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:09,119

2537
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:13,119
