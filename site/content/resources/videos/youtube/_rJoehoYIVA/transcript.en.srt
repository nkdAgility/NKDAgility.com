1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,640
there are lots of reasons why companies

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,519
come to us to help them with an Azure

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,080
devops migration um mostly it's

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,639
knowledge so we've done a lot of

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,880
migrations I've done hundreds of

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,039
migrations I've done um migrations up to

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,080
Azure devops I've done upgrades to

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,560
servers over the years beta servers

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,599
included um I've written code to move

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,920
data in a custom way from one

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,879
environment to another environment and

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,719
I've written an support code that allows

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,680
you to standardize that process as well

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,280
so the main reasons that that that

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,399
companies come to us is uh we've got a

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
department or a product that we've sold

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,960
to somebody else so we need to get it

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,079
out of the rest of our stuff and move it

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:02,280
over here that's one um we created one

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,879
big project um I think I coined the term

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,080
many many years ago one project to rule

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,360
them all right so they created one

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,640
massive project um and they actually

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,960
realized that they need to split it into

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,560
two so take one thing and split into two

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
or they created 20 projects and they

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,960
realized that they're all interconnected

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,720
and they should all be in one one bucket

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
um those are probably the main ones I've

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,960
sold part of my company I created too

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,720
many things and I want less things I've

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,360
created uh not enough things and I want

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,320
more things so moving that that data

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,320
around um but

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,040
also we we don't know what to do right

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,920
we this is our current state of what

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,040
we've got we want this how do we get

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,040
from here to there because it is really

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
complicated to do some of the migrations

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,960
and upgrades that people want really

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,240
depending on their context um so we do a

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,039
lot of migrations where there's many

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,119
many steps to get all the way to Azure

44
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,280
devops because the servers that they

45
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,160
environments are on are crusty and old

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,840
and that's the best reason to do it

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,480
right if if your servers and your

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,879
environments are crusty and old then

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,879
your teams that support them are not

50
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,680
able to support them right um so you

51
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,160
don't want to be running them yourself

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,160
you certainly don't want to be running

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,239
all of your Cod your organizational

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,640
asset which is your code um in a in a a

55
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,159
crusty falling apart barely

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,720
functions uh doesn't get any support

57
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,360
anymore right because the environments

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,400
are old um version of of anything um so

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
if you can get it get it up to the cloud

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,360
get it into that um fully supported

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,879
fully maintained environment where in

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,159
this case Microsoft do all the updates

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,760
do all they take it Forward they

64
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,519
engineer the proc product they do the

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,840
support and maintenance and uh load load

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,680
and everything Disaster Recovery just

67
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,840
everything they take care of it um and

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,920
it cost you what $4 per user per month

69
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,959
to get that it's a total no-brainer um

70
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,959
so getting up to the cloud doing those

71
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,239
things um we've also done a lot of

72
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:27,120
migrations from TFS to git um from G to

73
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,319
TF sorry GitHub GitHub TFS to GitHub

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,360
GitHub to TFS um I even did migration

75
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,840
once from Azure devops to TFS I assume

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
somebody in the

77
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,000
organization went without permission and

78
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,200
took all the stuff up to your devops and

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,319
there's no way back from Microsoft's

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:49,640
perspective um so yeah there's loads of

81
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,640
reasons why companies ask me to do

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,840
migrations some of them are good reasons

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,480
some of them are not so good reasons and

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,439
sometimes we we'll we'll push back quite

85
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,079
heavily and say look the this is not I I

86
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,519
get a lot of calls for backup right you

87
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,519
don't need to back up as your devops

88
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,360
Microsoft back it up for you they have

89
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,720
Disaster Recovery they have copies off

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,560
the tape they have all of that stuff for

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,840
you and they're all the isos compliant

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,440
for uh uh uh uh the level of recovery

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,160
that that that you're you're paying for

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,600
so there's no need for you to do that so

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,520
we push back really heavily on that but

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,039
we've also done it because the customer

97
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,560
really insists that they want want a a a

98
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:37,080
backup and sometimes you're you're

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,600
you're going to do that um so there's

100
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,199
lots of good reasons lots of bad reasons

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,080
to move data around and is your devops

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,919
um but it's irrelevant people want stuff

103
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,560
done the way they want it done um and

104
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,080
sometimes you need to do that and uh

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,080
yeah we help them out doing that
