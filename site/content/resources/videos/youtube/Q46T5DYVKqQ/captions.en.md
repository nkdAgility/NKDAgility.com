Empiricism is an interesting beast. Ultimately, empiricism is this idea that all knowledge comes from observable data. Right? That's science, is based on empiricism, and it's been adopted into the agile way of working and many other ways of working in business. 

That really, you should have access to all of the data. You should make deliberate actions that you think will affect the data, and then you monitor the data to see whether those outcomes have actually come to pass. 

And then you repeat that experiment a bunch of times, and if you are able to repeat it and successfully get the same outcome, then it's probably a thing that you should be doing. Otherwise, it might just be something that worked that way for one time.
