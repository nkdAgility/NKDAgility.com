00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:09,480
empiricism is an interesting uh Beast

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,620
ultimately empiricism is this idea

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,839
um that all knowledge comes from

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:21,199
observable data right that's that's

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:24,960
Science is based on empiricism and it's

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,699
been adopted into the agile way of

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,920
working and many other ways of working

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,720
in business that really you should have

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,360
access to all of the data you should

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,180
make deliberate actions that you think

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,100
will affect the data and then you

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
monitor the data to see whether those

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,780
outcomes have actually come to pass and

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,460
then you repeat that experiment a bunch

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,260
of times and if you are able to repeat

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,760
it and successfully get the same outcome

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,100
then it's probably a thing that you

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,780
should be doing otherwise it might just

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,440
be something that worked that way for

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,440
one time
