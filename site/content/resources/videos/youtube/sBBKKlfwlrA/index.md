Scaling Scrum: Overcoming Challenges with the Scaled Professional Scrum Course

As someone who has navigated the complexities of scaling Scrum, I can tell you that the journey is both rewarding and fraught with challenges. The Scaled Professional Scrum (SPS) course is designed to equip you with the skills necessary to tackle these challenges head-on. In this post, I want to share my insights and experiences from this hands-on, activity-based course, which has proven invaluable for teams looking to expand their Scrum practices.

### The Need for Scaling

Even after achieving success with Scrum, many teams find themselves constrained by the volume of work they can handle and the value they can deliver. This is where scaling becomes essential. When you scale, you’re not just adding more teams; you’re creating a cohesive unit of Scrum teams working collaboratively on the same product. However, this transition is not without its hurdles.

### Common Challenges in Scaling

When scaling Scrum, teams often encounter several common challenges:

- **Cross-Team Dependencies**: As teams grow, so do the interdependencies between them. Managing these dependencies effectively is crucial for maintaining momentum.
- **Self-Management**: Ensuring that teams remain self-managing while coordinating with others can be a delicate balance.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: With more teams involved, maintaining transparency and accountability becomes increasingly complex.

Many organisations turn to heavyweight scaling methodologies in an attempt to address these issues. However, I’ve seen firsthand how this can lead to added overhead that distracts teams from the core principles and benefits of Scrum.

### The Nexus Framework

The SPS course builds on the Nexus framework, which is specifically designed to help teams scale effectively without losing sight of Scrum’s essence. Throughout the course, we explore complementary practices and techniques that have been proven to help teams overcome the challenges of scaling.

### Interactive Learning Experience

One of the standout features of the SPS course is its interactive, activity-based format. Delivered over half-day sessions via Microsoft Teams and Mural, students engage in a simulated scaled product development project. This hands-on approach allows participants to apply what they learn in real-time, fostering a deeper understanding of how to launch, structure, organise, and manage large agile projects using Scrum.

### A Toolbox of Techniques

By the end of the course, students leave with a comprehensive toolbox of techniques for identifying and overcoming common scaling challenges. We present over 50 practices that can be immediately applied to your work, ensuring that you’re not just learning theory but gaining practical skills that can drive real change.

### Continued Learning and Support

To maximise the learning opportunity, we provide additional reading, writing, and watching activities between sessions. This ensures that the classroom experience is complemented by ongoing engagement with the material. After the course, students gain access to a community of peers and continued support from trainers through office hours and quarterly catch-ups.

### Certification and Beyond

As part of the course, students receive a password to take the globally recognised SPS certification exam. If you don’t pass on your first attempt within 14 days, we offer a second chance as part of our commitment to validated learning. Additionally, participants benefit from a 30-minute learning review, a one-hour coaching session, and a 30% discount on future courses.

### Conclusion

Scaling Scrum is a journey that requires dedication, knowledge, and the right tools. The Scaled Professional Scrum course provides all of this and more, empowering teams to overcome the challenges of scaling while staying true to the agile principles that drive success. If you’re ready to take your Scrum practice to the next level, I encourage you to consider this course. Together, we can navigate the complexities of scaling and unlock the full potential of your teams.
