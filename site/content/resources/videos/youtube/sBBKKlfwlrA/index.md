 The Scaled Professional Scrum is a hands-on, activity-based course where students develop a collection of skills that can be applied to overcome challenges when scaling Scrum. Even after achieving success with Scrum, teams are still limited by the amount of work they can do and the value they can create. They need to expand, or scale, to a group of Scrum Teams working together on the same product. When doing so, they often encounter common challenges with cross-team dependencies, self-management, transparency, and accountability.
