00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,049
The Scaled Professional Scrum is a hands-on,
activity-based course where students develop

2
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:11,760
a collection of skills that can be applied
to overcome challenges when scaling Scrum.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
Even after achieving success with Scrum, teams
are still limited by the amount of work they

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,060
can do and the value they can create. They
need to expand, or scale, to a group of Scrum

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,349
Teams working together on the same product.
When doing so, they often encounter common

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,900
challenges with cross-team dependencies, self-management,
transparency and accountability.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:42,730
When introducing heavy-weight scaling methodologies,
teams often find that the added overhead slows

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,144
down the teams and distracts from the essence
and benefits of Scrum. Instead, the Nexus

9
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:48,144
Framework minimally extended the Scrum Framework
to include ways that help solve the dependency

10
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:49,144
and collaboration challenges of cross-team
work. Since Nexus enhances the foundational

11
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:50,144
elements of Scrum, it reinforces the benefits
of Scrum while also being familiar to those

12
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:51,144
that have used Scrum.

13
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:52,510
The Scaled Professional Scrumâ¢ (SPS) with
Nexus course, builds on the Nexus framework

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,640
by introducing complementary practices and
techniques proven to help teams scale. The

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,960
course also includes a free attempt at the
globally recognized Scaled Professional Scrum

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,440
(SPS) certification exam.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,830
Our training is delivered as an interactive,
activity-based course over half-day sessions

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,430
using Microsoft Teams, and Mural. Students
work together in a Nexus to organize and simulate

19
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,050
a scaled product development project. This
case study-based class presents common challenges

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,460
in scaling and more than fifty practices for
overcoming them are revealed. Students will

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,750
develop an understanding of how to launch,
structure, organize, and manage a large Agile

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:44,920
project using Scrum. They will leave the class
with a toolbox of techniques for identifying

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,860
and overcoming common scaling challenges.
Between sessions, we provide additional reading,

24
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,890
writing, and watching activities to maximise
the learning opportunities and complement

25
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,659
the classroom experience.

26
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:04,130
After the conclusion of the class, we provide
access to a community of peers and continued

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,390
access to the trainer through office hours,
quarterly catchups, and constant engagement.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,660
To maximise validated learning, all students
are given a password to take the SPS assessment,

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,480
and if they take it within 14 days and are
unsuccessful, they will be granted a second

30
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,660
attempt. As part of our validated learning
experience, we provide a 30-minute learning

31
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,319
review, a 1h coaching session, and access
to future courses at a 30% discount on future

32
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,469
classes.
