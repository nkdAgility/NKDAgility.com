Why isn't the Scrum Master given any real power or authority in the Scrum Guide? What's the thinking behind that? 

So, but they are. They are given accountability over the effectiveness of the team. In Scrum, the Product Owner isn't really given any power or authority apart from the accountability for maximising the value of the work done. Right? The developers aren't given any authority apart from maximising the quality of the product that they're working with. 

So, the Scrum Master has the same type of accountability assigned to them that they need to figure out, without that explicit authority, how to create an environment within which the Scrum team can be as effective as possible. 

And that generally is the way that most things happen within organisations. Right? Most things in organisations don't happen through authority. Authority is used for escalation. Right? Something's screwed, escalated up, somebody says make this choice. It doesn't matter if it's the right one or not, but go this way. Right? That's that escalation point. 

But a Scrum Master is a leader. Right? And leaders, while in some contexts, yes, leaders get authority and they may have authority as well, but people need to choose to follow them. People need to want to do the things that the Scrum Master is suggesting because they're helping, because people see value in the things that they're doing. 

And that takes real skill. Right? It's not you as a Scrum Master. You need to understand the processes, practices, and tools. Right? What is it that the teams that you're working with are actually doing? Right? What's their context of their technical environment? What's the context of the business environment? Because you're going to be helping the Product Owner. 

And what's the context of the organisation as a whole? And figure out how do I increase the effectiveness of the teams going forward. 

So, while they don't necessarily have any real power or authority, they can gain that power and authority through people looking to them for guidance. They're providing value to people. If you provide value to me, I'm going to listen to the things that you have to say because I've listened to you in the past. You provided me with value; I got a success out of it. 

Therefore, if I'm unsure or I need more information, I'm going to perhaps come to you because I respect you. I respect your opinion. I respect the information that you have. I respect the value you provide me. And that's how a Scrum Master makes changes in an organisation.
