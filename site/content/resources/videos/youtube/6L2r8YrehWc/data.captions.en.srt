1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,679
why isn't the scrum Master given any

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,480
real power or authority in the scrum

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,480
guide was thinking behind that

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,840
so but they are they are given they're

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,779
given accountability over the

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,019
effectiveness of the team

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,060
in in scrum the product owner isn't

8
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,859
really given any power or authority

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,840
apart from the accountability for

10
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,540
maximizing the value of the work done

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
right the the developers aren't giving

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,219
in giving any Authority apart from

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,280
um

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,160
um maximizing the the the the quality of

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,120
the product that they're working with so

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,780
the scrum master has the same type of uh

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:59,579
accountability assigned to them that the

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,620
the they need to figure out without That

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,579
explicit Authority

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,579
how to

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,520
create

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,119
an environment within which the scrum

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,780
team can be as effective as possible

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,759
um and that generally is the way that

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,820
most things happen within organizations

26
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,880
right most things in organizations don't

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,100
happen through authority authority is

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,820
used for escalation right something

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,380
screwed escalated up somebody says make

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,119
this Choice doesn't matter it's the

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,500
right one or not but go this way right

32
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:45,720
that's that escalation point but a scrum

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,659
Master is a leader right and leaders

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,520
while in some context yes leaders get

35
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,759
Authority and they may have authority as

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,079
well but people need to choose to follow

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,299
them

38
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:04,140
people you need people to want

39
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,360
to do the things that the scrum Master

40
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,700
is suggesting because they're helping

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,899
because people see value in the things

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,120
that they're doing

43
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,060
and that takes real skill

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,700
right it's not you as a scrum Master you

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,459
need to and you need to understand the

46
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,080
processes practices and tools right what

47
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,300
is it that the teams that you're working

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,340
with are actually doing right what's

49
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,620
their their context of their technical

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,760
environment what's the context of the

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,260
business environment because you're

52
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,200
going to be helping the product owner

53
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,900
and what's the context of the

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,860
organization as a whole and figure out

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,400
how do I Inc what can I do to increase

56
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,540
the effectiveness of the teams going

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,440
forward

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,580
so while they don't necessarily have any

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,180
real power or authority

60
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:01,800
they can gain That Power Authority

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,780
through people looking to them uh um for

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,920
not for answers that's the wrong way to

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,099
think about it

64
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,980
for for for guidance for they're

65
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,560
providing value to people if you provide

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,120
value to me I'm going to listen to the

67
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,340
things that you have to say because I've

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,099
listened to you in the past you provided

69
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,000
me with value I got a success out of it

70
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:26,040
therefore if if I'm unsure or I need

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,980
more information I'm going to perhaps

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,500
come to you because I respect you I

73
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,300
respect your opinion I respect the

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,519
information that you have

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,280
um I respect the value you provide me

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,140
and that's how a scrum Master makes

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,180
changes in an organization
