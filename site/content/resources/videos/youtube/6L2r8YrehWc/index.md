title: Why the Scrum Master’s True Power Lies in Influence, Not Authority
short_title: Scrum Master Influence vs Authority
description: Explains why a Scrum Master leads through influence, not authority, focusing on building trust, fostering team effectiveness, and supporting agile collaboration.
tldr: The Scrum Master’s effectiveness comes from their ability to influence and build trust within the team, not from formal authority. By consistently providing value and fostering a collaborative environment, they help teams thrive and drive continuous improvement. Development managers should focus on supporting Scrum Masters in developing their leadership and relationship-building skills rather than granting them traditional authority.

In the world of [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}), a common question arises: why isn’t the [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) endowed with any real power or authority as outlined in the Scrum Guide? This is a thought-provoking inquiry, and I’d like to share my perspective based on my experiences in the field.

### Understanding Accountability in Scrum

First and foremost, it’s essential to clarify that the Scrum Master does hold a significant role within the Scrum framework. They are accountable for the effectiveness of the [Scrum team]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-team" >}}). However, this accountability does not translate into explicit authority. Instead, it’s about creating an environment where the team can thrive. 

- **[Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}})**: Their primary responsibility is to maximise the value of the work done.
- **Developers**: They focus on maximising the quality of the product they are developing.
- **Scrum Master**: They are tasked with fostering an effective team environment without the traditional authority that one might expect in a hierarchical structure.

### The Nature of Authority in Organisations

In many organisations, authority is often used as a tool for escalation. When something goes awry, it’s escalated up the chain, and a decision is made—regardless of whether it’s the right one. This is a common scenario, but it’s not how effective teams operate.

A Scrum Master is a leader, and [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) is fundamentally different from authority. Here’s why:

- **Influence Over Authority**: Leaders inspire and motivate others to follow them. The Scrum Master must cultivate an environment where team members choose to follow their guidance because they see the value in it.
- **Skill Development**: It takes real skill to lead without authority. A Scrum Master must understand the processes, practices, and tools relevant to the teams they work with. This includes grasping the technical and business contexts in which the team operates.

### Building Trust and Respect

The power of a Scrum Master lies in their ability to provide value. When team members recognise the value a Scrum Master brings, they are more likely to seek their guidance. This is how a Scrum Master can effect change within an organisation:

- **Providing Value**: If you consistently deliver value, team members will respect your opinion and seek your advice when they need it.
- **Building Relationships**: Establishing trust is crucial. When people respect you and the insights you offer, they are more inclined to follow your lead.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the Scrum Master may not wield traditional power or authority, they possess a different kind of influence that is rooted in accountability and the ability to foster an effective team environment. This approach aligns with the agile mindset, which values collaboration, respect, and [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}).

If you found this discussion insightful, I encourage you to engage with me further. Whether you have questions about Scrum, Agile practices, or [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), I’m always open to a chat.
