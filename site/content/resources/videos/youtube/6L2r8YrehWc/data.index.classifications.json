    "reasoning": "The content centers strictly on the role, influence, and leadership power of the Scrum Master within Scrum teams. Nowhere in the content is Service Level Expectation (SLE) directly mentioned, nor is there an indirect allusion to forecasting delivery, measuring cycle time ranges, or making SLEs transparent—none of the key topics or core concepts are present. The closest thematic overlap is a brief mention of 'continuous improvement', but this pertains to the Scrum Master's style rather than any delivery predictability or metric. The audience is Scrum practitioners, but the topic is wholly unrelated to SLE. There is no off-topic criticism or outdated information, so no penalty was applied. Scores reflect minimal conceptual overlap and extremely low direct category fit.",
