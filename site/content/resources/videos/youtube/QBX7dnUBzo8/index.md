Organizations often struggle to address the root causes of inefficiencies, particularly when adopting Agile practices. Instead of tackling the core issues within their systems, they focus on surface-level problems. This blog post will explore these systemic issues and provide insights on how to make meaningful changes that lead to greater effectiveness and agility.

## **Facing the Real Problems**

Many organizations are too **afraid** to address the underlying problem—the way their system works. Instead, they focus on the **little bits and pieces** around the edges. It’s common to see companies pushing responsibility down the hierarchy for some things but not for others. They implement rituals like daily stand-ups, thinking it will fix everything.

### **Daily Rituals vs. Real Change**

Organizations often fall into the trap of believing that following Agile rituals will magically lead to transformation. They think that if they just **run daily stand-ups**, **plan sprints**, and **follow ceremonies**, everything will change. But in reality, these are just mechanisms—not the outcome you’re trying to achieve.

You’re measuring the wrong things if you believe that simply having these rituals will lead to success. 🛑 It’s essential to **shift your focus** to the **right metrics**—those that genuinely reflect your organization’s progress.

## **What Should You Be Measuring?**

To create meaningful change, organizations should focus on key metrics that drive effectiveness. Here are some important metrics to consider:

- **Return on Investment (ROI)** 💰

- **Profit per team member**

- **Cost to deliver**

- **Meantime to repair (MTTR)**

- **Time to learn** 📚

- **Closing feedback loops** 🔁

- **Identifying market opportunities**

These are the critical measurements that can guide your organization toward true improvement.

### **Understanding Market Opportunities**

One key area that organizations fail to address is **what they don’t know**—the opportunities they’re missing. What does your product not do that it could do? What new markets could you tap into? And how do you find this information? These are the **tough questions** that many organizations shy away from because they’re hard to answer.

In fact, 70% of startups **fail** within the first few years. Even more ideas fail to convince anyone to back them financially. Understanding your market and being prepared to **pivot** when needed is crucial to surviving and thriving.

## **Courage to Change: A Lesson from Consulting**

As an Agile coach, one of my biggest regrets stems from a **consulting engagement** nearly ten years ago. I was working with a CEO who had just led a major **reorganization** of the company into silos. The CEO asked me a critical question:

“Should we throw out the changes we’ve made and reorganize differently?”

I gave what I thought was a reasonable answer at the time: “No, you can change slowly and iteratively toward the outcome you want.”

In hindsight, that was the wrong answer.

## **The Band-Aid Approach: Rip It Off!**

The right answer should have been, **"Yes, rip off that Band-Aid!"** 🩹 Reorganizing into even more silos was a **step in the wrong direction**, and the CEO should have been encouraged to take faster and more decisive action. Reorganizations are **expensive**, and incremental changes often lead to **ongoing pain** and **hemorrhaging of money**.

Sometimes, the best approach is to make the big, bold moves upfront, even though they’re uncomfortable. It’s about having the **courage** to admit that the current system isn’t working and making the necessary changes to ensure long-term success.

## **Overcoming Agile Atrophy**

One of the most common challenges I see in organizations is **Agile atrophy**. Teams become disengaged with Agile practices because the system around them hasn’t changed. They start saying things like, “I can’t be bothered with Agile anymore.”

This happens because **Agile** isn’t just a set of ceremonies or rituals. It requires **fundamental changes** in the way you do business at every level of the organization. If you don’t address the deeper structural issues, **Agile won’t work**.

### **Agile Isn’t a Magic Fix**

Agile doesn’t magically make your organization better. It’s about **systematic and continuous improvement**—taking small steps in some cases, but also being willing to make **big jumps** when necessary.

The question is, do you have the **courage** to make those changes? 🚀

## **The Role of Agile Coaches: A Personal Reflection**

As an Agile coach, I’ve learned that my role isn’t just about helping teams adopt Agile rituals. It’s about helping organizations face the **tough decisions** and embrace the **changes** they need to make.

I’ve seen too many organizations hire Agile coaches without truly committing to the **transformational changes** that are required. Agile coaches can guide teams and leaders, but ultimately, the organization must be willing to **change its system**.

### **Consulting Challenges and Lessons Learned**

Reflecting on my past consulting experience, I’ve learned the importance of **speaking up** and recommending the right course of action, even when it’s difficult. The CEO I worked with years ago could have benefited from more direct advice—**ripping off the Band-Aid** instead of slowly trying to change.

These are the types of lessons that shape us as coaches and consultants. It’s not always easy to tell leaders they need to change, but it’s essential if we want to create **lasting improvements**.

## **Systematic and Continuous Improvement**

At the heart of Agile is the concept of **systematic and continuous improvement**. Whether you’re making small, incremental changes or taking big leaps, the goal is always to improve your organization’s **effectiveness**.

🔄 **Continuous improvement** isn’t just about tweaking your Agile ceremonies. It’s about improving your entire **business system** so that Agile can truly thrive.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Agile isn’t a magic fix—it requires **fundamental changes** at every level of the organization.

- Don’t focus solely on rituals and ceremonies; instead, measure **ROI**, **profit per team member**, and other meaningful metrics.

- Be willing to make the **big, bold changes** necessary for long-term success.

- **Agile coaches** can guide you, but real change starts with **organizational courage**.
