1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,839
organizations and people are too scared

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:10,400
to address the real problem which is the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:13,040
way the system works right so they're

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,000
they focus on the little bits and pieces

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,880
around the edge oh let's push

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,880
responsibility down the organization for

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,480
some things but not other things let's

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,160
uh what else do they do let's let's

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,519
let's have people run these ceremonies

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,199
right uh we're going to we're going to

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,160
do a daily we're going to have a daily

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,559
that'll fix everything right but these

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,160
are the the

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,399
mechanisms not the thing that you're

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,239
trying to achieve you're you're

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,920
measuring the wrong thing if you think

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,280
that having those things is going to

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,879
result in a different way of doing

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,960
things you should be measuring return on

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,600
investment you should be measuring uh um

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,120
uh uh a profit profit per per per team

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,719
member right uh you should be looking at

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,280
your your your your feedback Lopes and

24
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,479
your cost to deliver and your meantime

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,840
to repair and things your time to learn

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,799
right closing those feedback loops you

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,400
should be measuring um what you don't

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,080
know right what what does your product

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,759
not do that it could do that is a market

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,159
opportunity and where do you go looking

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,119
for that information how do you as a

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,360
business find that this stuff is hard

33
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,960
and 70% of all startups right 70% of all

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,759
ideas that people have are going to fail

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,079
easy 70% of ideas are going to fail in

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,360
fact 70% of startups I bet it's a much

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:45,280
higher percentage of ideas because not L

38
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,280
all ideas manage to convince somebody to

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,200
give them the money to start the idea in

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,880
the first place right ideas are the most

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,920
nebulous one and if you're building

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,840
products and you're trying to capture

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Market you have to be focused on what

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
helps us as a business be as effective

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:10,039
as we can be within the context of those

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,039
markets and that that doesn't come uh um

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:18,920
from Not Having the

48
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,680
courage to admit that you need to change

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,000
more things so the the common one that I

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,959
see in organizations is that an agile

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,160
coach uh uh comes in I've been I've been

52
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,560
this this I wasn't an agile coach at the

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,000
time uh but my my biggest regret this is

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,360
my biggest regret in in Consulting it's

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,519
from years ago I was still wet behind

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,800
the ears I wasn't uh a very

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,599
sophisticated uh consultant at the time

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,280
um this was probably nearly 10 years

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,879
ago and a CEO pulled me aside and

60
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,159
basically said look we've just gone

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,599
through a major

62
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,640
reorganization um and they'd reorganized

63
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,080
into silos by the way just different

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,080
sort of silos and he

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,080
said

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,360
um all the things that you're talking

67
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
about I was talking about devops seem to

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
be

69
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,840
different from the way we've organized

70
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,080
ourselves do we need to throw all of

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,760
that out because it was very expensive

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
right to do that reorg reorgs are

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,519
expensive or else don't do reor it's

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,080
expensive um and do we need to change

75
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,680
the way we do things

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,360
completely and I

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,760
said

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,720
no you can change slowly and iteratively

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,319
towards the thing you want to

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,360
achieve and that was a bad

81
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,079
answer the right answer would have been

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,360
yeah rip that Band-Aid

83
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,079
off disinfect the wound that you just

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,840
created by changing your organization to

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,959
even more silos right in the wrong

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,720
direction and

87
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,359
move faster and with less constant pain

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,160
and suffering and hemorrhaging of money

89
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,120
to a resolution to a different system

90
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,919
that enabled you to be more successful

91
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,240
and that is the difficulty the difficult

92
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,600
call that lots of organizations have is

93
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,080
that the

94
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,919
fundamentally the reason you can't take

95
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,280
advantage of agile the reason agile is

96
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,360
so difficult the reason you've got agile

97
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,039
atrophy in your organization that people

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,039
are just like I can't be B what that

99
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,919
don't don't mention agile to me anymore

100
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,199
that kind of attitude is because you've

101
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,720
not addressed the changes that need to

102
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,600
happen in the way you do

103
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,680
business in order for agile to be

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,120
successful it isn't just magically

105
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,240
successful you need to fundamentally

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,560
change the way you do business at every

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,639
level in your

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,120
organization in order to move towards

109
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,120
what people are calling agility right

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,560
this agile movement big a agile or

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,000
little a agile but really it's about

112
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,039
your organization systematically and

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
continuously improving its Effectiveness

114
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,520
in sometimes small jumps but sometimes

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,360
you need big jumps to improve that

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,800
Effectiveness and do you have the

117
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,560
courage to make that change if you want

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,960

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,560
