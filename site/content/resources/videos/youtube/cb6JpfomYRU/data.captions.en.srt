1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,860
the first thing they're going to get is

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,960
the ability to start putting into

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,940
practice immediately so you come on

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,460
session one and you're going to get

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,560
homework basically things you need to do

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,720
it's not stuff that it's not like school

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,420
homework where you're given exercises to

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,800
do it's all of the exercises are aimed

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,320
at doing things in your real

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,539
organization and finding out where the

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,220
issues are finding out where that is so

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,440
you can bring it back to the group bring

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,059
it back to the class so we can get

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,440
together on that but you don't have to

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,120
wait till the end of the class to start

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
doing it you can do it right from week

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,140
one you're going to get some real value

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,600
you're going to find some real things

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,579
about your organization

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
we always say scrum doesn't solve your

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,719
problems it shows you where your

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,360
problems are to help you solve them so

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,640
we're doing that right at the start but

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,460
it doesn't mean in a traditional class

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,860
you learn this with with us for two days

26
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,780
and therefore you go and find your

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,460
problems afterwards so some of us some

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,500
trainers will say hey get in touch with

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,420
with your problems but

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,460
people tend not to is what I've noticed

31
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,020
it'd be great if they did actually but

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,600
in this they're bringing their problems

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,880
back so they're not on their own so

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,799
effectively we're going with a hive mind

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,900
solution to help them solve their

36
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,740
problems rather than make them feel on

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,960
their own

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,100
that's absolutely huge because it means

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,619
they're getting into a more of a

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,780
community of practice way of thinking so

41
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,759
many organizations already have scrum

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,860
Master community of practice or product

43
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,720
growing a community of practice but if

44
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,820
they don't they need somebody to set

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,000
them up somebody like a scrum Master for

46
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,520
example so they can go and do that and

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,140
that goes on throughout so every every

48
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,780
week you've got the opportunity to try

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,299
something new come back and learn and

50
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,460
learn in a safer environment so you're

51
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,860
bringing in these unsafe nasty work

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,899
environment where you know it's

53
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,040
yeah like I said if we're all in a

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,420
perfect world you'd probably not be

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
coming on to the scrum class in the

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,939
first place because you'd already know

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,219
it all and the organization would

58
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,719
already be doing it so it would bring in

59
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,819
that dirty stuff back into the clean

60
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,340
world of the classroom where we can be

61
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,860
safe try things come up with ideas talk

62
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,440
it through come up with Concepts and

63
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,440
then apply it back so it's a real mix of

64
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,840
coaching and training so it's not just a

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,260
classroom experience there's this

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,540
opportunity that to mix those two things

67
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,360
it would also give you this opportunity

68
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,580
of a brain's trust imagine if you are

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,739
the very first scrum master in your

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,959
organization to ever come and learn

71
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,060
scrum and there isn't a community of

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,680
practice here I've got a cohort of

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,599
people I'm going along with on my

74
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,040
journey that I'm doing difficult things

75
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,260
with actually and sharing that

76
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,319
experience and with shared experiences

77
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,599
and shared hardships we build bonds and

78
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,700
those bonds I imagine will go well

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,680
beyond these the situation certainly

80
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,239
when I've ever worked in a cohort I

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,700
always find out I'm still in touch with

82
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,280
those people years later

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,680
you also have this weird thing of not

84
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,739
having to take two days out of the the

85
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,959
office to come to a class now we are

86
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,519
asking for an actual larger commitment

87
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,760
in terms of more out of the office time

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,800
but it's much more manageable it's one

89
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,780
afternoon a week it's not two big days

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,819
and a big chunk when all sorts of things

91
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,620
could happen back at the office that

92
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,420
then become distractions while you're

93
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,980
trying to learn and you have to go and

94
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,019
deal with things during the class time

95
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,120
so you miss things

96
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,420
half a day a week is much more

97
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,920
manageable and it allows you to get into

98
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,319
that thing without having to have this

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,060
big headache how do I have to sort all

100
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,280
of these weird things out

101
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,959
and I had to say it but things just like

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,659
going to pick the kids up from school

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,239
become a big drag situation and an

104
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,280
online class when it's a couple of days

105
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,280
you don't necessarily have that because

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,159
we can work around it

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,959
I think the biggest Advantage for the

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,120
people coming on the class

109
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,099
while this the certification is the same

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,319
it leads to the psm1 certification

111
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,720
however you choose the PSM modern class

112
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,239
and the two-day experience is an awesome

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,099
class we've refined it we've done it

114
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,700
well and

115
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,260
this gives you that little bit of extra

116
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,400
that it's really hard to do in a two-day

117
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,220
class space to learn

118
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,020
space to learn is essential and it

119
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,000
there's a lot of content there's a lot

120
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,560
of cognitive burden on coming onto a

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,780
two-day class

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,280
by the nature of it this allows you to

123
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,800
take it in a chunk

124
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,259
try it for real take it to that deeper

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,960
learning level by applying the learning

126
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,000
immediately bring it back Loop through

127
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,520
it again effectively in that space as

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,259
well so we end up with multiple Loops of

129
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,580
learning we'll end up with real

130
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:52,560
application so as a PSM

131
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,540
that's been through this program as a

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,060
sorry as a scrum master has been through

133
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,919
this program you get this deeper

134
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,400
learning this deeper understanding that

135
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,960
makes you more confident and what I see

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,880
with a lot of new scrum Masters when

137
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,199
they come on the class and at the

138
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,540
beginning of their Journey

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,300
they typically have the hardest problems

140
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,680
to solve in their career right at the

141
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,300
start when they've got the least

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,160
experience and the least knowledge to be

143
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,199
able to deal with it that's the nature

144
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,699
of it as you get better the team's also

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
got better therefore you don't need it

146
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,600
the organizations also evolved therefore

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,759
they don't need quite so much of you

148
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,320
this gives you that confidence that you

149
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,720
have been able to do this in the real

150
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,060
world and you have had that support net

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,039
so when the support net scales back when

152
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,259
you finish the class you've got more

153
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,919
confidence in your own ability and of

154
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,259
course

155
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,060
will that get you a better job who knows

156
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,460
but certainly your confidence will shine

157
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,900
shine through when you're talking to

158
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,900
those people about that job
