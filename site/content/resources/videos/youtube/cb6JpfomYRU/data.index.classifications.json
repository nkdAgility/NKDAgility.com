    "reasoning": "The content is focused on practical training and community support for Scrum Masters, emphasizing real-world application, confidence-building, and peer collaboration in Agile environments. There is no mention of agentic principles, autonomous AI agents, contextual intelligence, or the integration of proactive AI or modern engineering practices as outlined in the Agentic Software Delivery category. The discussion exclusively relates to human-centered learning, coaching, and Scrum-specific practices with no reference to intelligent agents, agency, or systematic agent-based process augmentation. The intended audience—Agile practitioners/Scrum Masters—is not misaligned but the topic is not agentic. All dimensions score low due to minimal or no overlap with the classification definition.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is about human learning and community support for Scrum Masters; it does not address agentic software delivery, AI agents, or related concepts. The fit with the assigned category is minimal and only tangential at best.",
    "level": "Ignored"
