    "reasoning": "The content focuses on strategies and considerations for ensuring data integrity during DevOps migrations, comparing methods and offering practical recommendations. There is minimal mention of foundational beliefs or system-level convictions that underpin sustainable delivery. Main emphasis is given to process choices, technical trade-offs, and operational guidance rather than exploring the deeper, demonstrable values or the ethos driving DevOps practices. The presenter does not explicitly or implicitly address ethos as the core beneath principles or as foundational to authentic transformation; instead, the discussion centers on making pragmatic decisions, managing risk, and coordinating team readiness. While the advice aligns with good DevOps practices and aims at team success, it does not meet the category's threshold for depth or explicit exploration of ethos.",

    "reasoning": "The content is centered on data integrity practices during DevOps migrations, with focus on technical decisions (full vs. selective migration), risk management, and team readiness. While there is a nod to assessing what is 'critical for your teams,' it does not explicitly define customer value or make user outcomes central. The closest alignment to Customer Focus is advising assessment of team needs and enabling effective workflows, but these are inward-focused, without mention of customer feedback, measurable customer outcomes, or explicit customer value. The discussion is informative and practical, primarily helping technical practitioners manage migrations, not directly prioritizing customer experience or value. No penalties needed; the low score reflects minimal inclusion of Customer Focus principles.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article thoroughly covers data integrity in DevOps migrations, emphasizing technical practices and team needs, but does not meaningfully address customer outcomes or value. The focus is internal, so Customer Focus alignment is minimal.",

While the audience (DevOps practitioners) and subject (DevOps integrity) partially align, there is no discussion of foundational, immutable constraints or non-negotiable truths as required for this category. The discussion is contextual, advisory, and centered on best practices rather than irreducible principles. Confidence score reflects strong deviation from scope.",
