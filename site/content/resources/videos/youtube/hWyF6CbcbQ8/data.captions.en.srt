1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
here's what you need to know about data

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,679
integrity and is your devops

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,800
migrations um you can't have everything

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,519
depending on what it is you want to do

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,279
so there's a balance to be had between

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,560
Fidelity of the data that you're

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,600
migrating and the flexibility that you

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:27,679
want as part of your migration process

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,519
um so as your devops on Prem was TFS um

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,600
has a a database based architecture

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,160
right so you have a whole database of

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,600
data if you're taking that whole

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,000
Database The Collection um in in TFS and

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,280
Azure devops if you're taking that up to

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,399
Azure devops services in the cloud um as

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,280
one thing the whole thing we're taking

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,840
it together then we have the highest

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,039
Fidelity possible right we're we're

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,199
effectively taking the entire database

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,160
up with everything in it's in exactly

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:02,640
the same format that it is just now um

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
but for many organizations that's not

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,240
what they want to do they have a couple

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,240
of teams that want to go or they have

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,960
some teams that are able to go and other

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,600
teams that aren't um so part of that

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,640
migration uh uh process we've built a

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,520
bunch of tools that allow you to

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,000
selectively slice out the data that you

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:31,399
want to take uh but it does mean like

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,799
lower Fidelity because we're effectively

32
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:38,759
replaying the story of the data um

33
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,560
against the new environment right so

34
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,960
we're not importing the database we're

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,320
um replaying what happened with the data

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,880
and that means that there is a little

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,759
bit of data loss things don't always go

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,119
perfectly um but within that context of

39
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,960
taking uh the the the your choice of

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,200
data pick and mix uh from one place to

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,320
another it is the most flexible um

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,320
approach you can have
