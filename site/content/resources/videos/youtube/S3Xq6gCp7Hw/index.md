# How much of an impact can a strong, skilled product owner have?

We all know the legend of Steve Jobs. A phenomenal visionary that helped #apple create some of the most iconic devices, designs, and functionality that the world has ever seen.

A man that is credited with single-handedly resurrecting #apple and creating the kinds of products and features that blew customers away, even if apple customers never imagined that they would want or need such a thing.

Now, there are some people who adore Steve Jobs and others who despise him. This isn't a conversation about Steve Jobs, it is instead an exploration of just how valuable a single person, in this case a #productowner, working in collaboration with a high-performance #scrumteam, can be.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood explains why a great #productowner is such a valuable person, to both the team and the organization, and how they create value for customers and consumers.
