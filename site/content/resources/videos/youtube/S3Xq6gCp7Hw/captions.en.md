okay

so the question is how much of an impact can a strong skilled product owner have

I oh ball game right I mean it's it's if you let Engineers be engineers they will do the engineering right we we can we can it's it's fairly it's fairly straightforward I know that's a generalism but it's fairly straightforward to get a group of people to build lots of stuff right to special engineering teams Sops coders software teams testers they want to get through the work they want to build lots of stuff and you you can you can move teams more easily towards creating lots of stuff so now we've got lots of stuff coming out the other end but it's not the right stuff it's not the valuable stuff it's just stuff it's just what customers have been asking for it's just what which isn't necessarily the right thing

so we can get quite quickly to building lots of stuff but it's very very difficult to build the right stuff and the difference between uh an average product owner right which not a bad product owner is just bad right there's no point in having them an average product owner is going to be focused on how do I be that funnel for for the organization the customer stuff coming in to get a single story right that's an average product owner but when you have a real product owner like a great product owner they're they're they're they're not looking at that they're looking forward into the they've delegated that to their team already right the team's doing that they're looking forward into the future they're thinking about how do I get things in front of the customer when they need them not too late because ultimately when your customer asks you for features when they ask you for capabilities in your product it's already too late because it takes time for you to deliver those features and then by the time you've delivered them that's the delay the cost of delay between the ask or acos of player between what the customer is asking for and when you're actually delivering it I mean it might be two weeks but it might be a big thing and it's three months it might be six months what what does what does not having those features cost the business from when they realize they need them

so great product owners are looking forward into the future they're looking at the markets if it's a b2c product if it's a B2B product they're looking at the state of the organization they're looking at what's what's happening in the business what direction is strategic direction is the business going and building lots of little experimental features to figure out what resonates best with the users in order to solve those future problems and test those ideas so that when customers do ask for features your answer is would you like us to turn that on for you we've got our uh uh uh you know uh we've got a version of that ready to go for you would you like to try it or even it's already there right I mean that's that's the that's the trick that's um I can't remember the name of the author but there's a book called crossing the chasm um and that's what it focuses on is how do we stop building for the laguards right the people that that they aren't the innovators they're just the people there's table Stakes right products must do those things how do we how do we cross over and start building for the early adopters how do we how do we get early adopters into our story how do we engage with those people how do we find them so that we can start building features for the early adopters because what the early adopters want today is what the laguards want in six months time

right so then then those people that are the early adopters who are early adopters because they want to engage and they want to play with new experimental things you're engaging with them and they're telling all their friends who are the laggards right all the cool stuff that's coming down the line and they're like oh that's cool but we don't need it yet right we don't need that yet because we're not using it but even just that planting that seed of that idea starts to lead to the market rather than follow the market right so I and my market I mean either external or internal market so the the the difference between the thing that makes that product owner great is that that they're able to anticipate what the next thing is using evidence-based techniques using empiricism

Levering hypothesis driven engineering practices to be able to get it one step ahead of where everything else is the ultimate the ultimate Accolade for a great product owner is that that company's competitors are looking at what they're doing and saying what are they doing let's build that right that means you're leading the market rather than following the market and that's kind of where you want to be
