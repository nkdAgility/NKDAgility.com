1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,800
okay

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,800
[Music]

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:18,960
so the question is how much of an impact

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,060
can a strong skilled product owner have

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,820
I

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,660
oh ball game right I mean

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,660
it's it's

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,460
if you let

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,059
Engineers be engineers

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,180
they will do the engineering right we we

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,700
can we can it's it's fairly it's fairly

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,200
fairly straightforward I know that's a

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
generalism but it's fairly

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,239
straightforward to get a group of people

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,059
to build lots of stuff

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,820
right to to special engineering teams

17
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,379
Sops coders software teams testers they

18
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,300
want to get through the work they want

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,980
to build lots of stuff and you you can

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,660
you can move teams more easily towards

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,159
creating lots of stuff so now we've got

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,040
lots of stuff coming out the other end

23
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,320
but it's not the right stuff

24
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,119
it's not the valuable stuff it's just

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,979
stuff it's just what customers have been

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,900
asking for it's just what which isn't

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,780
necessarily the right thing

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,759
so we can get quite quickly to building

29
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,159
lots of stuff but it's very very

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,220
difficult to build the right stuff

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,640
and the difference between uh an average

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,439
product owner right which not a bad

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,299
product owner is just bad right there's

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,780
no point in having them an average

35
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,180
product owner is going to be focused on

36
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:42,439
how do I be that funnel

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,200
for for the organization the customer

38
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,500
stuff coming in to get a single story

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
right that's an average product owner

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,000
but when you have a real product owner

41
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,979
like a great product owner they're

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,720
they're they're they're not looking at

43
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,280
that they're looking forward into the

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,399
they've delegated that to their team

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,119
already right the team's doing that

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,520
they're looking forward into the future

47
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,440
they're thinking about

48
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,680
how do I

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,640
get things in front of the customer

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,080
when they need them not too late

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,480
because ultimately when your customer

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,000
asks you for features when they ask you

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,760
for capabilities in your product it's

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,319
already too late because it takes time

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,700
for you to deliver those features and

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,280
then by the time you've delivered them

57
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,980
that's the delay the cost of delay

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,599
between the ask or acos of player

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,760
between what the customer is asking for

60
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,440
and when you're actually delivering it I

61
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,120
mean it might be two weeks but it might

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,640
be a big thing and it's three months it

63
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,739
might be six months what what does what

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,060
does not having those features cost the

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,080
business from when they realize they

66
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,720
need them

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,239
so great product owners are looking

68
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,739
forward into the future they're looking

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,660
at the markets if it's a b2c product if

70
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,480
it's a B2B product they're looking at

71
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,360
the state of the organization they're

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,060
looking at what's what's happening in

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,980
the business what direction is strategic

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,860
direction is the business going

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,180
and building lots of little experimental

76
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,120
features

77
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,760
to figure out what resonates best with

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,700
the users in order to solve those future

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,459
problems and test those ideas

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,620
so that when customers do ask for

81
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,200
features

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,319
your answer is would you like us to turn

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,420
that on for you we've got our uh uh uh

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,340
you know uh we've got a version of that

85
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,019
ready to go for you would you like to

86
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,080
try it

87
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,640
or even it's already there right I mean

88
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,500
that's that's the that's the trick

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,760
that's um I can't remember the name of

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,980
the author but there's a book called

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,959
crossing the chasm

92
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,920
um and that's what it focuses on is how

93
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,400
do we

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,620
stop building for the laguards right the

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
people that that

96
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,700
um

97
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,560
they aren't the innovators they're just

98
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,140
the people there's table Stakes right

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,000
products must do those things how do we

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,060
how do we cross over and start building

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,400
for the early adopters how do we how do

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,079
we get early adopters into our story how

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,299
do we engage with those people how do we

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
find them so that we can start building

105
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,079
features for the early adopters because

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,580
what the early adopters want today is

107
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,840
what the laguards want in six months

108
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,500
time

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,600
right so then then those people that are

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,360
the early adopters who are early

111
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,400
adopters because they want to engage and

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
they want to play with new experimental

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,060
things

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,800
you're engaging with them and they're

115
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,560
telling all their friends who are the

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,060
laggards right all the cool stuff that's

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,680
coming down the line and they're like oh

118
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,600
that's cool but we don't need it yet

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,060
right we don't need that yet because

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,580
we're not using it but even just that

121
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,460
planting that seed of that idea

122
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,160
starts to lead to the market rather than

123
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,720
follow the market right so I and my

124
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,199
market I mean either external or

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,639
internal market so the the the

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,979
difference between

127
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,660
the thing that makes that product owner

128
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:15,360
great is that that they're able to

129
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:17,100
anticipate what the next thing is using

130
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,919
evidence-based techniques using

131
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,360
empiricism

132
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,120
Levering hypothesis driven engineering

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,680
practices to be able to get it one step

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,960
ahead of where everything else is the

135
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,479
the ultimate the ultimate Accolade for a

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,160
great product owner is that that

137
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,680
company's competitors are looking at

138
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,259
what they're doing and saying what are

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,820
they doing let's build that right that

140
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,740
means you're leading the market rather

141
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,699
than following the market and that's

142
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,699
kind of where you want to be
