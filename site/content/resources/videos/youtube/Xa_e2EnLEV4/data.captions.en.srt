1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,040
one of the most common behaviors that

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:09,240
will greatly impact on your ability to

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,080
be successful um at any process but

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,040
specifically having a a cad strategy is

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:21,119
is sweeping your problems under the rug

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,599
um so that's a most teams will not

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,679
necessarily

8
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,960
nefariously but hide or ignore their

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,160
problems that's why when we we talk

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
about retrospectives we talk about uh H

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,559
um reflection we talk about kaizan as a

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,960
phrase are we hiding or ignoring

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,879
anything right that's something to to to

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,440
actively look at and it's

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:51,120
because we we as humans are really

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,079
really good at ignoring stuff that maybe

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,359
we feel like it's too much effort maybe

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:02,399
we feel like we can't do anything about

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:05,840
I I I remember um a Time uh living in a

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:12,240
flat with my brother in the West End of

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:16,080
Glasgow and um we never cleaned the

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,600
grill because nobody wanted to do it we

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,079
effectively swept that work under the

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,720
rug and went N I don't I don't really

25
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,680
know how to do that right I mean that's

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
that's I've got to got to go figure out

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,479
this was before YouTubes right I got to

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,159
go figure out how to clean this perhaps

29
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,000
I have to phone my mom and ask her right

30
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,119
how do I how do I do this um what's the

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,159
best way to approach it what level

32
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,759
of detail do I need in how to do that so

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,840
both of us ignored it completely and we

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,079
used it all the time so what do you

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,640
think happened

36
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,920
eventually what do you think happened

37
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,560
eventually yeah you're right it caught

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,840
fire it caught fire

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,920
and we had a fire in the kitchen we

40
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,320
didn't have a fire extinguisher cuz we

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,160
also swept that under the rug and didn't

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,480
do that and at one point my brother had

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,040
grabbed a pan full of water and was

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,800
about to throw it into the grill and

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,280
then he realized no like it's not a good

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,160
idea to throw water on a fat fire right

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,280
CU if you've ever seen those

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,879
those adverts on TV it just explodes you

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,360
don't want to throw water on a fat fire

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,519
uh so we stopped called the fire brigade

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,879
fire brigade arrived they came up with a

52
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:43,720
fire extinguisher and Went Done Right

53
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,239
but we needed to clean the

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,640
grill that was our trigger to go do that

55
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,280
and then to continue to do it regular I

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
actually don't remember we were we were

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,159
teenagers I don't remember if we

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,239
actually continue to do it regularly or

59
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,959
we just did it once and then maybe then

60
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,319
wherever that cooker ended up up

61
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,840
somebody else will need to do it but

62
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:11,000
you've got to do the things otherwise

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,200
this cruft builds up right and that

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,680
cruft could be dirt it could be fat it

65
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,120
could be clogging up the system it can

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,760
be just getting in the way making things

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,959
a little bit more difficult it could

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,720
take the guise of bureaucratic processes

69
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,280
in your organization it could take the

70
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,360
guise of technical debt in your product

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,400
it could just be purely architected

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,920
purly designed stuff that you've created

73
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,920
and nobody goes back uh uh to to to to

74
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,280
resolve those things just sweeping

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,640
problems under the rug and ignore them

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
for you know that in every cartoon they

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,519
have that moment where they're cleaning

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
up a kid's room and they just open the

79
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,879
cupboard shove everything in and then

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,360
close the cupboard really quickly and

81
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,239
then at some point the cupboard door

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,239
pops open and all the stuff falls out

83
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,560
again that's what we're trying to avoid

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,439
that's why why we need discipline to not

85
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,760
sweep things under the rug to do

86
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,959
something about it we need courage when

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,560
things might be a little bit more

88
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,680
difficult to deal with a cban strategy

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,160
is not going to be effective if you or

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,800
your team sweep things into the under

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,479
the rug have the discipline and courage

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,360
to implement a caman strategy fully if

93
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,880
you're struggling to implement a cand

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,160
strategy we can help or help you find
