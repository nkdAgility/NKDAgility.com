### The Danger of Ignoring Problems in Your [Kanban]({{< ref "/categories/kanban" >}}) Strategy

**Introduction**

One of the most common behaviors that can severely impact the success of any process, particularly a Kanban strategy, is sweeping problems under the rug. Ignoring issues, whether intentionally or not, can lead to significant setbacks and even disasters.



* * *

**The Habit of Ignoring Problems**

Ignoring problems is a habit many teams fall into. Here’s why this happens and how to avoid it:

1. **Natural Tendency to Avoid**:

- Humans often avoid tasks that seem too difficult or time-consuming. This leads to issues being ignored rather than addressed.

- This avoidance can be due to a lack of knowledge, fear of the effort required, or simply not knowing how to tackle the problem.

1. **Common Scenario**:

- Consider a scenario where household chores are neglected, such as never cleaning the grill because it’s seen as too much effort. Over time, this leads to a build-up of grease and eventually, a fire hazard.

- This scenario is analogous to teams ignoring [technical debt]({{< ref "/tags/technical-debt" >}}) or bureaucratic processes, leading to larger problems down the line.

* * *

**Consequences of Ignoring Problems**

Ignoring problems doesn’t make them go away; it makes them worse:

1. **Accumulation of Issues**:

- Over time, small ignored problems can accumulate, leading to significant blockages in your system.

- This can manifest as bureaucratic hurdles, technical debt, or inefficiencies in your workflow.

1. **Inevitability of Crisis**:

- Just as a neglected grill eventually catches fire, ignored problems in your workflow will eventually cause a crisis.

- This crisis could be in the form of project delays, cost overruns, or failure to deliver value to customers.

* * *

**The Importance of Addressing Issues**

Addressing issues promptly is critical for maintaining an effective Kanban strategy:

1. **Regular Maintenance**:

- Just as regular cleaning prevents a grill fire, regular maintenance of your workflow prevents issues from escalating.

- This involves revisiting and refining processes, addressing technical debt, and removing bureaucratic hurdles.

1. **Developing Discipline and Courage**:

- Teams need the discipline to regularly address issues rather than ignoring them.

- Courage is required to tackle difficult problems head-on, even when the solutions are not immediately obvious.

* * *

**Practical Steps to Avoid Ignoring Problems**

Implementing a Kanban strategy effectively requires proactive problem-solving:

1. **Identify and Visualize Problems**:

- Use your Kanban board to visualize where problems are occurring in your workflow. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

1. **Conduct Regular Retrospectives**:

- Regularly reflect on what’s working and what’s not. Ask questions like, “Are we hiding or ignoring anything?” to ensure problems are brought to light.

1. **Create a Culture of [Transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}})**:

- Foster an environment where team members feel safe to raise issues without fear of blame.

- Transparency helps in creating awareness and collective problem-solving.

1. **Take Action**:

- Once problems are identified, take immediate action to address them. This might involve process changes, additional training, or bringing in external expertise.

* * *

**Conclusion**

Ignoring problems can derail your Kanban strategy and lead to significant issues. By developing the discipline and courage to address problems head-on, you can maintain an effective workflow and continuously improve your processes.
