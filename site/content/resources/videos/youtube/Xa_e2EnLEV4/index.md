# 3 best ways to wreck your Kanban adoption. Sweeping problems under the rug.

Conquering Challenges in Kanban: The Perils of Ignoring Problems
Acknowledging the Elephant in the Room

Ignoring problems, or "sweeping them under the rug," is a behavior that can significantly undermine the success of any process, but it's particularly detrimental in the context of a Kanban strategy. This common pitfall can prevent teams from achieving their full potential and delivering maximum value.

The Danger of Overlooking Issues

Human Tendency: It's a natural human inclination to overlook problems that seem daunting or unsolvable. This avoidance behavior can stem from a belief that the issue is too complex, or from a lack of confidence in our ability to tackle it.
Retrospectives and Kaizen: Reflection sessions and continuous improvement practices are designed to bring hidden problems to light. Asking, "Are we hiding or ignoring anything?" is a crucial step in identifying and addressing underlying issues.

A Personal Anecdote

The Unattended Grill: A relatable story shared involves neglecting the cleaning of a grill, leading to a fire incident. This narrative serves as a metaphor for what happens when problems are ignored in a work environment—eventually, the issues catch fire, causing significant disruptions.

Implications for Teams and Projects

Buildup of 'Cruft': Unaddressed issues can accumulate over time, manifesting as bureaucratic hurdles, technical debt, or inefficient processes. This buildup makes tasks increasingly difficult and can severely impact productivity and product quality.
Bursting Closets: The analogy of a closet stuffed with ignored items eventually bursting open illustrates the inevitable consequence of ignoring problems. Sooner or later, these issues will resurface, often at the most inopportune times.

The Path Forward

Discipline and Courage: Overcoming the temptation to ignore problems requires discipline to confront issues head-on and the courage to tackle challenges, even when the solutions are not immediately evident.
Collaborative Problem-Solving: A Kanban strategy thrives on team collaboration. Discussing and addressing problems collectively can lead to innovative solutions and stronger team cohesion.
