    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the dangers of ignoring problems within a Kanban strategy and discusses actionable steps to avoid such pitfalls. It directly addresses the importance of identifying and visualizing problems, conducting regular retrospectives, and creating a culture of transparency—these are actionable guiding principles that align with the tenets of Kanban. However, while it discusses non-compliance with Kanban principles in depth, it does not explicitly state or frame these as tenets, reducing its score for direct mentions. Overall, the content is primarily about how to maintain and improve Kanban processes, fitting well within the tenet category, albeit without strong explicit references or a highly prescriptive nature.",
    "level": "Secondary",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content is a good fit for the tenet category because it explores key principles for effective Kanban use, such as problem identification, transparency, and regular reflection. While it doesn’t label these as official tenets, it offers practical advice that aligns with Kanban’s core values, making it relevant for those seeking to understand or reinforce foundational Kanban practices."

While it touches on problem identification and addressing issues, which is important for capabilities, it does not elaborate on cultivating or embedding capabilities into organizational culture or processes. The emphasis is more on avoiding transient mistakes rather than on enhancing sustainable abilities or practices.

    "reasoning": "The content discusses pitfalls in Kanban adoption, specifically the dangers of ignoring problems and emphasizes the importance of transparency, regular maintenance, and proactive problem solving. However, it makes zero direct or indirect reference to Service Level Expectation (SLE). There is no mention of cycle time forecasting, probability-based time ranges, or the use of historical flow metrics as part of SLE calculation, nor are there references to established SLE guidance, Kanban for Scrum Teams, or authoritative sources. While the audience is broadly aligned with people interested in improving Kanban processes, none of the main ideas or actionable guidance pertains directly to SLE as defined—discussions center on culture, transparency, and discipline, not delivery forecast or flow predictability tied to SLE. The content also remains at a general process/behavioral level rather than analytical or metric-driven. Small scores are assigned for audience and some slight conceptual proximity due to themes of transparency and improvement, but all core SLE criteria are absent. Therefore, confidence in fit is very low and proportionate to the surface-level thematic overlap rather than any direct SLE discussion.",
