00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:32,239
hello my name's Martin Intuit and today

2
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm going to be talking a little bit

3
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,800
around the professional scrum

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:46,129
foundations class and the PSM 1

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:47,930
assessment naked agility is available

6
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,790
for DevOps and agile training and

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,360
consulting contact us for a free

8
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,360
consultation

9
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:06,830
ok so I have some things I want to cover

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:11,240
the two main things that I wanted to

11
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:18,380
talk about unless we get some additional

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,720
questions are the PSF class how it works

13
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,670
what it's all about

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,390
and why you would want why we want to do

15
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,960
one and the PSM one assessment which is

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,400
the result of the PSF class that is the

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,390
assessment that you get at the end of

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,060
that class so first off the professional

19
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,960
scrum foundations class I think is one

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:46,670
of my favorite classes to teach and we

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:50,390
work together in teams so I just

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:54,560
finished a PSF with my good friend

23
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:56,630
Russell and we taught at 20 people at

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,410
one customer so it was a private private

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:03,640
class and we broke those 20 people down

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,830
into three teams so with three teams

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,209
working on the same backlog so they all

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:13,519
get given the same topic the same

29
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:16,159
backlog but they pick a team mascot and

30
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:18,620
that makes each of the things that

31
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,080
they're doing a little bit different but

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,480
they're effectively all working from the

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,950
same backlog and they actually build

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,379
software in the class that's

35
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,930
and I guess the crazy thing about the

36
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:34,720
PSF is the actually build software in

37
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,599
the class and I love that they do that

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,150
and I've taught this class in Ghana for

39
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,910
the gun a police service sorry look on

40
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,530
the police force and I had police

41
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,480
officers lighting police officers

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,489
building software in the class that had

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
never built software before we do

44
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,660
something super simple and we don't take

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,390
technology and we help people out if

46
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,670
they're struggling but the idea is

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,569
you're being creative you're building

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,090
something new and interesting I think if

49
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:07,420
I was teaching the police officers again

50
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:10,750
I would probably use something like the

51
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:14,079
scrum tail board game something of that

52
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:17,640
like where the activity the creative

53
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:24,400
activity that people are doing and is to

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:29,500
create a murder mystery novel and they

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,120
do it in an iterative fashion so I think

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,220
that would be really interesting but for

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,690
this class I tend to always default to

58
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,010
building software my background is

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,569
software engineering and it's I I guess

60
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,280
I maybe I'm a bit of a masochist my

61
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:47,230
favorite part of the course is when

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,870
folks find out they've got to build

63
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,690
software in the class and they have 30

64
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,329
minutes for their sprint length to build

65
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,310
build the software the sprints actually

66
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,850
the the the working part is 30 minutes

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,340
they have a 10 minute planning 15 minute

68
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,959
review which is split between the teams

69
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,780
because there's one review for all the

70
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:13,959
teams and then 10 minute retrospective

71
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,750
you're supposed to do four sprints and

72
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,739
when I teach this in person I have

73
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:25,120
managed to get through four Sprint's but

74
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:28,270
I think the most that I've ever done in

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,610
the virtual setting is two sprints and

76
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm planning to do something iteratively

77
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,620
getting making the class better in the

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,750
next sprint

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm gonna work with Russell next sprint

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,600
next class which is Monday Tuesday in

81
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,670
Pacific time zone which is gonna be fun

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,210
because I'm gonna be up late at least

83
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:52,500
Russell won't be up early and I'm going

84
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,690
to deliberately focus on just doing two

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,700
sprints and see how I can change the

86
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,560
dynamic in the class with that we do a

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,300
lot of really awesome exercises in the

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,810
class apart from actually building

89
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,500
software and we work a lot I actually

90
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:12,180
have one of the PCs one of the exercises

91
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,430
that we do here um let me can I make

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,130
myself a little or just disappear make

93
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,580
myself disappear there we go this is the

94
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:24,540
result of one of the longer exercises

95
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:28,710
that we do and where we build out the

96
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,920
students work together as a big group as

97
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,710
and in teams to come up with all of this

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,280
information that's on on the board here

99
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,440
so we talked about the the the three

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,480
roles in scrum and their core

101
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,270
accountabilities what we're trying to

102
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,450
get to in this class is let's make sure

103
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,210
everybody has the basic solid everybody

104
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,820
knows what our product owner is supposed

105
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,460
to be what the intent of the product

106
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,680
owner role is so then when they go back

107
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,320
to their organization they can look at

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,380
what somebody is doing in that role and

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:09,930
say well that's that's not enough that's

110
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:13,170
not going to give us the benefit that

111
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:15,270
we're trying to achieve from this idea

112
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,520
so we go through the three roles and our

113
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,330
accountabilities and we also go through

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,770
and the three artifacts which is the

115
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,360
pink things here and their transparency

116
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:32,150
so something that I've been using a lot

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,520
is a transparent past present and future

118
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,560
for the the artifacts so that you have

119
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,470
complete transparency across the life of

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,260
your project and that seems to our

121
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,990
product that seems to work pretty well

122
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,820
and has a good explanation for folks and

123
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,210
then we go into the

124
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,510
the empirical nature of each of the

125
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,700
events and the thing that I think folks

126
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,440
find super surprising about this class

127
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,260
is the number of things that they find

128
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,720
out that they were doing or that they

129
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,840
were told as part of scrum but is not

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,510
actually part of scrum and it's

131
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,020
something that people do and that's okay

132
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,760
I'm absolutely fine with complementary

133
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,250
practices that make things better for

134
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,280
groups but don't feel that you're forced

135
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,920
to do those things scrum doesn't talk

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,660
about user stories it doesn't talk about

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,750
burden downs it doesn't talk about

138
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,710
velocity and it doesn't talk about any

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,940
of those things doesn't talk about

140
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,840
standing up during the daily scrum these

141
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:38,340
are all complimentary practices the

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,350
organizations and teams may choose to

143
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,300
use as part of their endeavor and it may

144
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,930
work for them or they may want to choose

145
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,890
something different in those practices

146
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:59,550
so for example what's a good one in um

147
00:07:52,890 --> 00:08:01,890
you know when I asked myself these

148
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,220
questions I really should have an answer

149
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,590
prepared but this is office hours rather

150
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,990
than the presentation so I just wanted

151
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,630
to show you some of these things that

152
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,250
were working on but having complementary

153
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,000
practices like standing up there's a

154
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,190
good one that some teams use I have

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,090
heard of teams in Norway that their

156
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,570
daily plank

157
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,190
instead of daily stand up and it might

158
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,280
work for them it doesn't work for

159
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,849
everybody you don't have to stand up the

160
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,910
purpose of the daily scrum is an inspect

161
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,050
and adapt on the work you've done in the

162
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,960
last 24 hours

163
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:42,630
to plan or create an implementation plan

164
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,000
for the next 24 hours that's that's what

165
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,840
it is how you figure out how to do that

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,510
inside of that 15 minute event that's up

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,360
to you we can make suggestions as

168
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:57,000
coaches and trainers we often make

169
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,400
suggestions on how to fulfill that you

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,320
might in your daily scrum use the three

171
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,090
questions what did you do yesterday

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,240
what are you doing today and what are

173
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,490
you was blocking you if you were focused

174
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,820
on the individual you might focus on the

175
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,250
Sprint goal what did you do yesterday

176
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,170
they helped the team progress towards

177
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,210
the Sprint goal you might ask that or

178
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,810
you might use a practice where you're

179
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,730
looking at and a board a visualization

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,760
of the work that's going on and you look

181
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,630
at the piece of work and have a

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,780
conversation about how that work is

183
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,820
progressing and who's been working on it

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,920
and what's been happening and telling

185
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,630
telling that story that way so you can

186
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,590
focus on the people you can focus on the

187
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,610
work you can focus on the data if you're

188
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:50,010
using the professional scrum with Kanban

189
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,410
guide and adding those Kanban metrics

190
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,980
you're probably going to be looking at

191
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,050
work item aging during the daily scrum

192
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:03,690
you want to be looking at is is

193
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:06,300
something getting close to our service

194
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,450
level expectation you know we have an

195
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,070
expectation that anything we take on any

196
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,570
piece of work we take on will flow

197
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,060
through our process within a particular

198
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:19,050
time period if it's starting to reach

199
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,700
one of those boundaries then then we

200
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,050
want to have a deeper conversation about

201
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,270
it we want to talk about those things

202
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,420
other things maybe we don't have to talk

203
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,810
about they're just progressing fine so

204
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,390
that this this was a very useful

205
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,180
exercise that we do it takes quite a

206
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:39,810
considerable amount of time but it

207
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,090
allows us to focus on what the events

208
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,430
are walk that floor and answer the

209
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:48,810
questions that people have what I

210
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:53,030
usually do is I give what we had three

211
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:55,170
teams so I gave each team a team got the

212
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,050
accountabilities a team got the

213
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,690
transparencies and a team got the

214
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:04,230
empiricism and somebody from the team

215
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,330
had to say what the thing was what's

216
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,570
supposed to happen in it and then we may

217
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,450
be modified that a little bit or we

218
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,980
added more to it and and then as we

219
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,120
added more to it people started asking

220
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,950
questions

221
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,100
and cuz they're asking questions there

222
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,660
then you know doesn't doesn't this isn't

223
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,790
the scrum master the interface between

224
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,820
the development team and the product

225
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,950
owner we can have a discussion about

226
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,040
that and figure out that no way they're

227
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,529
not at the interface between the

228
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,170
development team and the scrum master so

229
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:40,140
that was a very useful exercise and it's

230
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:48,440
part of a wider set of exercises that we

231
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:51,570
use in the PSF and we had a lot of fun

232
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,410
working through everything and figuring

233
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:01,050
out what was going on so let me switch

234
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:04,580
back I would like you to feel free to

235
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:07,500
ask any questions you would like this is

236
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,779
office hours ask me anything

237
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,960
so I'm going to talk for a little while

238
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:15,750
I'm gonna hang out here if there were

239
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,270
questions asked between the last office

240
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,320
hours which was last Wednesday at 6:00

241
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,300
and this one this Wednesday at 6:00 and

242
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,850
then feel free are they're not sorry

243
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,950
then I will be asking answering chat

244
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:31,740
anything attempting to answer those

245
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:35,940
questions and feel free to ask me any

246
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:39,690
questions just now I can see the chat or

247
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:43,010
maybe I can see the chat for each of the

248
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:48,510
platforms that I'm streaming to and

249
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:50,370
obviously if you want to have if you

250
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,500
want to ask me a question but not have

251
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,890
anybody know that you've asked me that

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,560
question there's always this link here

253
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,790
if you go to Nicola doula T net forward

254
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,529
slash ask and that is an anonymous

255
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,200
question ask you will just get a text

256
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:10,950
box whatever you put in the text box is

257
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,200
in danger of me reading out so put in

258
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:15,300
there what you want me to read out and

259
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,600
then I will attempt to answer that

260
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,870
question as much as I can as I said in

261
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,839
my tweets about an hour ago I'm happy to

262
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,810
answer questions on any of the things

263
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,710
that I deal with I'm a professional

264
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,590
scrum

265
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:36,020
trainer with scrum dark but I'm also a

266
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:38,160
Microsoft MVP in DevOps so I have both

267
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,680
technical background I was a software

268
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,740
developer for ten years I was a DevOps

269
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:48,050
consultant for ten years and I've been a

270
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,910
scrum trainer for ten years as well so

271
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:54,360
that experience of working with

272
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,930
customers both in the US I spent three

273
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,250
years living in Seattle consulting there

274
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:04,200
and in Europe where I've spent the last

275
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,570
whoa seven years since 2013

276
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:14,750
who moved back from Seattle working

277
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:24,120
across here as well so back to the PSF I

278
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:26,880
will I just had a question that I had

279
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:32,130
issues attempting to install the latest

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:37,380
II do migrator - do you mean the azure

281
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:40,800
DevOps migration tool that unfortunately

282
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,470
I built not unfortunately it's a pretty

283
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,980
good tool yes I can probably help you

284
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:49,680
with that I would not be able to get

285
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,700
into the technical details in here but

286
00:14:49,680 --> 00:15:00,840
if you tweet me at at mr. hench

287
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:02,130
I'll happily help you out and I haven't

288
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,740
heard of anybody else having any

289
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,360
problems that doesn't mean there isn't

290
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,680
problems and I would need to check that

291
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,260
out somebody's having a problem

292
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,660
installing another installing the azure

293
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,540
DevOps migration tools which which I did

294
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:20,240
built so I can certainly help you out

295
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,950
with that again here tweet me and I will

296
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,060
directly help you out on my website

297
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,440
there's also a chat button and that will

298
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,160
get directly to me and you can use your

299
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:38,730
email okay Jerry no problem where was i

300
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,310
yes PSF so I really enjoy that whole

301
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,950
aspect to the PSF of level setting every

302
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:49,600
the class that I just finished teaching

303
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:53,620
Monday Tuesday was the third set of

304
00:15:49,600 --> 00:16:00,340
twenty people in the same company and we

305
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:01,300
have three more classes scheduled now so

306
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:06,390
we're going to have a total of a hundred

307
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:10,630
and twenty people going through this

308
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,540
exercise build up that level of

309
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,080
knowledge inside of the organization and

310
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:21,820
try and get to a little bit of a tipping

311
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:26,020
point if enough people understand the

312
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,880
way things could be and I'm saying could

313
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:32,830
be rather than supposed to be but could

314
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:38,350
be that they could get some benefit by

315
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:41,290
jumping in there then we can get to

316
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,540
enough people we can make that change in

317
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,310
maybe maybe try and get it to stick

318
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,160
inside the organization so training and

319
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,930
training everybody is really important

320
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,500
the organizations where I've seen

321
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:56,860
they've had the best and biggest impact

322
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,050
from this type of thing have trained our

323
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,620
very large majority of the people in the

324
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:05,199
organization I did training in Utah for

325
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,569
a company and we trained everybody in

326
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,050
the organization from the CEO all the

327
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:12,850
way down to the software engineers and

328
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,589
the guy driving the forklift in the

329
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:22,060
warehouse and that really helped set

330
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,890
that idea of how people should expect to

331
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,839
interact with software how they should

332
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,930
expect to interact in that software

333
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,400
development world and even the the guy

334
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:34,120
who drives a forklift in the warehouse

335
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,120
and he's a stakeholder to the software

336
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,360
they are they were building software

337
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,560
that um handled all of their you know

338
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,450
where everything is in the warehouse

339
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,960
their stock management their inventory

340
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,150
control their web presence so then when

341
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,980
somebody makes an order they handled the

342
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,620
whole system all the way through and

343
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,090
that was part of their value add and and

344
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,450
the guy who drives a forklift in the

345
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,960
warehouse

346
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:02,860
had a iPad attached to his forklift and

347
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,169
and he had to interface with the

348
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,929
software so one of the things he learned

349
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:11,289
going through the class and was how to

350
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,960
engage with the software team how to

351
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,730
understand why they might not be doing

352
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,519
everything you want them to do because

353
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,990
they have other priorities why you don't

354
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,970
want to be interrupting them all the

355
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:26,279
time and changing what they what they

356
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:30,250
work on but also that they he now felt

357
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:33,010
empowered to give feedback the it's

358
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,929
expected that you give feedback and we

359
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,080
as a software engineering team want your

360
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:44,980
feedback and that was a very powerful

361
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:47,799
story for for them so the PSF again is a

362
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,399
very powerful class it's really the the

363
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:55,120
101 and I want to start up doing scrum

364
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:57,100
as one reason to use it and another one

365
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,340
that I i've done quite often with

366
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,750
organizations is the we already know

367
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,760
scrum we've been doing it for a little

368
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,389
while we've picked up some bad habits

369
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,169
and maybe we need to level set again so

370
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:14,019
I've actually taught the PSF more than

371
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:16,149
once for the same group of people but

372
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,820
with a large time span in between maybe

373
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:22,029
a couple of years and that level set

374
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:27,010
really helped solidify some of those

375
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:30,340
ideas for that for that team cool so I

376
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:33,580
have completed that class I have a catch

377
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,470
up with that team in two weeks and one

378
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,980
of the reasons that I schedule a catch

379
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:42,789
up with that group of people and after

380
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,889
two weeks I call it a reify event it's

381
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:48,610
just an error and but it gives them a

382
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:51,159
chance to ask me any questions that they

383
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,380
come up with and have an actual moment

384
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,559
when they can do that when they can get

385
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:59,320
on our live call with me and do that I'm

386
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,539
quite happy always and if you were in

387
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,740
one of my classes I'm quite happy always

388
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:07,029
to engage I with those times I'm always

389
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,620
happy to answer questions that's why I

390
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:16,299
do this session as well

391
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:19,750
but the PSM one assessment is what comes

392
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:23,409
out of taking the the PSF that's the the

393
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,409
basic scrum knowledge assessment from

394
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:29,440
scrum dad org and it's included in the

395
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:33,760
PSM what PSF class as well as the PSM

396
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,960
class and one of the things that scrum

397
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,880
dan org has found is that if you if

398
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,399
people that go through the class take

399
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,710
the assessment and they're more like

400
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,380
statistically more likely to pass if

401
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,570
they take it within 14 days so they want

402
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,500
to encourage people to take it within 14

403
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,990
days so even though you know the the the

404
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,440
token you get to take the assessment has

405
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:02,460
an unlimited timeframe if you take the

406
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,320
assessment within 14 days and

407
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,130
unfortunately fail if you don't meet the

408
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,669
grade then you will get automatically

409
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,350
sent a second token to take the

410
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:16,419
assessment but only if you take it

411
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:20,620
within 14 days so that encourages people

412
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:22,570
to just just take it you know even if

413
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,610
you don't think you're ready take it

414
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,440
within that 14-day time period because

415
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,440
then you get a second attempt anyway and

416
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,570
you learn something by taking that

417
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,870
assessment the first thing you learn is

418
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,630
about your knowledge level the

419
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:40,510
assessment has a number of different

420
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:44,880
sections and each of them are scored

421
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:48,250
independently and you will see in your

422
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,049
response at which areas you did well in

423
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:53,850
which areas you didn't do so well in and

424
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:58,330
it will provide links and not only to

425
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:01,690
content but the learning path that there

426
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:05,740
is for for scrum masters as well for the

427
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:10,000
PSM one so that's a pretty handy tool

428
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,919
for you as students is just take just

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,230
take the assessment it's really that

430
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,210
simple just take it and take it within

431
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:19,779
14 days so you get a second attempt in

432
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:22,390
case you you could just oh I missed one

433
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:24,250
question or I misread it

434
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,840
that could have been your feeling

435
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,460
percentage that's not really fear

436
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,000
whereas if you get a second attempt

437
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,090
maybe that will help you out and solve

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,160
that little little problem which is

439
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,120
pretty good and so if you're prepping

440
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:44,500
for the PSM one assessment and I send

441
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:48,070
out some data to students at the end of

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,190
the class it's something that I try and

443
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:53,200
send out the same day of the class so if

444
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,750
you've been through a class for me you

445
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,320
should have it already but I send out a

446
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:03,490
link to the scrum master Learning Path

447
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:08,770
which is a web a website provided let me

448
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:13,660
a website provided by scrum dot org and

449
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:17,140
and it has a number of different areas

450
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,610
that you can dive into so for example

451
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:24,040
one of my favorites

452
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,330
done understanding and applying done you

453
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,720
can see that there's a number of

454
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:33,490
different blog posts available so these

455
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,260
ones are our blog posts you can get

456
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,300
additional content obviously reading the

457
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,220
scrum guide go look at the scrum

458
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,890
framework I'm pretty sure that will pop

459
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,260
open the poster or at least let you

460
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,380
download it massive you can get in print

461
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,530
that out massive and additional things

462
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,250
that that can get you going and if

463
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,880
you're logged in to the website which I

464
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,220
am

465
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,410
you can go tick things off and it will

466
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,570
remember things that you've done things

467
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:04,300
that you've read so that you can get a

468
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,370
better understanding of those things and

469
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,960
that's that's a pretty pretty handy tool

470
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:14,170
and I like that one and it works well

471
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,240
enough I'm not saying it's amazing yet

472
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,700
but scrum the dog are iterating on that

473
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,430
Learning Path adding more content as it

474
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,390
becomes available and potentially asking

475
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:27,640
trainers to write additional content so

476
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,590
that's that's working pretty well and

477
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,350
then there's some some links I send

478
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:35,710
around for days I Joel the agile

479
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,210
manifesto a list of the agile principles

480
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,429
while your privacy's that kind of thing

481
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:42,190
but fundamentally reading the scrum

482
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:46,960
guide is probably the most important

483
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:50,470
thing to go read and having a good

484
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,539
understanding of empiricism scrum is

485
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,899
really just an empirical process control

486
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:58,029
system so if you understand what is

487
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:59,620
trying to be achieved with an empirical

488
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,120
process control system you can better

489
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,950
understand scrum and then better

490
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,830
understand implementing it and better

491
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,080
understand how to engage with people

492
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,950
inside of your organization to help them

493
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:16,210
understand as well there's also a scrum

494
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:21,549
open assessment it's I'm pretty sure let

495
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:25,000
me ah there are open assessments for a

496
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,830
number of the different classes there's

497
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,429
a scrum open product owner open

498
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,580
development open Kanban nexus leadership

499
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:37,120
and measurement open that actually might

500
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,950
be a cool thing to do in a live session

501
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,789
would be answer some of those questions

502
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:46,600
that would be certainly a little bit

503
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,429
interesting but those things looking at

504
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,250
the mindsets and practices of scrum the

505
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:54,820
learning path reading the scrum guide

506
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:56,799
going through the material I PDF the

507
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,590
slides that we used as well as all of

508
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,120
the mural content that tool that you saw

509
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,929
with the diagram that we built was built

510
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,399
in mural with the students I PDF all of

511
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,690
that and provide it to the students at

512
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:12,640
the end of the class so that they can

513
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:19,779
review that as well yeah that's that's

514
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:23,409
really that that PSF and PSM one in a

515
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:29,520
nutshell so the next class I'm doing is

516
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:33,730
the PSF on Monday which again is another

517
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:37,240
private class but I also have scheduled

518
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:41,590
a couple of public classes as well

519
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:45,190
they're in the GMT at GMT there in the

520
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:50,070
UTC plus one British summer time at time

521
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:55,080
zone you'll find them on my

522
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:57,150
on my website you can either click class

523
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,040
schedule and but you can see they're

524
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,480
rotating around here anyway

525
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,630
and I've actually done something that I

526
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:08,700
would be good to know from you if it is

527
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:12,030
useful but I've put the UTC plus one in

528
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,800
the title so that when it goes round

529
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,480
these rotations or it appears in Google

530
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,100
you should be able to see which time

531
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,950
zone the classes are and now we've all

532
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,260
moved to virtual it's a little bit more

533
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:27,570
difficult to see how that works

534
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:31,650
so I've put up to let me pop over here

535
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,540
at two classes and I put up my they're

536
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,010
both professional agile leadership

537
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,260
classes I'm running them in the

538
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:41,790
Edinburgh timezone if that helps as well

539
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:45,150
and the one on the fourth of June is

540
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:47,790
going to be a standard today class and

541
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,650
however the one on the 29th of June I'm

542
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:53,250
going to experiment with a four day

543
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,320
class it will be four half days that

544
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,230
might be better for some folks in the

545
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,200
leadership role and we're actually gonna

546
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:05,310
start early so it's gonna be eight till

547
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,410
11:30 I think so you're done before

548
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,900
lunch you can even you know start

549
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,610
checking your emails before lunch and

550
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,380
you've got the whole afternoon to get

551
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:17,190
everything else organized I would also

552
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:23,030
be interested in feedback on on that as

553
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,030
well so hopefully that will be useful

554
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:32,190
this session and I usually do depending

555
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,570
on the amount of content in questions

556
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,960
that I've got I might do an i or might

557
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,690
do half an hour we're coming up on the

558
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,790
half hour and I have answered the only

559
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,870
question that I've had there and we've

560
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:50,360
talked about the PSF so I'm wondering if

561
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:52,800
there's not going to be any other

562
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:59,460
questions

563
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:02,570
I can hear myself somewhere hold on I've

564
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,570
got technical difficulties

565
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:14,560
oh I'm I'm a bit of a silly I I opened

566
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,680
up YouTube and I started playing this

567
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,460
video live watching it it was just a

568
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,600
little bit behind

569
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:26,350

570
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:32,980

going to do anyway at the conference

582
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,700

587
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,250
