Hello, I’m Martin Hinshelwood, and today I want to share my insights on the Professional Scrum Foundations (PSF) class and the PSM I assessment. As someone deeply entrenched in the world of Agile and DevOps, I’ve had the privilege of teaching this class numerous times, and I can confidently say it’s one of my favourites. 

### What is the Professional Scrum Foundations Class?

The PSF class is designed to provide a solid foundation in Scrum principles and practices. It’s not just about theory; it’s about practical application. During the class, participants work in teams to tackle a shared backlog, which fosters collaboration and creativity. 

- **Team Dynamics**: Recently, I co-taught a PSF class with my good friend Russell, where we had 20 participants from a single organisation. We divided them into three teams, each with their own mascot, working on the same backlog. This approach not only makes the learning process engaging but also highlights the importance of teamwork in Agile environments.

- **Hands-On Experience**: One of the most exciting aspects of the PSF is that participants actually build software during the class. I’ve taught this class to diverse groups, including police officers in Ghana, many of whom had never coded before. It’s incredible to witness their creativity and problem-solving skills as they develop software in a supportive environment.

### The Structure of the Class

The PSF class is structured around sprints, with each sprint lasting 30 minutes. Here’s a quick breakdown of the timing:

- **10 minutes** for sprint planning
- **15 minutes** for a team review
- **10 minutes** for a retrospective

While I’ve managed to complete four sprints in person, virtual settings often limit us to two. I’m currently experimenting with this format to enhance the learning experience.

### Key Learning Outcomes

Throughout the PSF, we cover essential Scrum roles, accountabilities, and artifacts. My goal is to ensure that every participant leaves with a clear understanding of:

- **Roles in Scrum**: We delve into the responsibilities of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, ensuring everyone knows what to expect from each role.

- **Artifacts and Transparency**: We discuss the importance of transparency in Scrum, using a visual representation of past, present, and future artifacts to illustrate their significance.

- **Empirical Process Control**: Participants often discover practices they’ve been using that aren’t actually part of Scrum. This is a crucial learning moment, as it allows teams to focus on what truly matters in their Agile journey.

### Preparing for the PSM I Assessment

The PSM I assessment is included in the PSF class and serves as a benchmark for your Scrum knowledge. Here are some tips for success:

- **Take the Assessment Within 14 Days**: Scrum.org has found that participants who take the assessment within two weeks of completing the PSF are statistically more likely to pass. If you don’t pass on your first attempt, you’ll receive a second token to retake it, which is a fantastic opportunity to learn and improve.

- **Utilise the Learning Path**: After the class, I provide links to the Scrum Master learning path, which includes valuable resources and blog posts. Engaging with this material will deepen your understanding of Scrum and prepare you for the assessment.

- **Read the Scrum Guide**: This is perhaps the most critical resource. A solid grasp of the Scrum framework will serve you well, not just for the assessment but in your Agile practice.

### The Impact of Training

I’ve seen firsthand how comprehensive training can transform organisations. For instance, I once trained an entire company, from the CEO to warehouse staff, in Utah. This holistic approach ensured that everyone understood their role in the software development process, fostering a culture of collaboration and feedback.

### Conclusion

The PSF class and PSM I assessment are invaluable for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of Scrum. Whether you’re new to Agile or looking to refresh your knowledge, I encourage you to consider this training.
