The depth of discussion score (0.1) is also extremely low, as the main content is extensively Scrum-centric, not OKR-centric. Intent alignments scores just 0.5 since the intent is purely Scrum training and learning of Agile practices rather than discussing structured goal-setting frameworks like OKR.
