1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:08,950
yeah I don't see you're saying I'm the

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,950
CTO at great calm

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,450
so after the Lord evaluation of

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:21,540
differences from training options we

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:24,510
selected Martin because I think he'd

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,500
bring daily perspective they very close

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,259
to what I call the weaker engineer the

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,390
dragon troublemakers and he brings a

9
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:36,180
great perspective that's close to the

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,540
makers scrum training session which is

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,520
what I thought about a lot you know

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,250
everything else about making sure the

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,050
great days of the builders are

14
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,000
successful in doing their best work and

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,780
I think Martin does a great job in

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,780
connecting with them

17
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,149
so we decided to train everybody because

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:06,729
it is critical to baseline understanding

19
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:10,780
of scrum in the organization what I

20
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:12,159
expected every shop is that you start

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,289
with following the standard framework

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,960
and use one and you create a variation

23
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:17,710
facts we should create a normal and

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,170
expecting

25
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,750
it's just that in an organization where

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,210
you have a lot of new people joining the

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,310
organization everybody bring their own

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:31,649
flavor and understanding of what's come

29
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:41,100
and agile means and it creates more

30
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:41,100
dissonance so we come to create

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,680
by the feedback that they received for

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:53,920
training from all the lab students and

33
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,410
then maybe process and so dad I think it

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,780
resonates in everybody that margin is

35
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,330
very close to the makers in the village

36
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,950
and that shows and how he teaches a

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,610
class and that's pretty consistent

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,610
feedback

39
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,930
the ICMS value in the organizational

40
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,670
change backlog that comes out of the

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:23,100
training it is the team getting us would

42
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,100
we need to change in relationship

43
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:38,440
reorganization and big initiative makes

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,690
my mother to bots to expectation after

45
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,460
the training is my expecting the

46
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,680
organization should change its senior

47
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:48,130
levels which is what the organization

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,260
macron is about and the other is that

49
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,300
individual team should be sure are

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:03:01,110
talking to different that are one that

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:01,110
is one individual folder

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:11,560
my belief is that this training in the

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:16,340
air hoist that father would help us

54
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:21,010
improve our on to true coat and crumbs

55
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:24,770
off both just delivery ie getting the

56
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,800
shipment out of the door gate laces how

57
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,400
the world is only not more feature from

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:35,180
strategy for customers but also to put

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:51,890
in turns off the needle of the business

60
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:54,140
metric that reason the only thing I

61
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,260
reading but you know when I first took

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,300
the password margin few years ago at my

63
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,750
previous game I personally took the

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,570
class and I was very impressed because

65
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,340
again I think I am still an engineer at

66
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:13,489
hide and connected me so that hole cut

67
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,200
God in the name of modern among the

68
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,730
candidate Cheney and I'm glad that the

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,940
feedback I've gotten so far it's very

70
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:28,669
consistent from the team great job but

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,380
Monahan great job from our team left

72
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,380
naked Martin to come here
