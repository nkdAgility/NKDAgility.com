As the CTO at Great Calm, I’ve had the privilege of witnessing the transformative power of effective training in Scrum. Recently, we undertook a significant initiative to baseline our understanding of Scrum across the organisation. This decision stemmed from a recognition that, in a rapidly evolving environment, everyone brings their own flavour and understanding of what Scrum and Agile mean. This diversity can create dissonance, which is why we chose to engage with Martin Hinshelwood for our training sessions.

### Why We Chose Martin

I’ve always believed that the best training comes from someone who is not only knowledgeable but also deeply connected to the makers—the engineers and developers who are at the heart of our projects. Martin embodies this connection. His approach resonates with the team, as he brings a daily perspective that aligns closely with the challenges faced by our engineers. 

Here’s what I found particularly compelling about Martin’s training:

- **Real-World Relevance**: Martin’s insights are grounded in real-world experience. He understands the nuances of engineering and the common pitfalls that teams encounter.
- **Engagement with Participants**: Feedback from our team highlighted how Martin’s teaching style fosters an environment of collaboration and open dialogue. He connects with participants, making the learning experience both enjoyable and impactful.
- **Focus on Continuous Improvement**: Martin emphasises the importance of starting with the standard Scrum framework and then iterating based on the unique needs of the organisation. This approach encourages teams to adapt and evolve, rather than simply following a prescribed method.

### The Impact of Training

The training sessions were not just about learning the mechanics of Scrum; they were about instilling a mindset of agility and collaboration. Post-training, I expect to see significant changes at both the senior levels of our organisation and within individual teams. Here’s what I envision:

- **Enhanced Communication**: Teams should be engaging in more meaningful conversations, breaking down silos and fostering a culture of transparency.
- **Alignment with Business Goals**: The training will help us align our delivery with strategic objectives, ensuring that we are not just shipping features but also driving business metrics that matter.
- **Empowerment of Teams**: By equipping our teams with a solid understanding of Scrum, we empower them to take ownership of their processes and outcomes.

### Personal Reflections

Reflecting on my own journey, I remember the first time I took a Scrum training course. I was impressed by the depth of knowledge and the practical applications that were shared. It was a pivotal moment for me, reinforcing my belief in the importance of continuous learning and adaptation. 

I’m thrilled to see that the feedback from our recent training sessions has been overwhelmingly positive. The team has expressed appreciation for Martin’s approach, and I’m confident that this will lead to meaningful changes in how we operate.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, investing in training is not just about ticking a box; it’s about fostering a culture of agility and continuous improvement. As we move forward, I’m excited to see how the insights gained from Martin’s sessions will shape our organisation and enhance our ability to deliver value to our customers. 

Let’s embrace this journey together, ensuring that we not only understand Scrum but also live its principles in our daily work. After all, it’s not just about the framework; it’s about the people who make it come alive.
