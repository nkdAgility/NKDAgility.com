# nkdAgility Healthgrades Interview CJSingh

Martin Hinshelwood trained over 150 people at Healthgrades in the fundamentals of Scrum.

At the end of the course we get an Organisational Change backlog that sets the entire organisation on a course of self correction to a higher degree of business agility.
