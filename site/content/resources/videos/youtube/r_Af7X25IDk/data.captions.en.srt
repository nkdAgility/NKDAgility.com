session on Tuesday where I will answer

9
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:05,830
any of those questions that I can I want

10
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:08,900
to do a little call out to my

11
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,750
professional agile leadership class that

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,840
is running on Monday this is a virtual

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,409
live virtual classroom we currently have

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,750
six people and we're going to be talking

15
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:27,080
about the the movement for management

16
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:30,230
from that that management traditional

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:34,340
management style over to leadership and

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:40,120
what that means today I'm going to talk

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:42,170
about a few things in this leadership

20
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,180
presentation so I want to talk about

21
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,490
what what the problem is and where it

22
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,400
comes from I want to talk about that

23
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:54,540
the who the what and the how and how we

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,650
can organize some of those things and

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,650
get them let's get started

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,340
naked agility is available for DevOps

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,870

contact us for a free consultation

29
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:20,359
okay so the first thing to talk about a

30
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:23,659
little bit is um what the problem is and

31
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:29,090
really it's around that idea that things

32
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:32,810
have changed and not just because of the

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,099
current situation with kovat at 19 this

34
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,349
is something that has been happening

35
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:40,069
over the last 15 years the world has

36
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:42,889
been changing very quickly and firms

37
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:46,129
companies have been really struggling to

38
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:50,530
keep up with that floor some of that

39
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:52,909
floor has come from and that idea of the

40
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:58,250
expectation from users if you're in the

41
00:02:52,909 --> 00:03:00,889
commercial world of delivering value to

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,189
them a little bit more quickly and some

43
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:07,370
of that has come from those users then

44
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:10,700
being in organizations and expecting

45
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,889
more from their employer whether that be

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,540
they want to bring their own device

47
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,329
rather than use the corporate device so

48
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,849
they want more freedom on the network

49
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,650
more freedom to do things inside of the

50
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,979
organization to have ideas and move

51
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,620
forward that's that's really what what

52
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:30,049
what that difference is companies today

53
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,159
need to be able to take advantage of

54
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:37,099
things that change in the market market

55
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,159
opportunities or difficulties like the

56
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:42,560
current situation and in months or weeks

57
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,720
instead of years and I think that's

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,449
something that you're seeing a lot of

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,930
companies struggling with now that move

60
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:53,239
to home working where maybe before they

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,290
were we're not going to do any sort of

62
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:01,609
home working and then struggling to to

63
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,150
really get that in working times have

64
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,489
changed

65
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:10,220
effectively and they've changed very

66
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:13,250
much in the last few weeks at so I'm

67
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,139
going to talk more than from kovat

68
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:20,079
perspective this is a presentation that

69
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:25,360
I did at M agile in Africa in 2017

70
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,370
for my good friend Nana and I thought it

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,949
would be a useful presentation in these

72
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:35,319
in these dire circumstances that we're

73
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:40,330
in so I'm gonna be focusing on product

74
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:43,750
and I'd like you to think about this

75
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,830
let's say we've got two two groups that

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,680
are building a product one group a group

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,259
a has a business plan they are well

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,069
established in the market they're well

79
00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:00,430
funded and they hire the best people

80
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:04,360
okay that's that's one group the second

81
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,669
group B people are going to be working

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,590
for free we're not gonna pay the people

83
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,909
that are doing the work they're gonna do

84
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,400
it in their spare time

85
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:15,430
fire the goodness of their heart just

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,000
because they want to so which of these

87
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,480
do you think would be more likely to be

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,630
successful

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,740
if you're an additional mindset you're

90
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:34,140
gonna be gravitating very hard eh and

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:36,390
but II was in fact a large product

92
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,330
called in Carta Microsoft Encarta which

93
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:42,660
some of you may remember um and Group B

94
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,660
was Wikipedia and the thing that I find

95
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,890
that kind of funny is the Wikipedia

96
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,310
entry for Microsoft Encarta at Mike's of

97
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,550
Encarta was a digital multimedia

98
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,580
encyclopedia they just couldn't keep up

99
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,550
with the change they deployed their

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,460
application on a disk physical disk that

101
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,580
was sent out to your many physical disks

102
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:12,180
as it were and it was just impossible to

103
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,940
keep up with the change in the world and

104
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,400
Wikipedia and Wikipedia one because they

105
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,490
had the most up-to-date data but people

106
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,830
give up their time for free I'm

107
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:28,290
wondering if you can think of any other

108
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:33,030
companies that have really struggled and

109
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:36,690
maybe completely gone out of business

110
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:39,960
I was thinking maybe of Bob Buster

111
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,420
that's a very common one it was funny

112
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,420
the the blockbuster was represented in

113
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,050
the and what was the the the movie the

114
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,540
Captain Marvel movie you saw Helen

115
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,970
didn't have blockbuster at the start and

116
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,270
that's that's it's just it doesn't exist

117
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:01,200
anymore I think I seem to remember an

118
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,820
article where the blockbuster CEO said

119
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,990
he didn't believe that anybody would

120
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,140
want to stream movies and that was a

121
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:15,030
couple of years before Netflix came on

122
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:17,760
the scene I was also at Kodak for those

123
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,550
that don't know Kodak is still around

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,610
and they aren't doing really photography

125
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,680
and stuff anymore they're doing

126
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,970
blockchain because if you can't figure

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,570
out what to do and you got to reinvent

128
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,750
your business look Jane apparently but

129
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,860
Kodak the Kodak invented the digital

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,580
camera

131
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:41,099
more than 50 years ago they decided that

132
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,789
they would bury that technology in order

133
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,169
to protect their film business which was

134
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:48,780
the most profitable part of the business

135
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,819
so they buried a new innovation but the

136
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,979
problem is once something's discovered

137
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,960
it doesn't go away somebody else is

138
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,400
going to discover it again they're going

139
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,099
to go down the same routes and maybe

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,680
come up with a better product if you

141
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,139
don't get to market with the ideas that

142
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,409
you've got even if they're going to

143
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,599
disrupt your existing business then you

144
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:13,099
you you're going to run into problems

145
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,090
that annoying also really we have this

146
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,620
challenge we have a number of a number

147
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,319
of challenges that I'm going to talk

148
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,069
about and in the what the WHO and the

149
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:27,539
how but we have somebody with an idea

150
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:29,009
who creates who creates an idea I've got

151
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,010
something I want to go build something

152
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,719
problem I want to go solve and we go off

153
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,360
when we create a product and release it

154
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,449
to customers and then the either like it

155
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,060
or they hate it a good example of

156
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:46,140
customers not liking the thing that was

157
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:51,199
delivered was Windows 8 Windows 8 was

158
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:54,930
released and people there was a massive

159
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,680
expectations gap between the product and

160
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:00,240
what people perceived that they wanted

161
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,740
so max I've had to roll back a lot of

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,220
the changes that they made in Windows 8

163
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,230
and in the UI in order to appease some

164
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,529
very unhappy customers and to get higher

165
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,860
levels of adoption and that's

166
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:16,410
unfortunate it was a good product it

167
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,209
just had a mismatch between what people

168
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,790
want eaten and what they got so they got

169
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,110
a lot of negative feedback from

170
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,829
customers but you might also get

171
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,050
positive feedback so we have a number of

172
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:30,750
variables they want to look at in the

173
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,269
what WHO and the how and the first one

174
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:36,470
until the cat is the the challenges in

175
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,470
the what space

176
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:45,730
the idea that we have to decide what

177
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,700
we're going to build in detail up front

178
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:52,940
is definitely an old tailor istic

179
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:56,360
practice you should go read my are sorry

180
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,660
watch my video on how to detect a duel

181
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,440
[Â __Â ] and the tyranny of Taylorism

182
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,630
but in the what challenges fifty sorry

183
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,910
fifty sixty five percent of

184
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,190
functionality that you build it will not

185
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,890
be used by your customers this is data

186
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,940
is based on a report from the Standish

187
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:19,810
group in Boston they collect data on 70

188
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:25,610
odd thousand projects around the world

189
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:27,650
and the the averages are 65% you might

190
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,940
be better than that you might be a lot

191
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,630
worse than that

192
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:39,200
but that lack of focus on the the

193
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,870
strategy of the product and is what's

194
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,070
causing that rather than building things

195
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,020
that are strategically going to achieve

196
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,240
pieces of value for your customers a lot

197
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,620
of organizations are just building a

198
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,450
bunch of stuff without really

199
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:00,339
understanding that relationship between

200
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,339
that because we're used to those long

201
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:09,290
detailed elaborate product backlogs

202
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:12,290
where you you I go into organizations

203
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,030
all the time and this I say can you show

204
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,550
me your product backlog and they pop up

205
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:19,520
in the product backlog and those 5,000

206
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,710
things in the product backlog there's no

207
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,290
way that a product owner that somebody's

208
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,120
setting strategy and direction can even

209
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,040
remotely understand what's in there

210
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,600
which means they then have to have an

211
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,910
army of minions to spelunk

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,870
all of that data and figure out what

213
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:41,570
might be important but those people

214
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:44,060
looking at the the minions are going to

215
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,490
be surfacing all the things they think

216
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,730
is important which they might not have

217
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,940
as much information and

218
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,250
as the the product owner or as the the

219
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,649
person who is setting that strategic

220
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,779
goal so ultimately because we have these

221
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,470
big backlogs or a lot of organizations

222
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:04,240
have these big backlogs 35% of your

223
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,050
requirements are going to change over

224
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,690
the life of your project and that's just

225
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:14,410
reality 35% is going to change

226
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,510
so if 65% is not used 35% is going to

227
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:21,310
change that's not a really good picture

228
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:26,760
and some of that comes from not really

229
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:29,589
having a good description or definition

230
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,579
around the responsibilities of product

231
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:36,010
management what are they actually

232
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:39,639
supposed to do and also whether you have

233
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,079
somebody who is has the role of product

234
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,110
owner or you have that term in your

235
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:46,510
organization or not you have people in

236
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,089
your organization who are fully fiscally

237
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,540
accountable for delivering value based

238
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:57,329
on the money spent those folks I would

239
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:59,980
call product owners and but often that

240
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:04,660
accountability is delegated to people

241
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:07,630
who are weak or not authorized to be

242
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,019
able to make the decisions that they

243
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,670
need to make in order to live for your

244
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:16,180
organization to get a significant amount

245
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,540
of value from that and ultimately we

246
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:23,440
have this focus on project rather than

247
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:26,889
product I'm not saying that you can't

248
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,699
have a project you absolutely can but

249
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:34,269
the overall strategic focus should be on

250
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:36,550
delivering value in a product projects

251
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:41,829
are time limited very definition of

252
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:43,630
project and if you are as an individual

253
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:46,810
or accountable for delivering something

254
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,110
in a time limited fashion you're

255
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:53,260
interested in getting that thing done

256
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,630
but there might be choices that are made

257
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,019
during the life of that project that are

258
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:02,320
detrimental to the overall product and

259
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,680
it's very common for large

260
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,889
projects that are going to result in an

261
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,259
ongoing product or be added to an

262
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,360
existing product to result in

263
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:16,149
significant additional levels of

264
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,449
technical debt and additional levels of

265
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:22,180
complexity and really things that don't

266
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:24,670
need to be there part of that 65% of the

267
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,329
functionality not used we delivered that

268
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:31,740
functionality 65% of it wasn't used so

269
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:34,930
did we look back round figure out which

270
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,779
65% is not used and take those things

271
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,519
out and leaving stuff in your product

272
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:43,480
means you've got to support it maintain

273
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,970
it it's care and feeding you want to get

274
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,029
them out if you can and that idea of

275
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:53,860
those long long cycles many

276
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,259
organizations still deliver less than

277
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,839
once a year

278
00:14:55,259 --> 00:15:00,880
organizations can be 2 or 3 years

279
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,250
between releases still for some large

280
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,990
organizations but large products but

281
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,089
many organizations are moving to quicker

282
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,870
delivery quickly delivery does not

283
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:15,399
necessarily mean once a quarter quicker

284
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,920
delivery in the the agile space is 30

285
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,380
days or less you should be delivering

286
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,779
your product into production at least

287
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,449
every 30 days in order to solve some of

288
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:28,600
those problems but that's not common in

289
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:32,680
the industry yet we're going to talk

290
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:37,660
about that so then we have some problems

291
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:40,779
around who is doing the work or the the

292
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:46,139
people problems who is going to be doing

293
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:49,300
the work and so having an effective

294
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:52,000
change transition management ie we've

295
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,139
got a bunch of things we're doing things

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,040
change things are different than we

297
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:02,050
expect how is that communicated across

298
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,490
the organization how do you make sure

299
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:07,839
that and when the the engineers are

300
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,009
actually doing the work can they find

301
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,139
out things are a little bit different

302
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,959
than they expected to be that's filtered

303
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,100
back to through the layers that you've

304
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,190
got in your organization to your

305
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,760
customer

306
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:23,800
then and also the resultant information

307
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:27,560
is then transitioned back the other way

308
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:31,490
organizations on average lose 50% of

309
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,030
their time for ineffective collaboration

310
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:40,610
and basically the the handoffs being

311
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:43,100
being very inefficient ineffective this

312
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,540
idea of servant leadership and I think

313
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,240
servant leadership is often

314
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,310
misunderstood and it's not about just

315
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,950
getting getting the coffee or doing

316
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,730
things for your team it's about creating

317
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,890
an environment within which your team

318
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,080
can be as effective and efficient as

319
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,570
possible

320
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,939
and that is often very lacking in

321
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,500
organizations that's why an effective

322
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,300
servant leadership there might be

323
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,199
servant leadership but is it actually

324
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:16,670
effective and then having a misalignment

325
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:20,030
of objectives are we going at all going

326
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,069
in the same direction and are we focused

327
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,839
on delivering the value that our

328
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:27,650
customers need in our product in order

329
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:32,090
to increase our market share in order to

330
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:34,580
deliver that value and that will give us

331
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:37,820
the thing we need and contributing to

332
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:43,040
that 50% of an effective communication

333
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,810
and is unimpaired scrum masters can they

334
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,050
can't they maybe know what they should

335
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,120
be doing but they can't do it those of

336
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,730
the organizational bureaucracy that is

337
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:56,180
there maybe they're ineffective in the

338
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,100
first place and a lot of complexity

339
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,760
around who makes the decisions how those

340
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,620
decisions are made how many stakeholders

341
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,950
have their finger in the pie is that

342
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,880
where to get things done so that's a big

343
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:15,220
who challenge losing 50% of our time for

344
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,220
for that kind of collaboration problem

345
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:26,350
the other other big area is how I'm

346
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:28,660
really the biggest issue in the whole

347
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,210
world is this thing that we call

348
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:35,050
technical debt technical debt isn't

349
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,820
always the best name to use it depends

350
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,020
who you're talking to and their

351
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:44,190
understanding of the world and of

352
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:50,020
finances I've worked with a number of

353
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:52,960
CFO's who have told me that technical

354
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,940
debt it's not the best thing you can

355
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,510
call it because ultimately technical

356
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,940
debt is not what sorry that is not all

357
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,450
bad we have mortgages we have loans for

358
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,730
cars

359
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,870
you might take a loan out to get your

360
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:11,010
your sofa and paid off over a couple of

361
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:15,720
years those are not necessarily bad

362
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:18,580
debts however all technical debt is bad

363
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,130
you'd be better at thinking of it as an

364
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,530
unhedged fund for those that are

365
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,760
technically monday minded you've got an

366
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:30,220
uninsured risk effectively in your

367
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,200
product you have risk in know no

368
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:38,910
mitigation and this can technical debt

369
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,430
can take lots of different forms and I

370
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,550
usually sum it up by saying anything

371
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:49,690
that is difficult or anything that is

372
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:52,470
manual are all of that is technical debt

373
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,270
but if you have any manual processes

374
00:19:52,470 --> 00:20:00,390
between your your software coder

375
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:05,530
committing code to your repository to

376
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,690
getting that item into production then

377
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,400
you have technical debt that could be

378
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,310
manual testing that could be manual

379
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,610
environment provision provisioning

380
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:18,040
manual deployments manual anything

381
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,160
anything manual anything that's

382
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:26,440
difficult if you're wondering why it

383
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:29,259
takes so long for your engineers

384
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,110
get things done when maybe when your

385
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,610
product was was new and green it was

386
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,320
very easy to get things done it's

387
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,960
because there hasn't been enough care

388
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,799
taken about how things are written how

389
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,990
things look and how repeatable things

390
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,919
are can I go back and edit and

391
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:51,909
understand this part of the system

392
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:56,889
easily have I made changes to the system

393
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:59,519
to allow that to be easy easy easy to

394
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:01,600
read easy to understand easy to change

395
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,240
and the software will call that

396
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,070
refactoring refactoring is something

397
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,649
that should be going on all the time it

398
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,299
should not be an optional thing that

399
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,179
somebody decides to do or not it should

400
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:16,500
just be how we work just like if you

401
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:19,809
were going to release our press release

402
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,549
you were going to some big announcement

403
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:26,980
for your organization that was maybe a

404
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:28,899
little bit controversial or could be a

405
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,750
little bit controversial I'm are you

406
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:35,710
just going to write those things down

407
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,570
are you going to write that press

408
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:42,120
release and Shepherd Act you just gonna

409
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:44,889
email it to everybody I would hope not

410
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,470
you're probably going to reread that

411
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:50,080
thing make some changes to make it make

412
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,360
more sense you're maybe going to loop in

413
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,100
one of your colleagues and say is this

414
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,879
on message is this the thing I'm trying

415
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,289
to get across quit this be misunderstood

416
00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:00,909
and then you're gonna go through some

417
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,799
more iterations and then maybe you'll

418
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,269
look pen at somebody else in your

419
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,559
organization look then somebody from

420
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,909
marketing loop in somebody from

421
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,100
engineering look and somebody from

422
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:13,720
contracts from legal from sale all of

423
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:17,019
those departments make sure it looks

424
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,009
like it says exactly what we want as an

425
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:23,169
organization to present and then we'll

426
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:25,330
release the press release so there was a

427
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:27,669
lot of refactoring there going back over

428
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,320
the things that we had done to make them

429
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,990
make them better make them easier to

430
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,100
read easier to understand same applies

431
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,059
to everything we do

432
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:44,850
so we talked about a lot of problems and

433
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:47,759
this results in a lot of loss so what

434
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:49,169
what does that look like if you crunch

435
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:53,269
the numbers a little bit

436
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:57,659
so I again I lasted this presentation in

437
00:22:53,269 --> 00:23:00,570
Ghana in Africa and I have Canadian

438
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:04,139
cities as my currency there but you can

439
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,210
think of any you can put any currency in

440
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:10,110
in that space and the numbers meet the

441
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,360
same so if I have 500 cities pounds

442
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:16,289
dollars at whatever it is and I'm going

443
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:20,129
to invest that in my product I'm gonna

444
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:22,350
get my engineers to build something what

445
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:26,570
does that what does that look like well

446
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:29,370
if I lose thirty five percent for

447
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,289
building the right features yeah

448
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,230
so I sixty five percent of my features

449
00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:36,509
are used little effort by my customers

450
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:41,370
and then thirty five percent are the

451
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:45,779
right features so we've spent a hundred

452
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:51,019
and seventy five cities pounds dollars

453
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:53,279
on delivering actual value if we lose

454
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,429
fifty percent for effective

455
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,009
communication and collaboration what

456
00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:02,610
does what does that look like well 50%

457
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:04,799
of our 175 that we had at left is eighty

458
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:09,179
seven and a half so we get eighty seven

459
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:13,740
and a half pound cities or dollars and

460
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:18,029
then we spend thirty percent of our time

461
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:21,090
on average building new features there

462
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:25,529
see struggling with technical debt so

463
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:28,080
that's the complexities of the thing

464
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,370
that we've written the the difficulty in

465
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,649
understanding the thing that we've

466
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,919
written of the manual error-prone

467
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:37,049
process is that we've got results and we

468
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,360
are only able to spend about 30 percent

469
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,549
of our time adding value to our product

470
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,240
certainly percent every time cause just

471
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:47,840
struggling with complexity that's all

472
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,350
we're left with twenty six

473
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:55,159
and a quarter but 26 and a quarter and

474
00:24:51,350 --> 00:25:00,289
out of our 500 so what does that look

475
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:02,679
like on $50,000 that looks like two

476
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:07,549
thousand six hundred and twenty-five

477
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:09,490
dollars and I'm not sure that's I've

478
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:12,230
violated return on investment and

479
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,260
anybody's eyes hopefully in your

480
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,880
business it's not and this is why the

481
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,169
business is concerned about the amount

482
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,080
of value that they get for their

483
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:23,840
investment in the software world and why

484
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,240
the software world is often considered a

485
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,740
cost center rather than a profit Center

486
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,090
which it should be we need to address

487
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,750
some of these things we need to change

488
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:39,580
these numbers in our favor and that can

489
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:43,940
be super difficult so I've got some

490
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:47,980
suggestions that are pretty hopefully

491
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:51,110
there they make sense for you the first

492
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,140
suggestion is around or suggestions are

493
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,179
around the what the value that we

494
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,840
delivered the first one is to try and

495
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:03,020
focus a little bit on product rather

496
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,270
than project so while you can have a

497
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:09,919
bunch of projects going on inside our

498
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:14,120
product and make sure that decisions are

499
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,100
made based on the outcomes and changes

500
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:22,399
in behavior you want your customers to

501
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:24,770
have rather than on delivering on a set

502
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,679
of items delivering on a set of items

503
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,380
does not necessarily provide value to

504
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,770
your customer focus on the value and

505
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,779
hopefully you can make some shift shift

506
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:39,770
those percentages so we spend more time

507
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,559
delivering the things that we really

508
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:45,470
needed last time working on things that

509
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,309
we our customers aren't going to

510
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,309
actually use

511
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:55,620
have a product owner have somebody with

512
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:58,830
full fiscal accountability or delivering

513
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,260
value in your product at the to be

514
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,690
accountable for maximizing value there

515
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,450
should be solely responsible for the

516
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,830
backlog so don't second-guess them you

517
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,470
might not like some of the decisions

518
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,169
that they make that's sometimes just the

519
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,549
way it is there they're thinking about

520
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:19,409
they're taking a bunch of information in

521
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:22,770
from market competitors what the board

522
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:25,980
wants what stakeholders want they have a

523
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:29,000
lot of information and they're making a

524
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,549
decision holistically for the best

525
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,860
result in the product based on that so

526
00:27:32,549 --> 00:27:37,260
ultimately you can get an inadequate

527
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,120
return on investment maybe you want to

528
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,530
stop funding that project if you're not

529
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,490
getting the return on investment that

530
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:48,510
you're expecting maybe the pro toner

531
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:51,390
needs more teams to work against the

532
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,590
product you need a new product owner but

533
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,720
they need to be empowered to make

534
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,919
decisions about the product and nobody

535
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,870
else should be able to tell the

536
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,390
development team what to do effectively

537
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,760
a product owner hires the development

538
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,520
team the development team hires the

539
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,020
scrum master and that's that's the the

540
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:13,520
chain of hierarchy within the agile

541
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,590
world and specifically in scrum now

542
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,480
caveat everything I say with it has to

543
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,970
work within the context of your

544
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,799
organizational constraints you're going

545
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,320
to have you have a unique organization

546
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,700
that you work in you're going to have to

547
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,380
decide how you want this to work

548
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,520
depending on that organizational

549
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,200
constraint might be some things you

550
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,669
can't change but maybe there are things

551
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:41,580
that are inhibiting your team and your

552
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:42,929
organization's ability to adopt some of

553
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,280
these practices and those are maybe

554
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:47,280
things you want to address maybe you

555
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,559
need to bring HR into a discussion

556
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,179
around what what do we need to do

557
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,350
differently maybe you want to bring

558
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,990
sales and maybe you want to bring

559
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,710
contracts in make sure everybody's

560
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,200
involved in looking the outcomes you're

561
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:02,610
trying to achieve so don't think of

562
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
agility as

563
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,120
thing you're trying to achieve this is

564
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,880
you want to get specific strategic

565
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,460
outcomes for your business and how are

566
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,559
you going to work towards those

567
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,910
strategic outcomes and maybe these tools

568
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,290
are going to going to help you with that

569
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:23,520
because ultimately we do still have to

570
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:26,700
do planning and it it's important for

571
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,360
the business to understand where we are

572
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,120
where we're going how long we think

573
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,190
we're going to take to get there and

574
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,410
that needs to be okay

575
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,500
those are answers that we need to be

576
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:43,559
able to provide for the for the for the

577
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,660
business its how business gets done so

578
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:48,750
we have to be able to provide them but

579
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:53,780
we want to change the way we look at

580
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:57,320
those things this is from a

581
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:00,510
complimentary practice from the way

582
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:04,020
Microsoft is currently doing they're at

583
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:06,419
long-term vision and planning you can

584
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,070
use bits of this you could use all of it

585
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:11,160
you could use something else that's okay

586
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:14,130
this is just an example so here they've

587
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,990
got three week Sprint's this is for a

588
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,360
particular team there's your dev ops

589
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,340
team like Microsoft they do three week

590
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:27,470
Sprint's and then they plan over three

591
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:31,130
three Sprint's so that's nine weeks

592
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,240
planning they understand more or less

593
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,700
what it is they're going to be doing

594
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,530
over those nine weeks beyond that

595
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,910
they're not so sure but inside of those

596
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,070
nine weeks they have a reasonable

597
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:43,740
understanding and then they have this

598
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,390
seasoned model so six months seasoned

599
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,040
model you'll hear Microsoft talking

600
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:51,960
about the the fall and spring updates

601
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,669
from any of their products that's based

602
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,370
on this seasoned model so they have a

603
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,950
six month what are we trying to achieve

604
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,770
in those six months and then they have a

605
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:04,440
12 to 18 month strategy here are the

606
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,630
high level objectives that we're trying

607
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,080
to get to

608
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:14,370
then they'll reassess those on a 12 to

609
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,440
18 month basis reassess the features

610
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:19,230
they're going to deliver towards those

611
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,760
strategic objectives in a six month

612
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:25,950
cycle Andrea saw assess the individual

613
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,900
things they're going to add to the

614
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:34,320
product the implementation plan on that

615
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:37,050
three Sprint's three weeks basis so

616
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,750
ultimately in their world the team is

617
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:42,240
responsible for the detail so the the

618
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,400
scrum team which includes the product

619
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,540
owner for that for that team and are

620
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:52,500
responsible for the Sprint the plan and

621
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:54,330
a good way into the season what are we

622
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,790
actually going to do what are we going

623
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,060
to implement in the product and what are

624
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:01,410
the the things we're going to go build

625
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,420
but leadership is responsible for

626
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,130
setting strategic direction to make sure

627
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,500
that we're all going in the same

628
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:12,990
direction they need to set that and

629
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:14,760
decide what what are we what are we

630
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,740
investing in where are we spending our

631
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:23,040
money holistically ultimately we need to

632
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:26,940
shorten as much of our feedback loops as

633
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:28,890
possible and the quicker we know we're

634
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,390
building the wrong thing the quicker we

635
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,760
can stop building the wrong thing and

636
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,470
build the right thing the worker we can

637
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,840
find out that something that we are

638
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,360
going to build is right or wrong or

639
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,000
needs to go in a different direction the

640
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,090
better so we want to be able to get into

641
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that loop of delivering as quickly as

642
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,730
possible and this particular group this

643
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,210
team delivers to production every three

644
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:56,430
weeks so every single sprint goes to

645
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:59,190
production so they're able to get the

646
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:01,470
output of the work they just did in the

647
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,480
current three weeks in front of the

648
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:05,460
customer during those three weeks they

649
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,950
actually do continuous delivery and and

650
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,240
then get feedback from them right away

651
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:14,310
as soon as users are able to use that so

652
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,590
we want to shorten those feedback loops

653
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,759
by shortening the time to market in

654
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,249
order to really

655
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:24,789
understand how those things are

656
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:28,449
happening you want to be able to get an

657
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:33,999
understanding of what's going on in

658
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:35,859
these four areas the specific metrics

659
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:39,070
that you measure are going to be up to

660
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:42,219
you but you want to make sure that

661
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:45,070
you're looking and at what's your

662
00:33:42,219 --> 00:33:47,589
organizational capability and how do we

663
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:50,409
improve that so the first part is time

664
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:52,809
to market obviously how quickly we're

665
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:55,119
getting our product out to our users and

666
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:56,859
we might have a bunch of metrics that

667
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,079
we're going to monitor those metrics are

668
00:33:56,859 --> 00:34:00,879
going to change over time as we get

669
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,819
better some metrics become less

670
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:06,219
meaningful if we're in continuous

671
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:07,839
delivery how quickly we delivered the

672
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:10,629
customers maybe become such a small

673
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,980
number that it doesn't matter anymore we

674
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:14,559
also want to look at our ability to

675
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,500
innovate and in our ability to innovate

676
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,829
we're looking at are struggling with

677
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,740
complexity there sees new features in

678
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:25,720
production our ability to add stuff to

679
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,230
our product baracy struggling with

680
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,029
complexity sets our organizational

681
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,509
capability and then we also want to look

682
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:37,149
at the the market we want to look at the

683
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:39,399
current value that we're delivering how

684
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:41,769
do we know that the things that we're

685
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,109
creating are providing value to our

686
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:47,529
customers how do we assess that value

687
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:49,000
and increase work to increase that value

688
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:51,429
that's one thing

689
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,240
Abaddon's you've also got unrealized

690
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:59,200
value that's effectively opportunities

691
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:03,309
you either weren't able to go after or

692
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,299
or didn't didn't know about didn't know

693
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:08,049
about one's a little bit difficult to

694
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:11,289
measure but the unrealized value is

695
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:14,220
important to balance out at that picture

696
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,220
of what's happening in the future

697
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:24,420
so increasing value and in the what

698
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:27,319
space is all about product not project

699
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,329
although projects may be going on and

700
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,710
one decision-maker called the product

701
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:34,250
owner you can call them whatever you

702
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,630
want the rule is the product owner

703
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,549
regular planning and realignment so

704
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,730
instead of having a long term plan have

705
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:45,869
much shorter plans usually three to nine

706
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:49,109
weeks and have them cycle through I am

707
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:51,270
most the most common cadence I've seen

708
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:54,720
for that realignment of planning is two

709
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:57,990
weeks sprint of two weeks is this is the

710
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,690
normal now it used to be 30 days a month

711
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,849
us what the scrum guy talks about part

712
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,609
of that is because technology has

713
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:08,160
changed over the last 20 years that

714
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:10,289
scrum has been around 20 years ago it

715
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,480
was really hard to ship your product to

716
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:15,390
production on a continuous basis today

717
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,730
it's easy to ship your product to

718
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,460
production on a continuous basis and I

719
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,349
teach a class called the professional

720
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,079
scrum foundations class in the

721
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:27,180
professional scrum foundations class and

722
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,160
the team's this class is designed for

723
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,170
for everybody in your organization but

724
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,770
you need at least one software engineer

725
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,970
per team per team of five so one in five

726
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,940
people in the class is a software

727
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,980
engineer you can do it and and we build

728
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:47,309
software in the class and I have had a

729
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:51,150
team do a 30-minute sprint and at the

730
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:53,180
end of that sprint they've set up source

731
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:56,849
control they've set up a continuous

732
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,349
delivery automated build they've got

733
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:59,849
that automated build feed into a

734
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,640
deployment pipeline and they've got the

735
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:06,059
deployment pipeline deploy the

736
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,819
application out to a production place

737
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,690
where anybody can access it and and they

738
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:14,130
did that in 30 minutes as well as

739
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:17,430
creating product and that was a team of

740
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:20,309
five think what that team could do in

741
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:21,840
two weeks if they could do that in 30

742
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:25,090
minutes

743
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,460
so being able to get as early feedback

744
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:31,060
from customers as possible and and

745
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:33,550
measure the value rather than activity

746
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,130
so don't measure how long people spend

747
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,020
per day doing the particular tasks it is

748
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:42,100
completely meaningless it's about the

749
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:44,080
value that you get for your users a good

750
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,730
example of that is that same team that

751
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,859
I've been talking about and this is

752
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,140
features delivered per year with the

753
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:53,200
azure DevOps team which was the TFS team

754
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,230
at Microsoft and in 2012 they were

755
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,970
delivering 22 features to production

756
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:02,740
each year they spent a lot of time

757
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:05,560
reorganizing themselves paying back 10

758
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,300
technical debt moving to a three-week

759
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,859
cadence for the dalish to production

760
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:13,420
every three weeks and over the next

761
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,869
what's that in the in the graph six

762
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:21,190
years there they're still going in that

763
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:23,770
model bits from 2012 to 2017 they ended

764
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:27,460
up moving from 22 features to production

765
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:30,880
each year to 260 plus features to

766
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:35,230
production each year most of that paying

767
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,670
back technical debt lack increase

768
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,950
collaboration so we remove that 50% and

769
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:45,010
spend time working on the right features

770
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:47,950
rather than the wrong features you can

771
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:50,050
get these optimizations as well if

772
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,970
you're willing to change your

773
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:57,100
organization change the way you do

774
00:38:51,970 --> 00:39:00,100
things in order to get there so what

775
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,010
about the the who the culture in the

776
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,890
organization we need to change a lot of

777
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:09,040
other things to make it work and really

778
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:12,070
it's that flipping it on its head that

779
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,570
you you you hear about a lot rather than

780
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,300
customers being at the bottom and the

781
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:19,000
CEO being at the top and you customers

782
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:23,260
are around the outside and you have

783
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,010
delivery teams delivering value to those

784
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:30,609
customers on a continuous basis and with

785
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:33,250
CEO online of business leaders setting

786
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:35,559
strategic direction at that level as the

787
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:39,180
modern digital organization

788
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:41,499
is based around that idea of we have a

789
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,180
cross-functional delivery teams across

790
00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:47,410
our organization continuously delivering

791
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:53,529
value to our users and we're getting

792
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:57,819
feedback and adapting that idea one

793
00:39:53,529 --> 00:40:00,309
thing to note is that is that culture

794
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:03,369
eats your strategy for breakfast

795
00:40:00,309 --> 00:40:07,029
whatever whatever that strategy is it is

796
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:11,109
your people and that will both make it

797
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:13,569
happen and get in the way of making it

798
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:16,689
happen so we have to bring bring them

799
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:19,959
along we have to make sure that we cater

800
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:23,430
for the needs of people they are not

801
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:27,579
resources that's traditional terroristic

802
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:29,439
thinking where most modern management

803
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,680
practices were designed around managing

804
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:34,599
factory workers Industrial Revolution

805
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:39,880
and factory workers is a whole different

806
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:42,039
ballgame from knowledge workers so

807
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,529
there's a really good book by a

808
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:47,769
gentleman called Dan pink called drive

809
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:49,119
and it's about moving away from the

810
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:52,079
carrot and the stick

811
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,239
towards something a little bit more

812
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,539
modern so carrot and the stick really

813
00:40:55,239 --> 00:41:01,420
only talks about extrinsic motivations

814
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:03,910
motivations from the outside so if you

815
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,369
as an individual do not have enough

816
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,880
money to feed your family you're

817
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:12,039
struggling to feed your family put a

818
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,890
roof over your head the only thing that

819
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:17,729
matters to you is solving those problems

820
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:21,670
and that's going to be more money

821
00:41:17,729 --> 00:41:24,009
however once and I hope all of your

822
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:27,339
knowledge workers are in this category

823
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:32,109
and once you're not struggling to put

824
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:34,749
food on the table motivation changes to

825
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:36,729
intrinsic motivations and those

826
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:42,059
intrinsic motivations are autonomy

827
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:45,009
mastery and purpose and autonomy is

828
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,750
being in charge of your own destiny you

829
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:50,080
decide

830
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:53,530
what you work on when and how mastery is

831
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,420
about being good at what you do most

832
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:58,300
people in knowledge working space want

833
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:02,460
to learn more do more be more capable

834
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:05,830
and better over time and have a purpose

835
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:09,490
so they want to feel like the things

836
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:12,550
that they do actually matter but we have

837
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:15,910
to have a balance there and you got a

838
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:18,970
balance autonomy an alignment if you

839
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:22,930
have too much alignment you're going to

840
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:24,640
stifle the innovation of these smart

841
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,030
people that you've hired to go do the

842
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,400
work

843
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,330
if you have too much bureaucracy in your

844
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:32,560
organization then they can't go solve

845
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:35,130
problems and interesting and innovative

846
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,960
ways that will get you to market quicker

847
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:40,660
but if we have too much autonomy then

848
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,610
you end up with a bunch of people going

849
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,380
in different directions so you need to

850
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,200
find that balance inside your

851
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,630
organization you need to figure out

852
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,990
maybe where you are right now where you

853
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,150
would like to be take one step in the

854
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:58,330
direction you would like to go see where

855
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:00,190
you get to and inspect and adapt those

856
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:03,840
changes to your organization as well

857
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:06,660
make a change see if it worked

858
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,370
getting those changes in front of people

859
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:13,210
they don't have to be perfect you just

860
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:15,840
have to try stuff see if it works and we

861
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:20,310
need to try and shift shift the needle

862
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:24,220
from management over to leadership

863
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:26,650
rather than talking about deadlines and

864
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:30,310
timelines and project plans we should be

865
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:32,590
talking about a flow of value getting to

866
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:35,500
our customers because the deadlines

867
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:38,680
don't really matter you might have

868
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,750
deadlines that do matter you might be in

869
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,060
a regulated industry you might have to

870
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,700
meet legal requirements those are

871
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:48,100
constraints that are out with the bounds

872
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,080
of this conversation I can't help you

873
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:52,240
fix those they were just things that

874
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,570
happen you might have FDA regulations

875
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,010
you might have whatever but within the

876
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,190
bounds of your organizational

877
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:00,810
constraints how far can you go towards

878
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,470
folks

879
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:06,600
on product owners on floor and on value

880
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:10,140
how far can you go you want to get as

881
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:14,160
close to that as you can and instead of

882
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,380
having providing people with answers

883
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,910
again a tailor istic management practice

884
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,420
because people don't need to think if

885
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:24,870
they're doing monotonous factory work we

886
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,460
want to enable our self-organization

887
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:28,890
with our scrum teams so they get that

888
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:32,370
autonomy they feel like they're in

889
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:34,800
charge of their own destiny so these are

890
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:38,340
some changes that we want to move away

891
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,580
from towards those from management

892
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:46,080
towards leadership and in order to do

893
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:48,570
that it's important to establish Scott

894
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:53,670
strong scrum mastery inside your

895
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:55,050
organization there is I feel that

896
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,900
there's a very tight relationship

897
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,630
between a scrum master and a leader

898
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,880
inside your organization they have some

899
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,920
of the same roles and accountabilities

900
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,930
they're just maybe operating at

901
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:12,990
different levels inside the organization

902
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:16,080
so a scrum master can the role of scrum

903
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:18,270
master again it's not the up title the

904
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,310
role of scrum master can operate at any

905
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:26,490
level they can be a change agent for

906
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:29,610
your organization they can be a coach to

907
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:33,800
individuals and they it can be a new

908
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:38,850
management role but it should never be a

909
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,950
servant or moderator for teams that's

910
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:44,370
not the role of the scrum master you're

911
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:48,559
hiring smart clever resourceful people

912
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:51,739
take advantage of that

913
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:55,309
that's this that's really where you want

914
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:59,359
to get to in order to achieve that scrum

915
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:01,849
masters Cana and we talk about in the

916
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,650
agile community this is from the agile

917
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:05,449
coaching competency framework that they

918
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:09,709
had your floating Institute and the many

919
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:12,019
stances of a scrum master and so if

920
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:15,920
you're a lean agile practitioner you

921
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:18,650
understand the foundations of agile you

922
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,009
understand the foundations of lean and

923
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,749
you figure out how best to use some of

924
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:27,699
those techniques in your organization

925
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:30,289
and you're going to need certain skills

926
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:31,519
depending on which level you're focusing

927
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:33,439
at depending on the size your

928
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:35,719
organization as well may be constrained

929
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:39,799
but you need some level of technical

930
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:43,579
mastery so that you can help teams be

931
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:45,259
able to do do this thing this DevOps

932
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:49,339
thing do a continuous delivery do

933
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:51,229
feature flags hiders how do those things

934
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:54,170
work and how do we encourage our teams

935
00:46:51,229 --> 00:46:56,239
towards those models how do we encourage

936
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,069
them towards doing TDD and having code

937
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,459
reviews and doing all the things they

938
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:05,059
need to do we need your masters need

939
00:47:01,459 --> 00:47:07,219
some level of business mastery how are

940
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:10,369
they possibly going to be able to help

941
00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:13,249
the the product to owner become a better

942
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:16,150
product owner if they don't have some

943
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:19,219
level of business mastery so you'll find

944
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,299
that many agile leaders have that

945
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:24,829
business mastery already what about

946
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:26,929
organizational transformational mastery

947
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:28,939
if we're going to make changes to our

948
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:32,900
organization we're gonna try and get

949
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:35,359
better at delivering remove bureaucracy

950
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,420
in order to actually get things done and

951
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,329
how do we do that how do we make those

952
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,650
changes at the organizational level

953
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:44,900
these are these are all important

954
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,819
questions there's no right answers I

955
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,729
would recommend looking at the agile

956
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:51,650
coaching Institute's classes and courses

957
00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:54,529
and seeing what you can do there you can

958
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:57,079
also take the professional scrum master

959
00:47:54,529 --> 00:48:01,560
class where we talk about and introduce

960
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:04,260
some of these things or the advanced

961
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,050
master class from scrambler dark where

962
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:12,500
we talk about liberating structures and

963
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:16,520
how we can organize people around

964
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,050
getting the best most is the wrong word

965
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:23,330
getting getting the most effective

966
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:26,490
outcomes from groups of people

967
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:29,420
facilitating that a much higher level

968
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:35,100
and it's a very powerful powerful class

969
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:38,670
so professionalism the how what are we

970
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:43,220
going to talk about here so um there's

971
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:45,630
an interesting misunderstanding that and

972
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,390
everybody on a scrum team has to be

973
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:51,710
cross-functional that's where this well

974
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:55,800
this is where I believe this magic

975
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:59,750
unicorn of the full stack developer that

976
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:03,450
came from and these people that are

977
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:06,210
cross cross functional but they seem to

978
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:08,370
be a suicide me knife they are actually

979
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:10,110
very rare many people will say they're a

980
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:12,870
full stack developer and they're they're

981
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:16,920
not they're actually just a generalist

982
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:21,060
they might have deep specialism in one

983
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:24,540
two maybe three areas but they're a

984
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:27,690
generalist my background and expertise I

985
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:30,840
was a software developer for ten years

986
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:33,480
then I moved into the DevOps space with

987
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:36,630
TFS and as your DevOps and I helped

988
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:40,110
customers optimize their their processes

989
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:43,230
for many years and I moved very quickly

990
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:45,200
towards that process agile scrum lean

991
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:49,260
Kanban all of those things as well

992
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:54,090
that's my expertise my expertise is not

993
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:58,220
in testing however I have taught testis

994
00:49:54,090 --> 00:50:02,580
I have a general enough knowledge in

995
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:05,610
testing on what tests mastery should

996
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,550
look like in order to go help and coach

997
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:11,130
a group of people around getting better

998
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:13,830
at testing they are going to be the

999
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,060
experts I'm definitely not going to be

1000
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:18,090
an expert in that

1001
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:20,190
but I can help them move towards getting

1002
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:23,670
them also fit so I can be a generalist I

1003
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:28,200
can do testing I just am NOT an expert I

1004
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:31,200
can do DevOps I am an expert I can do

1005
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,570
documentation writing oh maybe I'm okay

1006
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,660
at document writing we all have lots of

1007
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:37,830
different skills if you look at a

1008
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,560
Harvard Business Review article from

1009
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:43,800
1986 called the new new product

1010
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:48,030
development game it talks about all of

1011
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:51,420
the research that was done to figure out

1012
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:55,830
that a team of generalists will almost

1013
00:50:51,420 --> 00:51:00,540
always outperform individual specialists

1014
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:03,750
because that now my dear that somebody

1015
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,910
smart comes up with yes debunked by

1016
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,160
somebody else you have somebody to

1017
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:10,590
bounce your ideas off you know that

1018
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,300
thing where you have a problem you can't

1019
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,280
figure it out you go talk to somebody

1020
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,610
who maybe has no idea what your problem

1021
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,800
is but in talking it through you figure

1022
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:21,210
it out they helped you figure it out if

1023
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,120
you have a bunch of smart people

1024
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,980
together you can surf ideas you can

1025
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,200
figure out the nuances of those things

1026
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,050
bring those different backgrounds

1027
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:35,520
together Microsoft I think has done

1028
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:39,600
white paper on how much diversity is

1029
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:43,470
important and the outcome that I

1030
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:47,430
understand is that the more diverse a

1031
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:51,710
team the better and that was race

1032
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,710
religion culture

1033
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,710
background everything technology the

1034
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:04,180
more diverse the people in a team the

1035
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:11,130
more are the better the outcomes that

1036
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:14,170
the team has so in that vein the old way

1037
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:16,690
was that and again this is the tailor

1038
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,760
istic practice from factory workers

1039
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,740
we're gonna have a management team we're

1040
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,320
gonna have a development team and we're

1041
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,940
going to have test team and we're gonna

1042
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:29,410
make sure that they don't talk to each

1043
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:31,510
other and that the the you know just

1044
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:33,400
send bugs back and forth or instructions

1045
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:35,230
that really doesn't work

1046
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,360
so these your DevOps team at Microsoft

1047
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:39,340
move very quickly at the start they made

1048
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,040
a lot of mistakes in this process don't

1049
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,420
get me wrong but they got a lot of

1050
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,150
learnings as well because by making

1051
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,840
mistakes we learn things and they move

1052
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:52,900
to a single engineering in fact they

1053
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:56,770
also pulled in other roles as well like

1054
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:59,500
service delivery UX UE all of those

1055
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:03,340
things coming into at one place and then

1056
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:07,780
they created teams our own server or I

1057
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:11,530
have delivery teams around people from

1058
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,870
engineering paired with somebody from

1059
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:18,580
program management so that you get that

1060
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:21,640
holistic strategic direction plus smart

1061
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:26,350
ideas for for doing and delivering on

1062
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:29,410
the work so bring them together but you

1063
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:36,940
still when you move away from that idea

1064
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:42,250
of having M core I'm just looking at

1065
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:44,440
test and you move towards having a

1066
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,260
cross-functional team and you maybe

1067
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:49,930
start to lose some of that expertise

1068
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,820
that testers can share with each other

1069
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,680
when they're sitting together in the

1070
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:57,190
same department now there are on lots of

1071
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,130
different teams so the way we tend to

1072
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:03,640
handle that is with communities of

1073
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,740
practice and it's kind of like a user

1074
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,550
group you know if you want to meet up

1075
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:08,050
you'll find it by

1076
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:11,110
user groups you can go to the Knitting

1077
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,340
user group how do you make sure that you

1078
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,920
share knowledge inside your organization

1079
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:17,740
run internal user groups on whatever

1080
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:19,530
topics make sense I would expect

1081
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:22,180
communities of practice around

1082
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:25,930
architecture in order to make sure that

1083
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:28,330
the the teams are understand why

1084
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,010
architecture is important rather than

1085
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,830
telling them how to do their

1086
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:35,040
architecture educate them on what good

1087
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:40,180
architecture looks like same for

1088
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:43,210
security same for tests same for coding

1089
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,030
that same for any of the practices that

1090
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:47,830
need to happen inside and around the

1091
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:50,530
team so they can share share that

1092
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:53,860
knowledge so for this particular team at

1093
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:56,650
Microsoft you might be asking well what

1094
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,660
changed with just the things that I

1095
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:01,380
talked about things that changed or did

1096
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:06,060
more things change well really

1097
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:10,570
everything changed for this team they

1098
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:13,660
moved from delivering software they were

1099
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:17,260
actually on a two-year cadence with a

1100
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:19,690
service pack halfway for many many years

1101
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:22,030
and that built up a lot of technical

1102
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,340
debt because you generally didn't go

1103
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,290
back and change the same thing over and

1104
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,210
over again on an iterative basis as you

1105
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:34,120
learned more from the customer it was

1106
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:38,350
more fire-and-forget and lots of bugs I

1107
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:41,640
think at one point they had tens of

1108
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:45,490
thousands of reported bugs in the system

1109
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:47,020
and it got too much they were struggling

1110
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:50,320
under the same complexities that

1111
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:53,500
everybody else struggles under even

1112
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,540
though their main business seems like

1113
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,460
its building software Microsoft's main

1114
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,260
business is not building software they

1115
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,770
do what everybody else does they build

1116
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:05,440
software to support their main business

1117
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:11,020
productivity tools whatever whatever

1118
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:13,860
that that is so in order to move forward

1119
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:17,260
you need to create professional teams

1120
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:19,810
they need to be empowered delivery teams

1121
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,410
that are able to take ideas that people

1122
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,859
have

1123
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:26,799
turn them interval into increments of

1124
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:28,990
usable software things that people can

1125
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:32,279
actually use shorten those feedback

1126
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:34,450
loops and reduce the technical debt

1127
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:37,170
maintain communities of practice and

1128
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:39,970
measure the outcomes don't just assume

1129
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:42,190
that the features you build are going to

1130
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:44,140
be useful to your customers make sure

1131
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:47,589
they're going to be useful to your

1132
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:51,460
customers so if I was to have some

1133
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:54,700
takeaways have product owners with clear

1134
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:58,029
ownership that maximize value to your

1135
00:56:54,700 --> 00:57:01,210
customers and create professional teams

1136
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:06,009
that embody technical excellence and I

1137
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:09,309
can't stress at technical excellence

1138
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:12,390
more and is really really important and

1139
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:15,009
have strong scrum masters that are

1140
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:19,089
empowered to be organizational change

1141
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:23,700
agents that are not going to accept the

1142
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:23,700
status quo that are always going to be

1143
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,039
pushing on those things that maybe we

1144
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:32,980
can't change right now but we should be

1145
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:35,529
changing in the future how do we bring

1146
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:43,630
HR into that story how do we how do we

1147
00:57:35,529 --> 00:57:46,630
do that so I talked about three well

1148
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:48,609
really four areas I I described the

1149
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,940
problem that we have where we're losing

1150
00:57:48,609 --> 00:57:54,579
a lot of time where we're losing a lot

1151
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:58,000
of resource where we lose hemorrhaging

1152
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,349
money all over the place in engineering

1153
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,599
and software development at the moment

1154
00:57:59,349 --> 00:58:04,210
and we talked about where those problems

1155
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,789
are coming from at the who the what and

1156
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:09,220
the how and I'm in each of those areas

1157
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:13,329
we talked about some of the things you

1158
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:16,299
can do to try and reduce the level of

1159
00:58:13,329 --> 00:58:19,210
waste in those areas and improve the

1160
00:58:16,299 --> 00:58:22,029
situation even small improvements even

1161
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:24,849
if you made a 1% improvement think of

1162
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:29,250
the budget in your organization and what

1163
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:33,550
does 1% mean to your business even 1%

1164
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:35,620
can be important so don't think about

1165
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:38,260
I need to change everything think about

1166
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:41,830
what's the first thing that you need to

1167
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:45,130
do to try and improve things do that see

1168
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:51,750
how you get on okay so let me see if

1169
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:51,750
