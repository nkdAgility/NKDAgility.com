What is Scrum? Scrum is a social technology that allows groups of people to organise around a common purpose. 

It's specifically designed to work in complex space, and that may be a bit of a weird term. So complex is when you know less at the beginning than you understand while doing it, right? 

So usually the things that you do are unrepeatable. You're doing different things all the time, stuff you've never done before. Whenever there's a huge variation in how long you think it's going to take and how long it actually takes, that's complex. 

And Scrum is specifically designed to operate in that space, or at least the edges of that space.
