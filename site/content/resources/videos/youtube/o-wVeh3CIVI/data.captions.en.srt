1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
what what is Scrum scrum is a social

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,440
technology

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,019
that allows groups of people to organize

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,400
around a common purpose

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,220
it's specifically designed to work in

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,300
complex space and that may be a bit of a

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,880
weird term so complex is when you know

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,359
less at the beginning then you

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,980
understand while doing it right so

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,020
usually the things that you do are

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,579
unrepeatable

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,280
um you're doing different things all the

13
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,540
time stuff you've never done before

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
whenever there's a there's a huge

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,719
variation in how long you think it's

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
going to take and how long it actually

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,340
takes that's complex and scrum is

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,260
specifically designed to operate in that

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,620
in that space or at least the edges of

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,620
that space
