**What is Scrum?**

Interpreting Scrum

Many people know that Scrum is related to organising around a common purpose, a sort of social technology for shared goals.

But have you ever gone deeper into the mechanics of "What is Scrum?"

Well, let me break it down for you. 🧐

Scrum is a social technology, a guiding principle that enables groups to organise around a shared purpose. 🎯  I like to describe it quite simply as a social technology that facilitates groups of people to rally around a common goal. 💡

Navigating the Complex with Scrum

Scrum finds its groove amidst complexity. But you might be wondering, what does 'complex' really mean? In Scrum terms, it's situations where you know less at the start than you discover while you're in the thick of things. 🕵️

Now, when I say 'complex', I'm referring to situations where our initial knowledge is far less than what we gain while navigating the tasks.

Typically, complexity arises when our tasks are novel, unrepeatable, or present us with constant variations. The wide disparity between our initial assumptions about a task and its actual outcome. That's what I mean by 'complex'. 😮

And that's where Scrum shines!

It is intentionally and cleverly crafted to operate within this realm of complexity and even at its edges. 🚀

So, there you have it - Scrum in a nutshell! It's a tool for navigating the labyrinth of complex tasks, enabling us to organise and find a way forward. 💡
