1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,839
if you want to

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,279
ensure that your your your products I I

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,800
actually don't like the phrase stay

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,960
within budget I know everybody uses it

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,400
but I I don't think that way anymore

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,160
when I'm investing in things I think

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,480
about it as I I have a I have a pull of

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
money and I'm going to move that pool of

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,199
money around where it's going to provide

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,720
the most value right so I need to be

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,000
looking at I need to I need data right I

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,079
need to understand what's going on so

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
for example I talk a lot about

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,680
hypothesis driven engineering practices

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,160
if we're building brand new products or

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,360
even adding capabilities to existing

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,840
products I want to have a hypothesis

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,000
driven story and that means that we're

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,039
going to have a you know it starts with

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,920
an idea what do we what do we think we

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,039
would like to add to our product and

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,000
this could be applied to a thing on your

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,480
backlog this could be applied to the

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
whole product or it could be applied to

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:09,240
a portfolio of products right but what

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,560
do you think you're trying to do right

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,960
and then you would do some kind of

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,360
analysis of that and figure out well

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,040
what's the outcome I'm trying to achieve

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,040
right this is what I want at the outcome

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,560
this is the thing that I'm going to do

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,040
that I think will help us move towards

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,920
this outcome what's the smallest

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,240
experiment that I can run and then I

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,520
would look at how am I going going to

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,280
measure whether I've made progress

37
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,960
towards towards that goal and I'm going

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,000
to regular reg regularly regularly

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,960
regularly assess based on my progress

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,360
towards that on whether I continue to

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,240
invest in this thing or I don't and this

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,799
can be at the small scale or it can be

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,200
at the the the grandio scale any scale

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,479
you like so a a good example is the

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,799
Azure devops team at Microsoft

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,560
wanted they were they were interested at

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,360
one point in trying to answer a

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,160
particular question right so the the the

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,720
the head of the product Microsoft called

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,640
it the product unit manager I think

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,080
that's their like the technical

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,800
technical term has has overall budgetary

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,360
control right so they have they have all

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,040
the money they know that that means

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,480
people right so they have I have exactly

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,560
600 people it's not but exactly 600

57
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,959
people and I need to allocate those

58
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,200
people to the

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,080
ideas that make sense in order to

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,760
maximize my return on investment and

61
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,319
keep my stakeholders happy keep my

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,000
customers happy keep keep build products

63
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,959
and have an eye to the Future on on

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
ideation and what is it that's coming

65
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,560
coming next so they're they're

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,159
allocating people's time is the the

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,000
biggest expense right

68
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,400
so they they had this this idea was

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,959
brought to them that we'd like to help

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,640
this is this this is the idea we'd like

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,640
to help

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,920
customers discover and deal with their

73
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,360
technical

74
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,920
debt right all they're building software

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,680
that helps build software so we're all

76
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,840
building software and we have technical

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,280
debt so we it would be great if we could

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,599
understand what technical debt we have

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,480
and then have things we can do to help

80
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,120
us things that help us minimize that

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,439
technical debt so that that's that's

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,400
that's it's a grandiose idea it's a big

83
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,519
idea that goes across the entire product

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,159
Suite you know I'm going to allocate a

85
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,879
bunch of time so the idea is that I as

86
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
the product owner the Uber product owner

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
there's lots of people in charge of

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,360
different parts of the product but Uber

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,400
product owner product unit manager

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,720
decide we're going to we're going to try

91
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,959
this thing I'd like to see some

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,560
experiments within the context of this

93
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:04,200
story and

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,480
you guys figure out you folks figure out

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,480
what it is you're going to do so his his

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,439
his lieutenants who run the different

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
parts of the product come up with ideas

98
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,079
on how and collaborate together what are

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,320
we going to do what are the ideas we

100
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,720
think we can have they nle on it and

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,079
they come up with some ideas and they

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,359
bring that say this is this is what

103
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,400
we're thinking this is what we want to

104
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,600
try okay cool let's try this one this

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,759
looks pretty good and they try it and

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,400
this could involve a 100 people spending

107
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,840
some amount of time

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,560
within a within a within a a quarter

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,520
within a year within a within a fixed

110
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,440
time scale to try and create some

111
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,639
features within this context right so so

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,840
when we're spending time on this

113
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,639
experiment that's that's money's not

114
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,960
being spent on other things that we know

115
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,320
are valuable we're

116
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,160
speculating on something that we think

117
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
might be valuable in the future right

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,759
that we might be able to do something

119
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,720
with so they spent a bunch of time on it

120
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,320
I think they spent about six months four

121
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,919
to six months on it if I'm remembering

122
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,960
rightly and they come

123
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:11,000
back and they're like we we we don't

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,120
understand how to solve this

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,080
problem the things that they'd created

126
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,960
they'd managed to create some things

127
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,919
they'd got them in front of real

128
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,319
customers like myself I'm their customer

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,160
got them in front of real

130
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:29,880
customers and they just didn't resonate

131
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,759
they just didn't provide value they

132
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,880
tried a whole bunch of different ideas

133
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
there was five or six different teams

134
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,720
different groups involved in it they all

135
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,360
had different ideas they all

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,680
collaborated together to create some of

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,360
these ideas and nothing resonated with

138
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,080
the

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,080
customers so at some point the product

140
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,199
unit manager is like right let's let's

141
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,319
let's let's not invest any more money in

142
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,120
this because we we we're not we've not

143
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:01,080
got an idea that's good enough to to

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,280
move the needle or solve this problem

145
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,880
you could

146
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:09,120
say that that amount of money maybe they

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,160
invested 10 million in this capability

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,720
was wasted money you could say it was

149
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,639
wasted money but you could also say that

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,120
there was a lot of learning involved

151
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,599
they learned not to go tackle that

152
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,360
problem they learned to save their money

153
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,440
and spend it on something else so in the

154
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,280
traditional World they would have spent

155
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,199
years on that capability to find out

156
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,520
that it was a bad idea right think of

157
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,479
the windows V Windows XP no not Windows

158
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,720
XP Windows 8 tobacco sorry my brain died

159
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,280
there the Windows 8 tobacco where

160
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,759
Microsoft spent six years they have 4

161
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,280
and a half thousand software Engineers

162
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
working on Windows they have 15,000

163
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,840
other people that's involved in that

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,639
story so you're talking nearly 20,000

165
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:00,039
people working for six years imagine the

166
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,120
cost in your budget for for

167
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:06,120
20,000 people working for six years on a

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,479
product and the end outcome did not meet

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,720
the expectations of the customer did not

170
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,080
meet the the the brand value right and

171
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
in fact detracted from the brand value

172
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,039
detracted from the customer experience

173
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
and you had a lot of unhappy customers

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,280
that went to other products like apple

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
right um that was a big jump ship moment

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,800
that people moved to to to other

177
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,280
platforms and

178
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,639
this fundament mentally was the Catalyst

179
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,240
for Microsoft looking at themselves and

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,919
kind of going yeah we're doing this

181
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:45,800
wrong this long cycle long budgetary

182
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,319
fiveyear plan right and and not getting

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,879
things very quickly in front of

184
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,680
customers very quickly testing and

185
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,919
