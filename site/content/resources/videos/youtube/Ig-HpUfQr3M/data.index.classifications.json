The audience is likely technical product leaders and practitioners who could benefit from ethos-based guidance, and the signal is reasonably strong. However, the depth and intent are limited to methodology advocacy, not a discussion of ethos as a distinct foundation. Thus, the alignment and depth are somewhat moderate, with the audience and signal scores higher, but overall confidence is moderate.",
