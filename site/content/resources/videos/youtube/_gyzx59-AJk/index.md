In today’s fast-paced market, the ability to respond swiftly to changes is not just an advantage; it’s a necessity. As organisations, we often find ourselves navigating a landscape filled with surprises—some of which can be detrimental, while others present golden opportunities. The key to capitalising on these opportunities lies in our [lead time]({{< ref "/tags/lead-time" >}}). If there’s a significant delay between the moment we decide to act and when our changes hit production, we risk losing out to competitors who are quicker on the draw.

Let me share a story from my experience with the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) team. Back in the days when it was still known as TFS, they operated on a two-year release cycle. Yes, you heard that right—two years! They would ship a service pack halfway through, but the real challenge emerged when they began to gather feedback on their beta releases. Customers would provide valuable insights, highlighting missing features or changes in market demands. However, with only six months left in their development cycle, they were often left with no option but to defer these requests to the next version—or worse, the version after that. This meant that significant customer needs could go unmet for over two years, which is simply unacceptable in a rapidly evolving market.

Fast forward to 2018, and the [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) team had transformed their [deployment frequency]({{< ref "/tags/deployment-frequency" >}}) from a mere 20-30 deployments a year to an astonishing 880,000! This dramatic shift illustrates the power of shortening feedback loops. By continuously delivering updates and features to production, they could test ideas in real-time, gather data, and adapt accordingly.

Here are some key takeaways from this transformation that I believe can benefit any organisation looking to enhance their agility:

- **Embrace [Continuous Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}})**: Instead of adhering to rigid release schedules, aim for continuous delivery. This allows you to push features to users as soon as they’re ready, enabling you to gather feedback and iterate quickly.

- **Start Small**: When exploring new market opportunities, focus on the smallest viable feature that can validate your idea. This approach minimises risk and allows for rapid testing and learning.

- **Utilise Data and Telemetry**: Once your feature is live, leverage data to assess its performance. This will inform your next steps—whether to invest further in the idea, pivot, or scrap it altogether.

- **Stay Ahead of the Curve**: By maintaining a tight release frequency, you position your organisation to not just react to market changes but to anticipate and set trends. This proactive stance can differentiate you from competitors who are merely following the market.

- **Maximise Value Creation**: Ultimately, the goal is to maximise the value you create for your users. By being responsive and adaptable, you can ensure that your product remains relevant and valuable in a constantly changing environment.

In conclusion, the journey from a lengthy release cycle to continuous delivery is not just about adopting new tools or processes; it’s about fostering a culture of agility and responsiveness. By prioritising quick feedback loops and [continuous improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}}), we can not only survive but thrive in today’s competitive landscape. Let’s not just keep pace with the market—let’s lead it.
