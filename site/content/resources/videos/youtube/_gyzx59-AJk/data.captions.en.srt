1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,000
if you're an

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,599
organization and you're trying to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,160
respond to changes that happen in the

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,000
market you want to be able to respond to

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,920
them as quickly as possible so those

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,600
changes could be surprises surprises are

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
usually bad um that you have to go deal

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,519
with or it could be opportunities right

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,279
things you want to go take advantage

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:31,519
of and if you have a long lead time

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,280
between

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,000
deciding you want to do something and it

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,600
ending up in production then you're not

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,160
going to be able to take advantage of

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,879
opportunities that arise lots of

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,480
opportunities are going to float by and

17
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,960
somebody else is going to take advantage

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,480
of them or you're not going to be first

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,719
to Market or any of those things so one

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,520
of

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,879
the I'm going to use an example so the

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,479
aure devops team when was TFS back in

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:08,159
201 uh 10 2012 type of time frame they

24
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,040
were they were doing a 2-yearly ship

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,640
schedule right so they were shipping to

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,600
production every two years that was

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,439
their Cadence with a service pack

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,000
halfway what would invariably

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,280
happen is they would get halfway through

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
their development their two years so

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,320
after a year or maybe a year and a half

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,640
they would they would ship a a beta of

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,000
the new version of the product and

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,560
people would start kicking the tires on

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,680
the beta and they would have lots of

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
feedback and some of that feedback could

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,159
be incorporated but maybe the feedback

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,119
was a a bigger missing feature or

39
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,040
something that customers are doing in

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,479
the market that that isn't in the

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,040
product or some change in the way we do

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,880
things that's a bigger change something

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,119
a little bit meteor right and there's

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
there's no way we can we can fit that

45
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,159
into this version of the product right

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,079
so there's there's six months left to go

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,320
we're we're effectively mostly bug

48
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,759
fixing and tweaking from our 2-year

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,879
development they coming to the end of

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,319
our two-year

51
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,160
development and we've already planned

52
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,879
the work that's going to go

53
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,800
into the next version of the

54
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,760
product so in actual fact unless this

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,599
feature is super important it might be

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,560
just a little problem for

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,120
customers we're not going to bump

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,360
anything out of the next version of the

59
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,200
to fit this in so those

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,040
features aren't going to make it into

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,519
the product for more than two years

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,879
because it'll be not the next version

63
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,360
but the next next version of the

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,560
product and that was a huge conundrum

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,800
for them because devops was starting to

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,640
move

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,400
faster Azure was taking off and

68
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,159
customers wanted these faster Cycles

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,720
faster deployments and visual studio and

70
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,760
TFS and those kind of tools weren't able

71
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,799
to keep up at all windows as well but

72
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,319
that was a little bit later not much

73
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:11,599
later but a little bit later

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,200
so they need they needed to shorten that

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,040
delivery time right they had to have

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,959
high deployment frequencies rather than

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,720
low deployment frequencies and they

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,040
literally went from from in 2010

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,360
Microsoft was doing something like 20 or

80
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,720
30 deployments a year right so the the

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,680
the the the deployments of their

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,040
products and and by the end of 2018 I

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,239
think they were at 880,000

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,200
deployments per year across the

85
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,040
organization and that's just in aure

86
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,959
devops not for aure devops but in the

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,280
product aure devops that they used for

88
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,560
for that so when you shorten your

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,439
feedback

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,560
loop between getting an idea out there

91
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,400
getting something in the market testing

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,480
it in the market getting that feedback

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,000
look back around how quickly can you

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,439
adapt right time to learn is going

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
around that effectively going around

96
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,680
that Loop twice so in order to do that

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,079
you don't want a yearly deployment you

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,159
don't want a six-monthly deployment you

99
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,840
don't want you don't even want a two-

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,959
weekly deployment you want continuous

101
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,520
delivery to production you want to

102
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,160
continuously be able to get the features

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,199
that you're working on that your teams

104
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,280
are working on in front of real users as

105
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,160
quickly as possible you want to take an

106
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,199
idea that you have and you want to take

107
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,960
like what what's the smallest test we

108
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,720
can do what's the smallest feature we

109
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,560
can build smallest thing we can build in

110
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,479
our product to validate whether this

111
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,160
this Market opportunity actually

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,800
exists right and and get that into your

113
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,560
product as quickly as possible then look

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,280
at the data look at the Telemetry and

115
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
decide whether you're going to invest

116
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,320
more in that or it needs to be changed

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
slightly or

118
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,400
yeah it was a great idea in my head but

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,800
once we started engaging with users it

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,520
wasn't a good idea and in order to be

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,479
able to do that in order to be able to

122
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,120
move with Market changes meet Market

123
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:24,080
demands and look forward into the future

124
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,600
to preempt and try to get ahead of the

125
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,560
market right you want to be the one

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,080
setting the market you don't want to be

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,000
following your competitors you want to

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,560
be the one setting the market trends and

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,440
in order to do that you have to be on a

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,160
tight release frequency you have to be

131
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,639
continuously delivering your product to

132
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,400
to to production you have to be getting

133
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:49,000
every change you make in front of real

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,120
users and that is going to help you um

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,039
adapt to Market opportunities deal with

136
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,039
Market surprises and maximize the value

137
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,039
that you create in your product
