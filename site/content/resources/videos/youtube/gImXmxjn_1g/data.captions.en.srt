1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,500
so what are three top tips

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,500
for a new agile consultant

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,279
um

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,680
so I think

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,660
the first the first thing is understand

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,880
the domain

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,460
within which you're working

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,439
if you're going to be Consulting on a

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,439
particular topic

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,360
um like for example going into an

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,460
organization that builds some kind of

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
software product

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:40,020
and helping them get

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,260
shorten the feedback loop and get better

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,660
at delivering that product then

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,100
you want to understand what it takes to

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,000
build products

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,059
you want to have a keen understanding of

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,100
the context within which the teams the

20
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,840
people that are doing the work are

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,579
operating because it's the people that

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,699
are doing the work that are actually

23
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,040
moving the business forward

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,320
um they're directed by directed that's

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,780
probably two stronger words

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,439
um well it might be depending on your

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,360
level of control but they're directed by

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,180
above like what direction are we going

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,740
what's our goals what's our objectives

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,360
but

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,960
um they need to

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,460
um be intrinsically understanding of

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,680
that that context that's the first one

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,600
is understand the context of the people

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,560
that are doing the work

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,240
um

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,240
what would be a second thing

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,439
listen

39
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,680
probably a very powerful skill

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,860
is is is listening to what the people

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,600
that are doing the work are saying

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:54,840
and how that what differs or relates to

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,380
what leadership sing and what customers

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,020
are saying I often do

45
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,119
um interviews across all levels of the

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,759
organization when I start working with a

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,619
team or with a with a company to really

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,200
get an understanding of of what it is

49
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,720
that's going on and and it's incredible

50
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,340
the different stories that are told from

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,860
the same perspective from people at

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,280
those different levels I remember an

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,620
organization where the the the

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,540
engineering the leadership was like yeah

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,400
we're awesome we do continuous delivery

56
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,280
we've we test everything we've got

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,780
automation we're brilliant

58
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
um and the people doing the work were

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,560
like oh my goodness me we've get no

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
automation life sucks we're doing

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,700
everything manually it's a struggle

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
every day to get out of bed and go work

63
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,000
on this big pile of crap that we're

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,400
delivering

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,860
um and and and that that fragmentation

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,680
was through a lack of transparency

67
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,840
right and even I spoke to some customers

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
for that team they managed to get a

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,160
couple of customers and they weren't

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,200
external they were internal customers to

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
the organization but they were like yeah

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,459
you know we don't tell them about every

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640
problem that we have we actually keep a

74
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,739
separate list of problems because we as

75
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,019
the customer see the engineering teams

76
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,780
as totally overloaded and running around

77
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,879
like with their hair on fire so we feed

78
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,920
them things that we think of as

79
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,900
important right they're creating a

80
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,120
separate backlog of work and

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,400
prioritizing it as the customer because

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,959
they see the struggle that the

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,519
engineering teams are under yet

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,220
leadership is like everything's awesome

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,379
and we're great right so that that that

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,180
that that

87
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,519
listening to people talking to them

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,800
finding out what's actually going on at

89
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,959
different levels because everybody's

90
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,159
story is different

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,319
um and at every level in the

92
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,720
organization and if you get that

93
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,519
difference in story you know there's a

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,159
fundamental problem with transparency

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
so that's perhaps your first Focus for

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,340
organizational change and organizational

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
shift

98
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,920
and now I've got to come up with a third

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,040
one see you need to you need to be able

100
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,220
to articulate what people don't want to

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,220
hear

102
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,939
so

103
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,700
I remember before I was able to do that

104
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,919
I went into an organization that had

105
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,380
just gone through a massive reorgan

106
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,019
restructure

107
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,960
um in order to try and Achieve agility

108
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,759
and they'd ended up with a test Silo and

109
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,040
an engineering Silo and an operation

110
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,400
Silo right same old crap

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,860
and I was sitting in with the CEO and he

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,919
turned to me and said

113
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,320
do I need to pick this apart and do

114
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,199
another big reorg

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,860
and I was afraid to say

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,320
yes what you've done is wrong

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,540
it is not going to achieve the outcome

118
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,419
that you want to achieve

119
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,880
and you're gonna need to redo it with an

120
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,100
eye to cross-functional Vertical slices

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,979
value stream right focus on those things

122
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,000
and I was afraid to say that because I

123
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:08,759
was a lowly uh wet behind the ears

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,460
devops consultant back in the day

125
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,139
um and this was sitting in with the CEO

126
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,120
of a large multinational company and I

127
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,220
felt I couldn't couldn't couldn't tell

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,080
him he was wrong

129
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,300
um I've since learned and in fact that

130
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,240
that

131
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,520
happens that that that story is one of

132
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,680
my catalysts for

133
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,360
um just saying to people when you think

134
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,759
something's wrong they can always

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,380
disagree with you they can always not

136
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,539
like you

137
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,360
um but you need to you need to say you

138
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,340
need to if something's not right and

139
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
you're a consultant you're hired because

140
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,139
you have more information

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,539
right you've got you've got more insight

142
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,220
uh you're hired for your expert opinion

143
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,139
give it

144
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,539
um even if they're not gonna like what

145
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,560
you're gonna say

146
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,560
so that was three things
