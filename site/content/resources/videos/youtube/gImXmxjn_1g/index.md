As I reflect on my journey as an agile consultant, I often find myself thinking about the essential skills that can make or break your effectiveness in this role. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your approach, here are my top three tips for new agile consultants that I believe can set you on the right path.

### 1. Understand the Domain

First and foremost, it’s crucial to grasp the domain in which you’re working. If you’re stepping into an organisation that develops software products, you need to have a solid understanding of what it takes to build those products. This isn’t just about the technical aspects; it’s about the context in which the teams operate. 

- **Know the People**: The individuals doing the work are the ones driving the business forward. They need to be intrinsically aware of their goals and objectives, and as a consultant, you should facilitate that understanding.
- **Context is Key**: Understanding the environment, challenges, and dynamics of the team will enable you to provide relevant and impactful advice. 

### 2. Listen Actively

Listening is one of the most powerful skills you can develop as a consultant. It’s not just about hearing what people say; it’s about understanding the nuances of their experiences and perspectives.

- **Conduct Interviews**: When I start working with a new team or organisation, I often conduct interviews across all levels. This helps me uncover the different stories that emerge from various perspectives.
- **Spot the Discrepancies**: I recall a situation where [leadership]({{< ref "/categories/leadership" >}}) believed they were excelling in [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}), while the team on the ground felt overwhelmed and unsupported. This disconnect highlighted a significant lack of [transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) within the organisation. 
- **Focus on Transparency**: If you notice differing narratives, it’s a clear sign that transparency is lacking. This should be your first focus when driving [organisational change]({{< ref "/tags/organisational-change" >}}).

### 3. Articulate the Uncomfortable Truths

Finally, as a consultant, you must be prepared to articulate what people may not want to hear. This can be daunting, especially when dealing with senior leadership.

- **Be Honest**: I remember a time when I hesitated to tell a CEO that their recent reorganisation was misguided. They had created silos that would ultimately hinder agility. It took me a while to realise that my role was to provide my expert opinion, even if it wasn’t what they wanted to hear.
- **Embrace Your Expertise**: Remember, you’re hired for your insights. If something feels off, don’t shy away from voicing your concerns. It’s better to be honest and potentially face disagreement than to remain silent and allow issues to fester.

### Conclusion

In summary, as you embark on your journey as an agile consultant, keep these three tips in mind: understand the domain, listen actively, and be prepared to speak the uncomfortable truth. These skills will not only enhance your effectiveness but also help you build trust and credibility within the organisations you work with.
