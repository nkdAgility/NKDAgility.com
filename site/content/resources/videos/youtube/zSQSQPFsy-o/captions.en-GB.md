So the question was, why is Scrum so easy to understand but incredibly difficult to master? And that's an interesting and recently contentious one because there seems to be a prevailing idea that if something is difficult and hard and lots of people can't do it, that it must be inherently broken. 

And to that I would say I'm not going to win a hundred meters race in the Olympics no matter how hard I try and does that mean that that sport is inherently broken? No it just means that I can't do it. I can try really hard and I could probably, with lots of practice, learn to run pretty fast without falling on my face, although that might be difficult. 

But the reality is that it's only difficult because of our inherent baggage, right? If you think about the Tayloristic practices of the past and how they impose themselves throughout the entire hierarchy of an organization, the entire structure of an organization. And we're talking about moving to something different. 

And Scrum's purpose, one of Scrum's purposes is transparency, right? It's designed so that by implementing it, it makes transparent things that make empiricism difficult in your organization. So it's gonna be hard, right? Because lots of organizations are not set up for accepting empiricism right many organizations have vanity metrics have enforced ways of working that work for one team over here somewhere but don't work for all of these other teams. 

So that idea that Scrum is easy to understand I think is also a little bit of a fallacy because it's not that easy to understand. If it was easy to understand you wouldn't have thousands of books on the Scrum Guide, right? It's not easy to understand. 

It's easy to read the words, it's fast to read the words, but understanding the theory and first principles that are embedded in there, understanding the, like, what are we at, what is the purpose for each of the events? What are we supposed to get out of it? Because almost all of the events that teams do that I go see don't fulfill the purpose described in the Chrome guide. 

A good example of that is the sprint review. The purpose of the sprint review is to figure out what's next. It's to take into account since the last sprint review, the product has changed, the business has changed, right? They might have changed their mind, they might have changed direction, the market might have changed. 

How did those things affect the transparency of the product backlog? If the product backlog is meant to be a transparent list of our current best understanding of what's next, how does what's happened in the last two weeks affect that? And very rarely do I find teams actually walking out of sprint planning with an updated product backlog, right? With that information embedded in there, they've reordered the backlog with the stakeholders. They've brought in that information. They've asked the right questions. 

What I see most teams do is they demo the product, ask for feedback. They don't get any feedback or limited feedback or that one person that shouts, and then they're done. That's not a sprint review, right? So that's why it's not easy to understand and it's not hard to do. 

Sorry. Yeah. It's not easy to understand, it's hard to do, and the outcomes that people get are so varied because of those incompatibilities between what people interpret as the thing versus the actual thing. 

And that, I think, is not it's I was going to say, that's frustrating, right? But I don't think it is. I think it's part of the fun, right? It's how do we, how do we, how, every company need, every company and every team needs to be unique. Otherwise there's no point in them being there, right? If I can just get another team to do it or another company to provide that product, why would I use your company versus that company? 

It all comes down to price, right? It shouldn't be about price. It's about value that's being delivered. How do you create an organizational structure? How do you create a team ethos, a product that is unique and distinct in the market so that you build more value and that that's that's these unique interpretations of the Scrum Guide. 

These unique practices that you add to the Scrum guide. Scrum's just a little rule book, right? It's like when you go out and buy Monopoly, it comes with a rule book, not a strategy guide. You need to add those strategies. You need to figure out, based on the game that we're playing of building products, potentially software, what are the tools that I need to make that successful? 

What are the additional practices I need to add to make that successful? What are the choices I have in the way I do it that makes me, my product, and my team distinctive in the marketplace so that more people want my stuff than my competitors stuff. That for me is why Scrum is easy to understand but incredibly difficult to master because products are doing businesses.
