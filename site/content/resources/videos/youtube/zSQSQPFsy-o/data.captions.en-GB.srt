1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,440
So the question was,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,520
why is Scrum so easy to understand
but incredibly difficult to master?

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,840
And that's an interesting
and recently contentious one

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,320
because there seems
to be a prevailing idea that

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,580
if something is difficult
and hard and lots of people can't do it,

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,680
that it must be inherently broken.

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,860
And to that I would say I'm
not going to win a hundred meters race

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,040
in the Olympics no matter
how hard I try and does that mean

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,060
that that sport is inherently broken?
No it just means that I can't do it.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,480
I can try really hard
and I could probably, with lots

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,120
of practice, learn to run pretty fast
without falling on my face,

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,810
although that might be difficult.

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,620
But the reality is

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,490
that

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,460
It's only difficult

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,700
because of our
inherent baggage, right?

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,580
If you think about the
Tayloristic practices

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,280
of the past and how they impose themselves
throughout the entire hierarchy

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,280
of an organization, the entire
structure of an organization.

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,660
And we're talking about moving
to something different.

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,440
And Scrum's purpose,

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,320
one of Scrum's purposes is transparency,

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,910
right?

24
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:33,780
It's designed so that by implementing it,

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,920
it makes transparent things
that make empiricism difficult in

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,600
your organization.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,780
So it's gonna be hard,
right? Because lots

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,250
of organizations are not set up
for accepting empiricism

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,040
right many organizations
have vanity metrics

30
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,060
have have enforced ways of working
that work for one team over here somewhere

31
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,230
but don't work for all
of these other teams.

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,700
So that idea

33
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,280
that Scrum is easy to understand
I think is also a little bit of a fallacy

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,260
because it's not that easy to understand.
If it was easy to understand

35
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,510
you wouldn't have thousands
of books on the Scrum Guide, right?

36
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,540
It's not easy to understand.

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,560
It's easy to read the words,

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,880
it's fast to read the words,

39
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,440
but understanding the theory
and first principles that are embedded

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
in there, understanding the,

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,500
like, what are we at, what is the purpose

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,460
for each of the events?

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,980
What are we supposed to get
out of it? Because Almost all

44
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,100
of the events that teams do
that I go see don't fulfill

45
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,400
the purpose described in the Chrome guide.

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,790
A good example of that
is the sprint review.

47
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,990
The purpose of the sprint review
is to figure out what's next.

48
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,580
It's to take into account
since the last sprint review,

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,880
the product has changed,
the business has changed,

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,900
right? They might
have changed their mind,

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,020
they might have changed direction,
The market might have changed.

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,590
How did those things affect
the transparency of the product backlog?

53
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,380
If the product backlog
is meant to be a transparent list of

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,140
our current best understanding
of what's next,

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,240
How does what's happened
in the last two weeks affect that?

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,060
And very rarely do I find
teams actually walking out

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,250
of sprint planning
with an updated product backlog,

58
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,950
right?

59
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,210
With that information embedded
in there, They've reordered the backlog

60
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,360
with the stakeholders.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,350
They've brought in that information.
They've asked the right questions.

62
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,390
What I see most teams
do is they demo the product,

63
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,640
ask for feedback.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,760
They don't get any feedback
or limited feedback or that one person

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,600
that shouts, and then they're done.
That's not a sprint review,

66
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,710
right? So that's
why it's not easy to understand

67
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,970
and it's not hard to do.

68
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,880
Sorry.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,130
Yeah. It's not
easy to understand,

70
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,620
it's hard to do, and the outcomes
that people get are so varied because

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,140
of those incompatibilities

72
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,820
between what people interpret
as the thing versus the actual thing.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
And that, I think,

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,920
is not it's I was going to say,
that's frustrating, right?

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,540
But I don't think it is.
I think it's part of the fun,

76
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,230
right?

77
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,540
It's how do we, how do we,
how, every company need,

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,010
every company and every
team needs to be unique.

79
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,380
Otherwise there's no point
in them being there, right?

80
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,840
If I can just get another
team to do it or another company

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,980
to provide that product, why would I use
your company versus that company?

82
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,020
It all comes down to price, right?

83
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,800
It shouldn't be about price.
It's about value that's being delivered.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,980
How do you create
an organizational structure?

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,310
How do you create a team ethos, a product

86
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,280
that is unique and distinct
in the market so that you build more value

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,930
and that that that's
that's these unique interpretations

88
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,230
of the Scrum Guide.

89
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,100
These unique practices
that you add to the Scrum guide.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,420
Scrum's just a little
rule book, right?

91
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,560
It's like when you go out
and buy Monopoly, it comes

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,550
with a rule book, not a strategy guide.

93
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,300
You need to add those strategies.

94
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,060
You need to figure out, based on the game
that we're playing of building products,

95
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,580
potentially software, what are the tools
that I need to make that successful?

96
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,810
What are the additional practices
I need to add to make that successful?

97
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,570
What are the choices I have
in the way I do it that makes me,

98
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,740
my product, and my team
distinctive in the marketplace so

99
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,040
that more people want
my stuff than my competitors stuff.

100
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:59,440
That for me is why
Scrum is easy to understand

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,580
but incredibly difficult to master
because products are doing businesses.
