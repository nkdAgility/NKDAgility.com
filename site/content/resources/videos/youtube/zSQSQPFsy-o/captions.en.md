foreign

so the question was

um why is Scrum so easy to understand

but incredibly difficult to master

and that that's an interesting and

recently contentious one because there's

there seems to be a prevailing

idea that if something is difficult and

hard and lots of people can't do it

that it must be inherently broken

and to that I would say I I'm not gonna

win a hundred meters race in the

Olympics no matter how hard I try and

does that mean that that sport is

inherently broken no it just means that

I can't do it I can try really hard and

I could probably with lots of practice

learn to run pretty fast without falling

on my face although that might be

difficult but the reality is that

um

um

it it it's only difficult

because of our inherent baggage right

um if you think about the the

tayloristic practices of the past and

how they impose themselves throughout

the entire hierarchy of an organization

the entire structure of an organization

and we're we're talking about moving to

something different and scrum's purpose

one of one of scrum's purposes is

transparency

right it's designed so that by

implementing it

it makes transparent

things that make empiricism difficult in

your organization

so it's gonna be hard right because lots

of organizations are not set up for

accepting empiricism right many

organizations have vanity metrics have

have uh uh enforced ways of working that

work for one team over here somewhere

but don't work for all of these other

teams so

um that idea that that scrum is easy to

understand I think is also has a little

bit of a fallacy because it's not that

easy to understand if it was easy to

understand you wouldn't have thousands

of books on the Chrome guide right it's

it's not easy to understand the the

it's easy to read the words it's fast to

read the words

but understanding the theory and first

principles that are embedded in there

understanding the the the like what are

we at what is the purpose

for for each of the events what are we

supposed to get out of it because almost

almost all

um of the events that teams do that I go

see

um are are don't fulfill the purpose

described in the Chrome guide right

um a good example of that is the the

Sprint review

um the purpose of the Sprint review

is to figure out what's next

it's to to to take into account since

the last Sprint review the product has

changed the business has changed

right they might change their mind they

might change direction the market might

have changed

how did those things affect the

transparency of the product backlog If

the product backlog is meant to be a

transparent list of our current best

understanding of what's next

how does what's happened in the last two

weeks affect that

and and very rarely do I find teams

actually walking out of Sprint planning

with an updated product backlog right

with with that information embedded in

there they've they've reordered the

backlog with the stakeholders they've uh

brought in that information they've

asked the right questions what I see

most teams do is they demo the product

ask for feedback they don't get any

feedback or limited feedback or that one

person that shouts and then they're done

that's not a Sprint review right so

that's that's why it's it's not easy to

understand and it's not hard to do sorry

yeah it's not easy to understand it's

hard to do and the outcomes that people

get are so varied because of those

incompatibilities between what people

interpret as The Thing versus the actual

thing and that that I think is

um

it's not it's I was going to say that

that's frustrating right but I don't

think it is I think it's part of the fun

right it's it's how do we how do we how

every company need every company and

every team needs to be unique otherwise

there's no point in them being there

right if I can just get another team to

do it or another company to provide that

product why would I use your company

versus that company it all comes down to

price right it shouldn't be about price

it's about value that's being delivered

how do you create an organizational

structure how do you create a team ethos

a product that is unique and distinct in

the markets so that you build more value

and that that that's that's these unique

interpretations of the scrum guide these

unique uh practices that you add to the

scrum guide scrum's just a little

rulebook right it's like when you go out

and buy Monopoly it comes with a rule

book not a strategy guide you need to

add those strategies you need to figure

out based on the game that we're playing

of Building Products potentially

software

what are the tools that I need to make

that successful what are the additional

practices I need to add to make that

successful what are the choices I have

and the way I do it that makes me my

product and my team distinctive in the

marketplace so that more people want my

stuff than my competitor's stuff that

for me is is is is is why

scrum is easy to understand but

incredibly difficult to master because

products are doing businesses
