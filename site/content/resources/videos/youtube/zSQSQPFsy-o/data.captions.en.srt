1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,559
foreign

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,960
so the question was

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,199
um why is Scrum so easy to understand

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,180
but incredibly difficult to master

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,460
and that that's an interesting and

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,580
recently contentious one because there's

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,800
there's there seems to be a prevailing

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,619
idea that if something is difficult and

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,099
hard and lots of people can't do it

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,719
that it must be inherently broken

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,340
and to that I would say I I'm not gonna

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,440
win a hundred meters race in the

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,000
Olympics no matter how hard I try and

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,160
does that mean that that sport is

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,040
inherently broken no it just means that

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,960
I can't do it I can try really hard and

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,600
I could probably with lots of practice

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,039
learn to run pretty fast without falling

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,420
on my face although that might be

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,399
difficult but the reality is that

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,399
um

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,399
um

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,600
it it it's only difficult

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,280
because of our inherent baggage right

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,380
um if you think about the the

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,240
tayloristic practices of the past and

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,100
how they impose themselves throughout

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,960
the entire hierarchy of an organization

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,479
the entire structure of an organization

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
and we're we're talking about moving to

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,759
something different and scrum's purpose

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
one of one of scrum's purposes is

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,580
transparency

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,320
right it's designed so that by

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,799
implementing it

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,000
it makes transparent

37
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,220
things that make empiricism difficult in

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,920
your organization

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,079
so it's gonna be hard right because lots

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,020
of organizations are not set up for

41
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,880
accepting empiricism right many

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,540
organizations have vanity metrics have

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,000
have uh uh enforced ways of working that

44
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,439
work for one team over here somewhere

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
but don't work for all of these other

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,079
teams so

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,539
um that idea that that scrum is easy to

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,160
understand I think is also has a little

49
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,900
bit of a fallacy because it's not that

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,459
easy to understand if it was easy to

51
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,739
understand you wouldn't have thousands

52
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,060
of books on the Chrome guide right it's

53
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:25,020
it's not easy to understand the the

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,520
it's easy to read the words it's fast to

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,940
read the words

56
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,480
but understanding the theory and first

57
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,599
principles that are embedded in there

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,420
understanding the the the like what are

59
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,120
we at what is the purpose

60
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,879
for for each of the events what are we

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,860
supposed to get out of it because almost

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,120
almost all

63
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,620
um of the events that teams do that I go

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,660
see

65
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,900
um are are don't fulfill the purpose

66
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,640
described in the Chrome guide right

67
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,200
um a good example of that is the the

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,660
Sprint review

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,180
um the purpose of the Sprint review

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,300
is to figure out what's next

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,580
it's to to to take into account since

72
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,580
the last Sprint review the product has

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,200
changed the business has changed

74
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,480
right they might change their mind they

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,280
might change direction the market might

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,920
have changed

77
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,959
how did those things affect the

78
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,400
transparency of the product backlog If

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,379
the product backlog is meant to be a

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,019
transparent list of our current best

81
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:32,700
understanding of what's next

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,159
how does what's happened in the last two

83
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,920
weeks affect that

84
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,780
and and very rarely do I find teams

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,480
actually walking out of Sprint planning

86
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,819
with an updated product backlog right

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
with with that information embedded in

88
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,500
there they've they've reordered the

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,000
backlog with the stakeholders they've uh

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,220
brought in that information they've

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,019
asked the right questions what I see

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,599
most teams do is they demo the product

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,459
ask for feedback they don't get any

94
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,780
feedback or limited feedback or that one

95
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,599
person that shouts and then they're done

96
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,060
that's not a Sprint review right so

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,540
that's that's why it's it's not easy to

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,599
understand and it's not hard to do sorry

99
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,060
yeah it's not easy to understand it's

100
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,299
hard to do and the outcomes that people

101
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,579
get are so varied because of those

102
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,400
incompatibilities between what people

103
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:27,120
interpret as The Thing versus the actual

104
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,240
thing and that that I think is

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,240
um

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,580
it's not it's I was going to say that

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,259
that's frustrating right but I don't

108
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,500
think it is I think it's part of the fun

109
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:42,300
right it's it's how do we how do we how

110
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,580
every company need every company and

111
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,840
every team needs to be unique otherwise

112
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,880
there's no point in them being there

113
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,500
right if I can just get another team to

114
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,940
do it or another company to provide that

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,800
product why would I use your company

116
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,380
versus that company it all comes down to

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,300
price right it shouldn't be about price

118
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,360
it's about value that's being delivered

119
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,180
how do you create an organizational

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,199
structure how do you create a team ethos

121
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,120
a product that is unique and distinct in

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,120
the markets so that you build more value

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,000
and that that that's that's these unique

124
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,180
interpretations of the scrum guide these

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,580
unique uh practices that you add to the

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,380
scrum guide scrum's just a little

127
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,180
rulebook right it's like when you go out

128
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,340
and buy Monopoly it comes with a rule

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,259
book not a strategy guide you need to

130
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,380
add those strategies you need to figure

131
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:33,900
out based on the game that we're playing

132
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,979
of Building Products potentially

133
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,960
software

134
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,400
what are the tools that I need to make

135
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,259
that successful what are the additional

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,180
practices I need to add to make that

137
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,940
successful what are the choices I have

138
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,060
and the way I do it that makes me my

139
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,680
product and my team distinctive in the

140
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,500
marketplace so that more people want my

141
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,940
stuff than my competitor's stuff that

142
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,759
for me is is is is is that it's it's why

143
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,740
scrum is easy to understand but

144
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,660
incredibly difficult to master because

145
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,660
products are doing businesses
