1
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,369
you

2
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:46,670
hello my name is Martin hen chouet I'm

3
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,000
here with Daniel Vacanti who was one of

4
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:52,130
the original contributors on the Kanban

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,670
method in the quarry creator of the

6
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:58,550
Kanban guide for scrum teams and the

7
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,070
professional scrum with Kanban class how

8
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,630
you doing Daniel I'm doing great thanks

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,960
great to see you're marking great to be

10
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,820
here

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:12,650
cool and I had a UH obviously we're all

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,780
stuck in our homes for the foreseeable

13
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,880
future at the moment I don't think

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,250
there's anywhere now that's just you can

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,430
just go run around and I hear you're a

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,910
lover of tennis a little a little birdie

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,970
called Scott let me know and he was

18
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:32,690
wondering how you were coping without

19
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,400
tennis not pretty well I think the

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,080
harder thing is that there's no stennis

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,390
to wash you know there's big postponed

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,770
the whole tennis season until at least

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,060
June in this and the decision about

24
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,619
Wimbledon was supposed to come out today

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,950
I didn't see did that put that could

26
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,539
publish it I have to I have to go check

27
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,070
but but as we were chatting before

28
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,140
there's there's actual I've got some

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,000
neighborhoods coherent as long as I'm

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,550
allowed out once a day to go it was

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,369
exercise and I was I practice proper

32
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,050
social distancing then I'm actually

33
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,179
coping not too bad probably better than

34
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,039
even many people so thanks for asking I

35
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,929
don't know what what about you and Vasco

36
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,160
I mean it's told mr. aney so you

37
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,470
probably own it be inside anymore it's

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,050
actually in it's not been too bad it's

39
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:16,420
been um six or seven degrees so we've

40
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,420
been out sunbathing in the front garden

41
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,500
it's actually it's actually been okay

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,209
it's been a bit cloudy the last couple

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,310
of days but there's been some sunshine

44
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,830
so we've been running out to sit in the

45
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,120
garden when it's sunny cuz it's nice and

46
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,950
warm in the Sun but then the Sun goes

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,860
away in it temperature drops quite

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,830
significantly but yeah we're able to go

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,600
out for for walks as long as we're

50
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,690
there's not too many people in one place

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,400
so it's been pretty good but we've we've

52
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:48,620
been getting kind of daily notifications

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,250
of what's going on I'm sure the same as

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,270
yourself although your

55
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:59,370
briefings are a little bit more

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:03:04,650
interesting than ours but yeah so um we

57
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:07,920
you and I will be co-teaching a Kanban

58
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,110
class and we're going to teach our

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,340
professional scrum with Kanban as a live

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:19,080
virtual classroom on the 18th of 18th

61
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,610
and 19th of May and Edinburgh and can

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,610
you tell us a little bit about the class

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,010
you think it'd be ready with the stock

64
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,530
answer for that right but it's it's

65
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,850
really about for those you know those

66
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,670
those people have been practicing scrum

67
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,380
for a while and for whatever reason I

68
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,420
haven't gotten everything that we went

69
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,790
to out of scrum or maybe just want to

70
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,989
take their you know comes from skills to

71
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:49,440
the next level or whatever it's really

72
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,760
about introducing the concept of flow to

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,590
solve some of those problems that you

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,900
may or may not seem as Francis you know

75
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,700
things like we're know hey we're we're

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,170
terrible at estimating and we can never

77
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,370
first know how much stuff gets done in

78
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,480
this broth no can't ever tell their

79
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,430
products under when something is going

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,920
to be done at the end of this prints

81
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,330
there's always a smash - who says we've

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,730
taken on too much work or we can never

83
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,410
get it done you know so you know how how

84
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,229
does flow how does management the flow

85
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,049
just help to solve some of those common

86
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:22,830
problems that you see you know it's in

87
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:26,520
several scrum teams cool so how does

88
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:32,520
that and how does that differ from the

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:34,080
Kanban method it differs it doesn't it

90
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,940
doesn't matter for quite a bit in

91
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,040
several respects probably the biggest

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:45,870
biggest things the biggest difference is

93
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:51,060
the beauty of scrum stolen supplies and

94
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:53,639
entirety hire T so easy easy pile on a

95
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,830
professional professional scrub

96
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,650
this concept because difficulty take a

97
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:04,590
look at the professionals come for

98
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:11,759
example it's less than right inherited

99
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:14,939
they're able to keep it as fat as we

100
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,569
come you know as a foundation as our

101
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:21,259
base so if you go depending on which

102
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:23,430
other combine guide you you look at

103
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,710
necessarily get into that too much but

104
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,050
you know there's there's a there's a

105
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,569
combine you know a condensed combine

106
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,889
guide that is ninety some pages or one

107
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:33,599
hundred some pages or whatever which

108
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,169
doesn't sound too it's convinced to me

109
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,529
or whatever

110
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:41,129
old I said sounds like it's very big yes

111
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:43,050
I think that's that's the big the

112
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,779
biggest difference is we have scrum as

113
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,370
our foundation we embrace everything

114
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,810
that scrum does we're not we're not

115
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,069
changing anything in scrum we're not

116
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,050
throwing anything out we're not doing

117
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:54,839
any of that you know take your existing

118
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,939
scrum implementation just kind of bolt

119
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,750
on or overlay some of these practices on

120
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:03,810
top and you're good to go

121
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:06,180
cool so there's a couple people hearings

122
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,639
a little bit of feedback I've ordered a

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,930
set of headphones from upstairs

124
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,430
I hear they might be on their way but

125
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,620
what I'll do is at the moment I'll mute

126
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:21,270
myself when you're speaking down and

127
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,469
then maybe that will will help where do

128
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,770
we get that mute button for real life

129
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:27,629
how do i how do I do that

130
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,199
there there is no mute button for me

131
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:34,169
personally my wife has tried and but it

132
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,610
doesn't work usually a few men's I'm

133
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:42,210
just throwing the remote control at me

134
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:47,580
for sure yeah so I'm wondering if any of

135
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:52,830
the folks that are listening online have

136
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,979
any questions as well let's let me have

137
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,979
a look

138
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:04,629
I got a different headphones than I was

139
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:09,580
expecting

140
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:12,669
that's okay so I guess have you have you

141
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,050
thought about um the the tools that we

142
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:27,330
want to use while we're teaching this

143
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:34,389
class no longer is I've been

144
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:37,839
conversations past that's kind of

145
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,639
Baseball America no we have we tend to

146
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:46,269
use the same we have the same expression

147
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:51,610
intricate as well proper sport I don't

148
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:58,479
yeah anyway we you know we've been

149
00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:00,819
forced to adapt really look really look

150
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,379
like and because it is you know

151
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,879
fortunately or unfortunately science

152
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,800
itself is designed to do you know very

153
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,809
interactive very hands-on best way to

154
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,479
learn about this sterility sleeves and

155
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:12,579
do it yeah so at a point I mean how do

156
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:20,619
we how do we bring in some some tools to

157
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:22,449
leverage the online experience so it's

158
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:27,129
may be now may not be as good you know

159
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:30,999
it's it's hard to say but we do have an

160
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:34,569
online combat simulation that we can do

161
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:38,649
so there's that but the rest of it who

162
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:39,939
knows we'll just just kind of see I'm

163
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,339
kind of excited to see how this plays

164
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:43,539
out interested to get feedback from

165
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,370
people who have taken to escape

166
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,519
virtually that works and what doesn't

167
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,550
work

168
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,899
yeah I've been thinking of doing some

169
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:56,649
free sessions with folks for different

170
00:08:52,899 --> 00:09:01,660
parts of the exercises and to see if I

171
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:02,740
can figure out how best to do that I've

172
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,399
been toying around with a couple of

173
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,290
tools obviously zoom for the video

174
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,930
conferencing it seems to be the one that

175
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,810
has the

176
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,130
I prefer teams when I'm doing stuff but

177
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,320
it doesn't have breakout rooms it

178
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,050
doesn't have that kind of interact

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,839
ability you could do it but it would be

180
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,230
a pain in the ass so not gonna go there

181
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:28,730
so zoom for that mural have you played

182
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:31,279
with mural yet because that seems to be

183
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:36,589
the to go to kind of whiteboard

184
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:40,820
collaborative space choice so yeah I'm

185
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:57,080
sure we'll do some of that we'll see

186
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:59,240
yeah employment yep so I'm being shouted

187
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,580
at for having a an echo while you're

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,740
talking I do have headphones now and

189
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,890
I've plugged them in but it's not

190
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:12,140
outputting the audio to the headphones

191
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,459
so I'm just switching that over I don't

192
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,810
even know how to do that it's supposed

193
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:19,760
to just do that when you plug in your

194
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:25,610
headphones nope I think they just don't

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,230
work I will have to mute you while

196
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,160
you're talk what mute myself while

197
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,930
you're talking is what I need to do so

198
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,350
I've been I've been playing with our

199
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:40,670
tool you know that I'm into board games

200
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:44,990
a little bit and there's an online tool

201
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:48,260
called table topia which is uh basically

202
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,089
as a board game simulator so it doesn't

203
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,670
do any of anything clever

204
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,310
apart from have the PCs on the table and

205
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,990
you can has tools for flipping cards and

206
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,510
drawing cards from a deck and rolling

207
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,870
dice and that kind of thing and I was

208
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:09,260
thinking about I've been chopping up the

209
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:13,970
v-2 of the get Kanban game to load into

210
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:17,060
this tool and see if it's usable as a

211
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,490
tool to still use the the get Kanban

212
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,350
game and I haven't seen another online

213
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:26,950
version of

214
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,950
- that's why your honor

215
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,960
I thought I should this link with you

216
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,740
but but we we have it's not exactly get

217
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,560
Kanban but it is a compound simulation

218
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,360
it's called it's called twig twig stands

219
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,420
for the whip game and there's an online

220
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,950
version of that that we will be using as

221
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:49,890
as part of a class so in fact I've

222
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,990
actually I don't I don't know if I

223
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,580
should be saying this out loud or not

224
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,410
but I don't use get comp on in my PS

225
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,380
Ches anymore I used this this online

226
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,660
simulation because I think in general I

227
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,320
think it's a little bit better learning

228
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,850
experience for for lots of reasons

229
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,210
so that'll be that'll be something that

230
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,250
we'll get a chance to see probably we'll

231
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,630
send out a link to the game beforehand

232
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,070
so people might might get a chance to

233
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,500
play around with it before the class I'm

234
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,520
not I'm not sure about that we're we're

235
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,170
kind of going back and forth whether

236
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,720
that's a good idea or not I agree I

237
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,010
think it's um having having something a

238
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,590
little bit different might be maybe

239
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:32,400
better I'd like to hear about the

240
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:34,680
simulator that you you have maybe I can

241
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,690
integrate that into into what it is that

242
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,920
we're we're doing I I'm just playing

243
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,280
around with table topia because I'm

244
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:50,130
using it anyway to get my fix from board

245
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:53,610
games Scott just said get can ban on

246
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:57,540
fortnight and shoot Carlos I think a lot

247
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:00,810
of the folks that are on the the chat

248
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,630
have have played get combat before

249
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,400
probably have copies of get Kanban and

250
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,660
although somebody's putting a little

251
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
question mark going what were they

252
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,070
talking about you don't know until

253
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,110
you've played the game and it's a

254
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,740
surprise that should not be spoiled for

255
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,170
you and but it's part of that little

256
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,910
little story and actually I really like

257
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,990
to get combined game because of that

258
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,090
that story and people and when they're

259
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,490
playing the game tend to interact very

260
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,410
heavily with it and they understand the

261
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,680
rules a lot more quickly because it's a

262
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,620
gamification and have you seen those are

263
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,589
there's a tool and that's just come up

264
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,069
to a board game from

265
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:50,759
called scrum tail in Poland that has

266
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:54,480
just come out and there is em they've

267
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,139
created our board game for for a group

268
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,550
of eight people working together to

269
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,220
instead of building software which

270
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,959
you'll know we do in the PSF which is a

271
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,059
little bit fun because you sometimes

272
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,559
teach classes with people who don't know

273
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:16,740
software and in this tool that you build

274
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:18,899
a murder-mystery you build a novel yeah

275
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,689
III got a demo of it at one of the

276
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,980
conferences that I went to and it was it

277
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,499
was really really powerful

278
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,410
so that's scrum tail which I really

279
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:30,600
enjoyed interacting with and it was good

280
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,120
for that when you've got a big class of

281
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,240
people who don't have any scrum

282
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,249
knowledge and similar to get Kanban it

283
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,079
doesn't it's not really a software

284
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:45,959
specific thing cool

285
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,350
so yes Darren you got Table Talk er

286
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,959
spelt correctly if you google for it

287
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,809
you'll find lots of stuff around that as

288
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:58,740
well and so the the class that will be

289
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:02,490
teaching is um on Monday the 18th of May

290
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,259
um it'll be I think we're we're

291
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,319
currently thinking it's going to be up

292
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:10,470
to day a two-day class roughly the same

293
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:13,439
timing as an in-person class and I guess

294
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,660
in subsequent teaches we may change that

295
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:18,839
but I think for for a one-off it's going

296
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,769
to be like that Daniel it's gonna be a

297
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:30,300
bit of a difficult time zone for you I

298
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:31,800
make it work long as we finish we can

299
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,939
certainly finish with whisky you can

300
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:39,269
drink whisky I'll drink to rum so it

301
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:44,720
usually runs from 9:00 until 5:00

302
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,720
I don't know what what's 9 a.m. in here

303
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:55,470
yeah we did although nobody noticed

304
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:57,510
because we were all in asleep it's

305
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:03,540
pretty early you maybe need a whiskey to

306
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:09,029
start when you're doing some of the

307
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:11,670
exercises I did work on a scrum team in

308
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:15,330
Sydney Australia from Glasgow with a 12

309
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,310
hour time difference that was not a lot

310
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,850
of fun it was a good demonstration of

311
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:25,950
how remote work cannot work if you're in

312
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,540
different time zones well I should I had

313
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:38,580
four people on my team from Beijing as

314
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:40,620
well accent yeah well I'll think we'll

315
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,450
maybe wrap it up there is there any

316
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,450
other questions that you had Daniel

317
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:58,040
likes to experiment with or special

318
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:11,670
experimentation for all so I think

319
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:15,030
Martin and I are willing to learn as all

320
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,429
of you so yeah please please just just

321
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,990
just drop us a line just you know

322
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:21,420
whatever ideas you've got do you have to

323
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,540
hear cool yeah yeah we are we're

324
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,510
planning on running the the class we'd

325
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:29,400
like to get as many people I I don't

326
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,440
know what what what are you thinking the

327
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,679
limit is going to be maybe 12 or 13

328
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,270
people something like that for our first

329
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,290
class

330
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:42,480
and just figure out how to how to push

331
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:46,650
around facilitating facilitating that

332
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,540
for us yeah cool

333
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,370
well thanks very much Daniel for for

334
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,430
making the time I know you had to move

335
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,400
something around to get with us at five

336
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,070
o'clock and if anybody has any questions

337
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,720
they can message me or Daniel directly

338
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,570
it's on Twitter

339
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,670
everywhere same as myself and we'll

340
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,580
figure out how to do the best part oh I

341
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:13,140
would note that for the kanban class and

342
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:15,410
I do or we do for this class we do a

343
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,820
discount for people that are unemployed

344
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:20,190
which might be a lot of people at the

345
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,980
moment we also do discounts for people

346
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,320
that are self funding the class as well

347
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,180
so if your company's paying companies

348
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,760
don't get a discount just people real

349
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,860
people get discounts companies do not I

350
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,520
think that's kind of the best way to go

351
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,740
with that very Scottish I agree cool

352
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,990
well thank you very much for for for

353
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,340
joining us and apologies for the audio

354
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,240
West you I'll try and figure it out for

355
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:46,230
the next one of these that we do okay

356
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,460
thanks everybody for joining thanks for

357
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,900
the invitation my cringe is great chat

358
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,900
no hnt as well Daniel
