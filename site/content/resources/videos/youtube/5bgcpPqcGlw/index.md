In my journey through the world of [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}) and [site reliability engineering]({{< ref "/tags/site-reliability-engineering" >}}), I've come to appreciate the delicate balance between engineering and operations. Today, I want to share insights from my experiences with the Azure [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}) team at Microsoft, particularly how they foster a live site culture that prioritises reliability while delivering value to customers.

### The Importance of Site Reliability Engineering

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is not just a buzzword; it’s a critical discipline that ensures systems are robust and resilient. My work with various clients has shown me that operational needs are just as vital as engineering requirements. The [Azure DevOps]({{< ref "/tags/azure-devops" >}}) team exemplifies how to create a culture that supports both.

#### Key Elements of a Successful Live Site Culture

1. **[Transparency]({{< ref "/tags/transparency" >}}) Builds Trust**: 
   - The Azure DevOps team prioritises transparency with their customers. They publish detailed post-mortems after outages, outlining what went wrong, the steps taken to resolve the issue, and how they plan to prevent it in the future. This level of openness fosters trust and reassures customers that their concerns are taken seriously.

2. **Telemetry is Essential**: 
   - Collecting and organising telemetry data is crucial. The Azure DevOps team has developed a comprehensive telemetry pipeline that allows them to monitor system performance and user interactions. This data is invaluable for identifying trends and potential issues before they escalate.

3. **Automation is Key**: 
   - In an agile environment, automation is not just a luxury; it’s a necessity. The Azure DevOps team has embraced automation to ensure that their applications are always in a deployable state. This means that when the business decides to ship to production, the engineering team is not burdened with additional work. The [product owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) can simply push a button.

4. **Incident Response and [Continuous Improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}})**: 
   - When incidents occur, the Azure DevOps team is quick to respond. They have a structured approach to incident management, which includes creating incident bridges with all necessary stakeholders. This ensures that everyone is aligned and working towards a resolution. Post-incident reviews are conducted to identify root causes and implement improvements.

### Learning from Past Mistakes

One of the most striking lessons I've learned comes from the story of Knight Capital Group, which lost nearly $460 million in just 45 minutes due to a deployment error. This incident highlights the catastrophic consequences of inadequate automation and lack of back-out plans. It serves as a reminder that if you cannot successfully deploy your product, the chances of rolling back a failed deployment are slim.

### Embracing Change at Microsoft

Microsoft has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade. Once a waterfall organisation, they now embrace [continuous delivery]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-delivery" >}}), deploying updates to [Windows]({{< ref "/tags/windows" >}}) and other products at an unprecedented scale. With over 160,000 deployments per day, the Azure DevOps team has demonstrated that agility and reliability can coexist.

### Building Cross-Functional Teams

A critical aspect of the Azure DevOps team's success is their shift towards cross-functional teams. By integrating roles such as security, legal, and operations into the engineering teams, they eliminate dependencies that can slow down progress. This approach not only enhances agility but also ensures that all perspectives are considered when developing and maintaining products.

### Conclusion: The Path Forward

As I reflect on the practices of the Azure DevOps team, it becomes clear that quality and transparency are paramount in building customer trust. By automating processes, collecting comprehensive telemetry, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, organisations can navigate the complexities of modern software development.

If you're looking to enhance your own team's reliability and agility, consider adopting some of these practices. Remember, the goal is not just to deliver features but to ensure that your systems are robust and your customers are satisfied.
