 **This session was supposed to be don't at this time at Techorama BE**

With the shift-left movement pushing more responsibility to the engineering teams what practices will help them cope with running a production site. These are the experience of the Azure DevOps Services team and their journey from on-premises to a fully-fledged SAAS solution and way they need to do to run it and build trust with their customers. We will cover the importance of transparency, telemetry, on-call, and how to protect your feature teams from disruptions without them losing touch with production. Focus: many teams, big public services, build-test-run.
