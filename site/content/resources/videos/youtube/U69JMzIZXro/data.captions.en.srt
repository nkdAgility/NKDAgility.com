1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,480
we're going to look at installing a

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,880
standard single server and for TFS so

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,719
the first thing I'm going to do

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,719
is install SQL

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,279
Server there we

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,920
go this will run the secet server

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,920
install have to apply service pack one

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,920
afterwards in order to install TFS 2013

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,920
now we're going to select a new SQL

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
Server Standalone we'll add the features

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
to it now we're doing a single server

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,399
everything on the one box and I am

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,399
joined to a domain and so we can get all

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
the the goodness of credentials

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040
so I now have a a warning for the

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
firewall which I'm not worried about

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,920
because it's going to be all in one box

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,240
um and it's completed all the kind of

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,400
prerequisite tasks that it's uh squl

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,040
needs so we're going to do a SQL Server

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,000
feature installation um we don't really

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,360
need the other uh features at the moment

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,119
and we're we're going to configure some

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,479
of the

25
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,720
things so in order to do a a kind of

26
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,560
full standard TFS install we need the

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,799
database Engine Services and include the

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,799
full text uh for search we need that for

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,920
TFS we're also going to install analysis

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,079
services and Reporting Services now what

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,079
I usually do when I installing uh SQL

32
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,799
servers I'll also install the management

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,280
tools but which allow us access uh to

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,360
configure and operate SQL server and we

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,119
don't really need to be able to do much

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,039
and because TFS is going to manage the

37
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,039
for us um

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,560
but that should give us um all of the

39
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,560
capabilities that we

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,920
need so I'm just going to take the

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,720
default instance name um that tends to

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,000
be um prefer especially if you're just

43
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
doing a single server

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,200
install as for service accounts um you

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,360
want to try and leave it as the default

46
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,840
if you can and these service accounts

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,280
are all preconfigured in Windows to

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,920
operate as you as you would expect and

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
in a single server instance where we

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,720
don't need communication with SQL Server

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,400
from outside of the server this is the

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,000
best option and to be honest even on

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,040
multi- server deployments this is the

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,680
best option as well as long as your

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,360
network will support it and it depends

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,360
the version of active directory I'm

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,599
running uh 2012 hour two active

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,599
directory so I shouldn't have any

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:29,319
problems now uh by default there are no

60
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,560
users specifically added um to connect

61
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,120
to TF so I'm going to add the current

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,120
user uh which is

63
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,959
myself and I'm also going to add uh the

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,680
service account under which uh TFS is

65
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,680
going to run so that

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,640
is TFS service I'm fairly sure there we

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
go TFS

68
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,519
service I'm going to make sure that has

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
access and I'm going to leave the data

70
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,079
directories and the file stream as is

71
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,000
you may want to put the data directories

72
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,159
on a separate Drive we're going to have

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,400
backup set up later um so that shouldn't

74
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,920
be an issue analysis Services um we are

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,959
going to install in multi-dimensional

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,680
and data mining mode this is the only

77
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,160
mode that's supported currently by TFS

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,519
Jeff levenson has a um module for

79
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,880
enabling a tabular mode but you need a

80
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
separate analysis server that plugs into

81
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,880
the existing Data Warehouse in order to

82
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,560
achieve that so again I'm going to add

83
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,560
the current user and add a TFS service

84
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,520
there we go and for reporting Services

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,080
we're going to install and configure and

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,080
we require the configuration so that

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,720
there's a database there waiting for us

88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,199
if we do install only we wouldd have to

89
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,199
configure reporting Services manually

90
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,240
afterward cut

91
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,320
there we're going to use uh install and

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,800
configure um if we don't do uh configure

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
we have to configure it manually

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
afterwards and this just take a little

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,160
bit of time to create the database

96
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,160
that this will do it for

97
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,880
us

98
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,400
so you can check that you have

99
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,840
everything ready to install and make

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,560
sure that you have the correct account

101
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,560
setup and then just click

102
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
install

103
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

104
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

106
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,039
there we go we have um SQL Server

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,759
installed with the management tools

108
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,159
database engine analysis services and

109
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,520
Reporting services

110
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,479
so now all we need to do is make sure

111
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,400
that we have service pack one applied so

112
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,400
let me copy service pack one onto this

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:21,879
machine service pipe one is about a gig

114
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,879
um so it may take a moment to run

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,479
and I

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,479
that there we go on S pack

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,200
here we go let start the update

118
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,720
fantastic now we have a SQL Server

119
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,760
service pack one all installed and

120
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,760
configured so let me close

121
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,560
that now we need to install team

122
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,320
Foundation

123
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,320
server so let me

124
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,120
open my team foration server

125
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,760
dis now we should be able to just

126
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,600
install uh straight forward team

127
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,880
Foundation server and then when the

128
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,720
wizard comes up after the install is

129
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,760
complete we're going to pick the

130
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,760
standard single server

131
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
option

132
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

134
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

135
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
for e

136
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,680
there we go the installation of TFS is

137
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,160
complete we still have to configure it

138
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,720
it's not really installed yet it's just

139
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,600
the files are there um and we're just

140
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,160
going to pick a trial license just now

141
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,160
you'll get your actual license off

142
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,279
msdn

143
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,120
awesome we can now run a standard uh

144
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,880
single server

145
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,440
install now we want to use the the

146
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,720
default instance

147
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,720
of um SQL

148
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,800
server and if this wasn't a Server 2012

149
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,600
R2 which doesn't support SharePoint

150
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,000
2013 and then it would install

151
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,680
SharePoint 2013 for us just the default

152
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,839
SharePoint Foundation um that will be

153
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,720
supported from service pack one of

154
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,160
SharePoint 2013 but it's just not there

155
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,040
yet now if you want to use remote uh

156
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,040
database servers remote uh SharePoint or

157
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,279
reporting Services then you would want

158
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,880
to use an advanced installation but at

159
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,320
the moment we're just going to take the

160
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,320
kind of

161
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,480
um vanilla version of TFS out of the box

162
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
standard single server if I start the

163
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,920
wizard so you have a couple of things

164
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,680
that I need to configure

165
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,079
um let me next there we go so I need a

166
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,079
service

167
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,600
account and we can use the test button

168
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,199
to check whether we've entered the

169
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
username and password correctly which we

170
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,000
have and then it's going to run a bunch

171
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,000
of system checks on whether it can

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
install a SharePoint on this machine

173
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,000
which it should come back and this is

174
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,920
correct it will say h we have two issues

175
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,519
one is we need a minimum of 8 gig memory

176
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,160
in order to install SharePoint

177
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,199
Foundation which I've not got this

178
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,240
machine set to 8 gig memory um the other

179
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,839
one is that um SharePoint Foundation is

180
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,040
not supported in the operating system

181
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,040
we're

182
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,079
using and we just need to check this and

183
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,639
say yes we are happy to continue without

184
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,639
installing um SharePoint

185
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:38,000
Foundation you can review the

186
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:42,519
configuration it's going to

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,519
have we're going to run the Readiness

188
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,680
checks so it's going to make sure that

189
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,639
the accounts that we've picked um are

190
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,560
going to H be able to communicate

191
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
properly that we can set up the server

192
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,959
that we can configure all the PC so

193
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,000
talking to reporting Services that's why

194
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,880
it's taking so long at this point

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,680
spinning up reporting Services the tier

196
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,480
and application analysis Services all of

197
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,480
those things are going to be

198
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,399
checked awesome so now that everything's

199
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,399
uh verified here we click the configure

200
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,399
button

201
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,440
okay now that uh TFS is installed

202
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,319
successfully

203
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,199
configured and we can finish up now if I

204
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,199
just go to the URL for TFS a quick test

205
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,360
to make sure everything's working we'll

206
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,360
see that at the moment we get a a popup

207
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,360
box this is actually a security thing

208
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,680
because we're on the server and but if I

209
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,680
go to

210
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,600
and put in

211
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,120
password and we will get TFS up running

212
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,000
so let me close that and you see we've

213
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,760
completed the configuration and we could

214
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,480
go on and configure the build server or

215
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,760
any the other PCS but I'm just going to

216
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,919
close this just now and you'll see there

217
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,919
we go we get this uh

218
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,839
um Internet Explorer security thing and

219
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,520
then we get JavaScript is disabled and

220
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,400
all this kind of Malak so let me quickly

221
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,480
fix

222
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,640
that if you want to fix this open up

223
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,600
your server manager go to local

224
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:43,080
server I enhanced security is on turn it

225
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,679
off cuz we actually want to be able to

226
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,320
use this

227
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,640
computer and now we go

228
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,000
to and will'll get our connected into

229
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,360
our TFS server and that's everything up

230
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,400
and running we've installed TFS if I

231
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,679
open up the admin tool you'll see that

232
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,320
we have the TFS

233
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,840
RTM

234
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,520
um and we indeed have one collection

235
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,000
with no team projects

236
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,520
currently no team projects we don't have

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,880
uh SharePoint configured but we do have

238
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,880
reporting Services configured analysis

239
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,440
services and all of those things and

240
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,640
that will be building the warehouse uh

241
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,360
behind the scenes that will take a

242
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,200
little while and usually 2 to 3 hours to

243
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,200
to get that all configured and this is a

244
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,880
completely blank server so it's probably

245
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,360
done already um but it will work away in

246
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,679
the background and that's your TFS

247
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,679
server

248
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,039
configured if I want to create a team

249
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,360
project which is the main test of TFS

250
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,200
working and it hits pretty much all the

251
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,120
components of TFS so if I open up uh

252
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,760
Visual

253
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,440
Studio I go to Team

254
00:18:50,760 --> 00:19:00,480
Explorer if I connect into my TFS

255
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,880
server and click create team project

256
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,120
now that's going to be a little bit out

257
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,280
of the bounds of the

258
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,159
display let's call

259
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,559
it my first team

260
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,960
project and we will pick the default

261
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,480
Visual Studio scrum 2013 which is the

262
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,120
only you know proper process

263
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,240
template uh we are going to pick git as

264
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:28,039
the vers control

265
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,039
system and we're going to click finish

266
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,919
perfect now we have my first team

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,559
project and we can go back over in our

268
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,039
server and if I refresh

269
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,240
this you'll see we have my first team

270
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,400
project in

271
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,400
here and if I open up the rasure

272
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,520
again oh I did that again

273
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
and we

274
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,320
browse my first team project and we can

275
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,280
navigate into that team project and

276
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,880
that's has done we have TFS installed

277
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
we've created our first team project and

278
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,320
everything's configured
