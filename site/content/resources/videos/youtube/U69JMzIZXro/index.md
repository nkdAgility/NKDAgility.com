In this post, I’m excited to share my experience of installing Team Foundation Server (TFS) on a standard single server setup. This process can seem daunting at first, but with the right steps, it can be straightforward and rewarding. Let’s dive into the details!

### Getting Started with SQL Server Installation

The first step in our journey is to install SQL Server. Here’s how I approached it:

- **Run the SQL Server Installer**: I initiated the SQL Server installation, ensuring to apply Service Pack 1 afterwards, as it’s essential for TFS 2013.
- **Select Features**: Since I was setting up a single server, I opted for a standalone installation. I included:
  - Database Engine Services
  - Full-Text Search (critical for TFS)
  - Analysis Services
  - Reporting Services

I also made sure to install the management tools, which are invaluable for configuring and operating SQL Server.

### Configuration Choices

When configuring SQL Server, I kept a few best practices in mind:

- **Instance Name**: I chose the default instance name, which simplifies the setup for a single server.
- **Service Accounts**: I left the service accounts as default, which is typically the best practice for single server instances. This avoids unnecessary complications, especially since I was on a domain.

I added my current user and the TFS service account to ensure they had the necessary access. 

### Installing TFS

With SQL Server up and running, it was time to install TFS:

- **Run the TFS Installer**: After the SQL Server installation, I launched the TFS installation wizard.
- **Select Installation Type**: I chose the standard single server option, which is perfect for a straightforward setup.
- **License Selection**: I opted for a trial license initially, knowing I could later switch to a full license from MSDN.

### Configuration Checks

During the TFS installation, I encountered a couple of checks:

- **Memory Requirements**: The wizard indicated that I needed a minimum of 8 GB of memory for SharePoint Foundation, which I didn’t have configured. However, I decided to proceed without it.
- **System Checks**: The installation wizard ran several system checks to ensure everything was in order. This step is crucial to avoid issues later on.

### Finalising the Installation

Once the checks were complete, I clicked the configure button, and TFS was successfully installed. I then tested the TFS URL to ensure everything was functioning correctly. 

### Creating My First Team Project

With TFS installed, I was eager to create my first team project:

- **Open Visual Studio**: I connected to my TFS server via Team Explorer.
- **Create Team Project**: I named it "My First Team Project," selected the default Visual Studio Scrum 2013 process template, and chose Git as the version control system.

After a quick refresh on the server, I could see my new team project listed, confirming that everything was set up correctly.

### Conclusion

Installing TFS on a single server can be a smooth process if you follow the right steps. From setting up SQL Server to configuring TFS and creating your first team project, each phase builds on the last. 

If you’re considering a similar setup, I encourage you to take your time with each step, ensuring that you understand the configurations and choices you’re making. This will not only help you avoid pitfalls but also empower you to make informed decisions as you move forward in your agile journey.
