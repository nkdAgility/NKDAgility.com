1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,319
the course will definitely change your

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,559
product development

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:12,000
game first point uh you will be able to

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:16,880
increase user

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,160
value why because you are going to um

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,760
deliberately design experiments to

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:28,640
better understand user needs and find

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,279
effective ways how to address them so we

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,200
believe this is the best way how to how

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,160
to increase user

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,079
value second

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,680
point because you will be able to to

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,719
increase user value and have this

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,879
process more conscious with a lot of

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,039
learning you are definitely on your path

16
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,600
to decrease

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,239
waste as a result H you will also

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,760
improve return on

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:06,080
investment when it comes to what the

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:11,400
team is working on so you will invest

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:15,119
based on evidence you can adjust your

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,759
budgeting based on experiments based on

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,479
the results based on the data that you

24
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:26,200
get and in the end of the day thanks to

25
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:30,000
that you can Embrace um agility

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,479
principle of simplicity so in that Pro

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,119
process you will be also

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:40,520
maximizing the amount of work that is

29
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,600
creating little or no

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:49,600
value another important point we as

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:54,000
human beings we really really often uh

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:58,560
jump into solution space immediately or

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,439
just by briefly presenting the problem

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,719
and in this class us we we want to

35
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:10,560
unlock creativity by thinking in

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,360
problems and showing a different

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,040
perspective on that so hold your horses

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,959
and let's try different experiments to

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,720
make sure that we truly understand what

40
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,120
the problem is you might be amazed how

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,519
many different solutions Maybe finally

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,599
created when we first pay a lot of

43
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,920
attention to understanding the

44
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,640
problem another

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Point some of the customers some of the

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,760
teams companies complain when it comes

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,680
to collaboration with

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,800
stakeholders with this class you

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:00,680
actually might be equipped with some

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,920
tools and ideas how to improve

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,959
collaboration uh between the teams

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,120
between the

53
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,080
stakeholders and this

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,360
collaboration may change completely

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,720
because if you invite others and you you

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,920
show them this different

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,879
perspective your product development may

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,840
start with using data not

59
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,239
opinions and in that case it might be

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:35,080
also easier for you to uh to get a green

61
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,879
light from important stakeholders but

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,599
also to show them that certain paths

63
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,760
certain ideas are not worth

64
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,000
investing so

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,680
finally I believe it's also a class that

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,439
is improving our toolbox our product

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:01,159
development toolbox because after the

68
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:04,879
class you will have a bunch of valuable

69
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:08,040
practices techniques ideas when it comes

70
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,879
to Discovery when it comes to

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,680
validation and you can start using them

72
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:19,440
immediately after after you leave leave

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,120
the class so it might be a great

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,360
beginning of changes that you will start

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,600
very soon just after you say goodbye in

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,600
our class
