Welcome to MVP rocks. My name is Martin Henwood. I'm a Visual Studio ALM MVP, Visual Studio ALM Ranger, and professional Scrum trainer. I'm here to talk to you about TFS preview. TFS preview is Microsoft's cloud-based TFS offering. It's available on TFS preview.com. It's free as long as you've got our live ID. 

Once you're logged in, you'll get to choose your account name. My account name here is Mr Hinch. Once you log into your account, you get to create a new team project. Your team project is the bucket within which we're going to do some work, and you get source control, work item tracking, a little bit of reporting, and tests. 

Now that I've got a team project called MVP rocks, I'm going to go to my backlog and I'm going to add a few generic items into my backlog. These are product backlog items I'm adding. They have a number of fields, and most of which we're not bothered about just now. We're just filling out the title. They do have a state, however, and the state will default to new. 

While I'm adding the items, you can see that there's a green line on the list. That's the place within which items are going to be added. Once I have all my items added, I probably want to stack rank them in some way so I can reorder my backlog, and that will just automatically save back behind the scenes. 

I'm going to go to my Kanban board, and you'll see that I have a number of columns. These columns represent the states that are available within that work item type. You can see also that there's a little number at the corner of each of the columns. This is my work item limit or WIP limit, work in progress limit. I'm going to set that to two and commit to two, but actually, I just want to set approved to four. 

That's my backlog. That's how many things are going to be in my queue to do, and lots of new items we don't care about. We care about what's in the approved column, what's been approved by the product owner. I can just drag items into the correct board or into the approved column. You can see that the column goes green as I'm dragging the items in. 

I'm going to put four items in there, and then I probably want to move a couple of items into my committed state. So let me move "create team project" and "add some backlog items," and you'll see that I've met my work in progress limit for my committed column. I have two of two, and it's still green. 

If I try and drag another item across, you'll see it'll go red. It will actually let me break the rules; it won't enforce the rules. That's okay. I'm smart enough to know that I shouldn't be breaking them, so I'm not going to move a new item in. I can, however, move an item over to done, and you'll see it goes green to indicate that this is all complete. 

We're in the happy, happy state. Now that I have free space in my committed column, I can drag a new item across, and I'm still within the WIP limits, so it doesn't go red. I don't get any warnings. 

These new features are only available in TFS preview right now. You won't find them in the RTM version of TFS or Visual Studio. TFS and Visual Studio are both moving to a tighter release schedule. They're releasing new features every three months, so you will see it on-premise within the next three months because we've already had the first RTM shipped version of TFS. 

Things like the new cumulative flow diagrams that you see there, I don't have any data yet, but you see it there. It will be available very soon on the on-premise TFS, but you can use it right now in the cloud by going to TFS preview.com and signing up for an account.
