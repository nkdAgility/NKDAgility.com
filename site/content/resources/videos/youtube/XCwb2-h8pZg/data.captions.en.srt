a new team project your team project is

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,640
the bucket H within which we're going to

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,359
do some work and you get Source control

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
work item

19
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,680
tracking a little bit of

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,199
reporting and

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,680
tests so now that I've got a a team

22
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:06,200
project called MVP

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,360
rocks I'm going to um go to my

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,759
backlog and I'm going to add uh a few

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,320
generic items into my backlog these are

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:15,400
product backlog items I'm added they

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,640
have a number of fields and most of

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,640
which we're not bothered about just now

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,520
we're just filling out title they do

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,479
have a state however and the state will

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,960
default to new um while I'm adding the

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,479
items you can see that there's a green

33
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,720
line on the uh list that's the the place

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,399
within which items are going to be added

35
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
once I have all my items added I

36
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,880
probably want to Stack rank them in some

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,680
way so I can reorder my backlog and that

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,640
will just automatically save back behind

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,799
the

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,520
scenes I'm going to go to my can ban

41
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,079
board and you'll see that I have a

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,040
number of columns these columns

43
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:51,320
represent the the states that are

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
available within that work item type you

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,439
can see also that there's a little

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,320
number um at the corner of each of the

47
00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:00,320
columns this is my work item uh limit or

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,399
whip limit uh work in progress limit I'm

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,399
going to set that to two and committee

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,560
to two but actually I just want to set

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,800
approved to h four that's my backlog

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,040
that's how many things are going to be

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,599
in my queue to do and lots of new items

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,280
we don't care about them we care about

55
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,200
what's in the approved column what's

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,319
been approved by the product orderer I

57
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,080
can just drag items into the correct

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,480
board or into the approved column you

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,879
can see that the column goes green as

60
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,239
I'm dragging the items in um I'm going

61
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,680
to put four items in there and then I

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,959
probably want to move a couple of items

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
into to my committed State and so let me

64
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,200
move create team

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,959
project and add some backlog items and

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,319
you'll

67
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:43,319
see you can see that I've met my uh work

68
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,280
in progress limit for my committed

69
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,800
column I have two of two and it's still

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,560
green if I drag try and drag another

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,599
item across you'll see it'll go red it

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,360
will actually let me break the rules it

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,800
won't enforce the rules that's okay I'm

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,840
smart enough to know that I shouldn't be

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,680
breaking them so I'm not going to move a

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
new item in I can however move an item

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,720
over to done and you'll see it goes

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
green to indicate that um if this is all

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,599
complete we're we're in the Happy Happy

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,760
State now that I have free space in my

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,280
committed column I can drag a new item

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,959
across and I'm still within the web

83
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,120
limits um so I don't get it doesn't go

84
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,720
red I don't get any warnings so these

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,920
new features are only available in TFS

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,840
preview right now you won't find them in

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,879
the RTM version of TFS or visual studio

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,400
um TFS and visual studio are both moving

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
to a tighter release schedule they're

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
releasing new features every 3 months uh

91
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,439
so you will see it on premise uh within

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,280
the next 3 months cuz we've already had

93
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:44,200
the first uh RTM shipped version of TFS

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,400
so things like the new uh cumulative

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,720
flow diagrams that you see there I don't

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,640
have any data yet but you see it there

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,599
um will be available very soon uh on the

98
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,799
