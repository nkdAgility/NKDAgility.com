It touches on the evolution and impact of these principles within organizations, highlighting a structured approach to professional conduct in Agile. However, while it mentions Agile as a discipline, it focuses heavily on specific challenges and metrics rather than a broader systemic application or governance structures within the discipline itself, slightly limiting its depth of discussion.",
