1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,620
I think I think one of my favorite

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
favorite sayings

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,799
um I don't know I don't know where I

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,940
heard it to be honest I think I've heard

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,080
it a few times from a few different

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,140
places

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,699
um but it's the that don't put down to

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,340
malevolence

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,480
what you can put down doing confidence

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,080
right

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,180
most of the time when you're working as

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,399
a as an agile coach in organizations or

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,840
a scrum master or a product owner or a

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,899
developer and people are

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,180
doing things in a way that negatively

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,140
affects your ability to do your job

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,420
right most of the time they're not doing

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,980
it because they're dicks right they're

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,800
not doing it with their dicks they're

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,079
doing it because they're measured

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,660
there's a there's there's a reason that

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,180
they're being measured in a way that

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,539
results in them making decisions that

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,519
have a negative outcome right or uh so

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,040
so somewhere in the organization there's

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,020
some level of incompetence that that

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,820
this decision has not been changed right

28
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,180
this measurement have not been changed

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,119
the old adage that hopefully nobody

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,920
still has in their organization is that

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,380
developers being measured by the number

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,479
of lines of code they write right we all

33
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,159
know that's a dumb thing to do because

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,659
especially if you're a developer because

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,100
what you do is you start copying and

36
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,500
pasting out Shakespeare into the

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,040
comments and then you end up with these

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,280
uh lots of lots of uh lots of light

39
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,960
lines of code you've written and in fact

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,880
um I've seen I've seen organizations do

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,220
the opposite as well

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,579
um the fewer lines of code

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,380
that you write right which is meant to

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,460
be somebody thought it would be a good

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,920
idea

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,659
because you want to optimize your code

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,360
as much as possible

48
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,680
but what you end up doing is you get a

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,180
bunch of people that go well it's not

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,659
raining but today then and I'll get my

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,680
bonus right so you have to you have to

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,720
people's people's behaviors

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,039
are directly related to the way you

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,480
measure

55
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,879
right

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,180
you you you think

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,700
it's the culture

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,040
right that that creates that so people

59
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,840
focus on changing the culture in an

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,440
organization but it's not the culture

61
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,879
the culture is just as the shadow on the

62
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,760
wall

63
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,560
of the measures for people reflecting

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,420
through people's activities and that's

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,459
the shadow in the wall right

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,319
so you can't you can't actually change

67
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,780
that you can't change culture you can't

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,980
affect culture change the way people are

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,019
measured

70
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,019
change the system

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,239
right and this if you change the system

72
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,800
the light will shift and the shadow will

73
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
change

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,940
so it's always a system problem it's

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,260
never actually the people are in the

76
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,480
middle

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,800
and they're just doing what the systems

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
telling them to do or the system's

79
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,879
encouraging them to do or or you know

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,319
like um

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,720
you know how sometimes you feel like

82
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,340
doing something is an uphill battle that

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,200
at every turn you're you're you're

84
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,760
sabotaged by somebody in your you know

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,500
you're trying I'm trying to ship this

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,780
product to production and you just get

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,420
sabotaged at every like oh we're gonna

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,440
be oh crap Here Comes compliance or you

89
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,180
know what whatever it is you're

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,920
sabotaged at every turn that's because

91
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,959
it's it's an uphill battle right

92
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,379
the system has created an uphill battle

93
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,300
because they don't want you to do that

94
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,220
you need to tip it the other way make it

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,200
easier

96
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,239
here's a perfect analogy for that

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,239
um why why do we have change requests

98
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,200
yes that's the way why do we have change

99
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,180
requests in in organizing you've got a

100
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,799
project you try to deliver your back

101
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,159
project and the customer comes along and

102
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,140
says our business has changed we need to

103
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,640
change what we're working on and we're

104
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,099
like well

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,379
here's the 5 000 page change request

106
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,720
form and the contract negotiation team

107
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,480
that come along with it to to help you

108
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,860
navigate this this problem and the

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,480
reason we do that is we don't want to

110
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,120
change anything because if we've got a

111
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,340
traditional project mindset you want to

112
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,160
plan out the project at the start you

113
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,220
want to minimize the variance in the

114
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,320
project and just deliver it right that's

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,540
that's we need to make 5000 widgets

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
you've placed an order for 5000 widgets

117
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,080
we're gonna make 5000 widgets and if you

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,360
come along later and say you only want

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,160
400 widgets that's tough we've already

120
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,259
committed to making 5000 you've signed

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,419
the contract right

122
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,759
that works great for factories right

123
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,100
because it protects both parties but it

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,820
totally sucks for building stuff that

125
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,820
doesn't exist yet

126
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,020
so this this this

127
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,259
malevolence that we sometimes feel

128
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,259
that is directed at us to inhibit our

129
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:04,320
ability to do stuff inhibit our ability

130
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,060
to get stuff done is is not male

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,840
elements at all it's it's the

132
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,660
incompetence of the system the system

133
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,520
has created this level of incompetence

134
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,740
in the people that results in that

135
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,620
shadow in the wall that we can't change

136
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,120
change the system always work on the

137
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,160
systems
