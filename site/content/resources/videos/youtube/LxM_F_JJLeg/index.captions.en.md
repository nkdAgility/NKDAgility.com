I think I think one of my favourite favourite sayings, um I don't know I don't know where I heard it to be honest I think I've heard it a few times from a few different places, um but it's the that don't put down to malevolence what you can put down doing confidence. 

Right, most of the time when you're working as an agile coach in organisations or a scrum master or a product owner or a developer and people are doing things in a way that negatively affects your ability to do your job, right, most of the time they're not doing it because they're dicks, right, they're not doing it with their dicks, they're doing it because they're measured. 

There's a reason that they're being measured in a way that results in them making decisions that have a negative outcome, right, or, uh, so somewhere in the organisation there's some level of incompetence that this decision has not been changed, right. This measurement has not been changed. 

The old adage that hopefully nobody still has in their organisation is that developers being measured by the number of lines of code they write, right. We all know that's a dumb thing to do because especially if you're a developer because what you do is you start copying and pasting out Shakespeare into the comments and then you end up with these, uh, lots of lots of, uh, lots of lines of code you've written. 

And in fact, um, I've seen organisations do the opposite as well. The fewer lines of code that you write, right, which is meant to be somebody thought it would be a good idea because you want to optimise your code as much as possible. 

But what you end up doing is you get a bunch of people that go, well, it's not raining but today then and I'll get my bonus, right. So you have to, you have to, people's behaviours are directly related to the way you measure, right. 

You think it's the culture, right, that creates that. So people focus on changing the culture in an organisation but it's not the culture. The culture is just as the shadow on the wall of the measures for people reflecting through people's activities and that's the shadow in the wall, right. 

So you can't, you can't actually change that. You can't change culture. Change the way people are measured. Change the system, right. And this, if you change the system, the light will shift and the shadow will change. 

So it's always a system problem. It's never actually the people are in the middle and they're just doing what the system's telling them to do or the system's encouraging them to do or, or, you know, like, um, you know how sometimes you feel like doing something is an uphill battle that at every turn you're, you're, you're sabotaged by somebody in your, you know, you're trying, I'm trying to ship this product to production and you just get sabotaged at every, like, oh, we're gonna be, oh crap, here comes compliance or, you know, whatever it is, you're sabotaged at every turn. 

That's because it's an uphill battle, right. The system has created an uphill battle because they don't want you to do that. You need to tip it the other way, make it easier. 

Here's a perfect analogy for that. Um, why, why do we have change requests? Yes, that's the way. Why do we have change requests in organising? You've got a project, you try to deliver your back project and the customer comes along and says our business has changed, we need to change what we're working on and we're like, well, here's the 5,000 page change request form and the contract negotiation team that come along with it to help you navigate this problem. 

And the reason we do that is we don't want to change anything because if we've got a traditional project mindset, you want to plan out the project at the start, you want to minimise the variance in the project and just deliver it, right. That's, we need to make 5,000 widgets. You've placed an order for 5,000 widgets. We're gonna make 5,000 widgets and if you come along later and say you only want 400 widgets, that's tough, we've already committed to making 5,000, you've signed the contract, right. 

That works great for factories, right, because it protects both parties but it totally sucks for building stuff that doesn't exist yet. 

So this, this, this malevolence that we sometimes feel that is directed at us to inhibit our ability to do stuff, inhibit our ability to get stuff done is not malevolence at all. It's the incompetence of the system. The system has created this level of incompetence in the people that results in that shadow in the wall that we can't change. 

Change the system. Always work on the systems.
