The role of the coach is mentioned as part of the solution, and several passages focus on fostering inclusion, adaptation, and team-specific needs (e.g., the story about the Scrum Master), reflecting coaching themes. The core audience (Agile practitioners, Scrum Masters, team leads) matches the Coaching category, and overall, much of the discussion orbits real-world coaching stances (meeting teams where they are, focusing on outcomes, encouraging experimentation). However, direct advice or frameworks on coaching are minimal, and dedicated discussion of coaching techniques is not present—thus, alignment and depth score highly but do not reach the maximum. Minor mention of seeking a coach, plus strong indirect alignment boosts the confidence, but mentions remain low due to the lack of explicit coaching terminology.",

The argument is primarily philosophical and value-driven (flexibility vs. dogma), not empirical. The depth is moderate since it unpacks real-world scenarios and rationale against rigid rule adherence but does not connect these directly with evidence-backed leadership practices or systematic data use. The intent appears more motivational and practical than instructional about evidence-based approaches. Audience alignment is mediocre; it addresses Agile practitioners and coaches, who may overlap with the evidence-based leadership audience, but the article doesn't presuppose familiarity with EBM concepts.
