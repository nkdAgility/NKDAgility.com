1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,839
one of the ghosts of agile past is

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,200
certification we've been hearing a lot

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,679
about it recently with uh many folks

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,039
being very I don't know H dismissive or

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:22,320
pooping on certifications a

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:26,119
lot and I want to kind of add to that

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,119
pile little bit but also um um validate

8
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,840
some of the value that we get from from

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,200
certifications

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,719
um certifications have have had a

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,000
significant impact on our industry

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,160
because they they get in the way they

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
kind of get in the way of learning a

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,960
little bit they really shouldn't get in

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,280
the way of learning but they do get in

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,280
the way of learning people get jobs

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,359
because they have certifications not be

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,039
actually able to do stuff and people

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,239
chase certifications rather than the

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,960
knowledge that is the thing that those

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,400
certifications are supposed to assess

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm going to say this now absolutely

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,000
categorically there is no 2-day course

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,840
that any of you can go on and then pass

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
a certification that will enable you to

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,880
be the thing that the certification

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,920
enabled you to pass at the very most at

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,520
the very most I think of it like passing

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,280
your driving test right at the moment

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,079
when you are 17 or whatever age it is in

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,720
your area that you passed your driving

32
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:40,479
test were you the most awesome driver

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:43,240
out there no you were not you were the

34
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,560
minimum you had the minimum information

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,200
you need to not be a danger to those

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,000
around you quite often not even that but

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,880
mostly the idea behind a driving test um

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,280
and the driving training that you get

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,520
which you don't have to do training you

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:04,920
can just sit the test um is to to that

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,640
you're not a danger a danger to others

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,039
and

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,840
does getting your driving test mean you

44
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,360
can also ride a motorbike probably not

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,400
can you drive a 10-ton truck probably

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,599
not right all of those things are

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,720
additional licenses and certifications

48
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,480
you need to get in able to in order to

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,480
do those other things and usually they

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,560
come with additional limits and

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,720
constraints as well and what I think the

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,400
value of certifications are um well the

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
certification itself if you just get

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,200
given the certification it's not

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,319
valuable the value in some kind of

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,480
assessment at the end of your course

57
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,599
regardless of whose assessment that is

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,400
uh the value of it is where you paying

59
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,080
attention to the core things that were

60
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,879
expected to be paid attention to did the

61
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,800
trainer manage to cover the core things

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,040
that we expected to be in the class did

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,159
I as a student understand the core

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,000
things um as they're intended to be in

65
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,760
the class those are the minimum bars

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,120
that we would like to meet and sometimes

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,720
things happen sometimes we don't meet

68
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,599
them and having some kind of

69
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,920
certification can help validate that

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,480
knowledge a little bit but

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,720
ultimately if you're using

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,080
certifications for job interviews or

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
you're using them for some kind of

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,480
professional Acumen

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,680
or forbid this if you've just passed a

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,439
scrum Master certification and now

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,040
you've put scrum Master on your LinkedIn

78
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,680
profile or agile coach because you've

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
passed an ICF

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,560
certification then get that off there as

81
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,799
quickly as possible unless you've got

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:01,560
the experience to back it up you are not

83
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:05,079
the thing my first scrum Master job is

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,720
not the same as being a scrum master so

85
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,879
if you're selling yourself as a scrum

86
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,480
master and you haven't even had my first

87
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,400
scrum Master Class job then that's

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,320
probably not a good idea most of the

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,960
best scrum Masters that I've met did not

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,320
go on a scrum course and become a scrum

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,039
Master they became a scrum master and

92
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,080
then they went on a scrum course and the

93
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:38,199
way they became a scrum master was the

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,320
team that they worked in selected them

95
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,520
for that role because they were the most

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,960
competent um person on the team within

97
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,320
the context of maximizing the

98
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,039
effectiveness of that team that's how

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,280
the best people become scrum Masters so

100
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:59,280
if you want to be a scrum Master my

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,080
advice would be join a team that uses

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,919
the skills that you already have and

103
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,199
demonstrate to that team that you

104
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,759
provide value and are effective and are

105
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,639
interested in their effectiveness and

106
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,919
can help them and they will select you

107
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,160
to be their scrum Master it's not really

108
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
a job

109
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,840
title

110
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:28,919
that's the certification ghost of agile

111
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,680
past if you're being haunted by these

112
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:35,560
ghosts of agile past we can help you

113
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,240
exercise them or help you find a coach

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,319
consultant or trainer who can don't let

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
these Phantoms undermine the

116
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,520
effectiveness of your value delivery the

117
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,880
longer they Linger The more they'll

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,039
haunt your team's progress um or even
