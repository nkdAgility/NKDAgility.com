  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In the world of Agile, one ghost that haunts us is dogma. If you've been in Agile long enough, you've probably encountered those dogmatic individuals who cling to a rigid set of beliefs, refusing to adapt or consider the actual data, feedback, or experiences of the people around them. These folks? They need to be shown the door üö™. Agile is about flexibility, adaptation, and collaboration‚Äîdogma has no place here.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pragmatism-vs-dogmatism-in-agile\"><strong>Pragmatism vs Dogmatism in Agile</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let's get one thing straight: while I strive to be pragmatic almost 100% of the time when working with teams, there are times when I can get a bit pedantic. And that‚Äôs usually in a training environment, where precision and clarity matter. If I'm teaching Scrum, Continuous Delivery, or any other framework or technology, I will be very specific about terminology‚Äîwhat things are called, why they are called that, and how they interact with other elements.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Why? Because it‚Äôs essential to understand the language and the principles behind what we‚Äôre learning. Whether you‚Äôre learning Scrum or mastering C#, the words we use and the definitions matter. But that precision shouldn‚Äôt bleed into dogma when we‚Äôre back in the real world working with teams. This is where we need to shift from pedantry to pragmatism.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-real-world-example-a-fired-scrum-master\"><strong>Real-World Example: A Fired Scrum Master</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let me share a story to highlight the importance of being pragmatic. A good friend and mentor of mine, Stephen Borg, once told me about a Scrum Master who got fired. Now, it‚Äôs not often you hear about Scrum Masters being let go, but in this case, the reason was their rigid, dogmatic approach.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This Scrum Master insisted that the team must stand during the daily stand-up meeting‚Äîafter all, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äústand-up,‚Äù right? But here‚Äôs the kicker: the team had a disabled member in a wheelchair. To ensure everyone was on equal footing, the team decided to sit during the stand-up. This was an act of respect and inclusion, which is fundamental to Agile. They were prioritizing openness, respect, and courage, the very values we hold dear in Scrum.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, this Scrum Master didn‚Äôt see it that way. To them, the rule was clear: stand during the stand-up or you're not doing Scrum. The result? They were fired for their inflexibility, for sticking to a dogmatic interpretation of Scrum that overlooked the true essence of Agile: adapting to the needs of the team.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Being dogmatic about processes can do more harm than good.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Flexibility is crucial in creating inclusive, respectful environments.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Agile is about the people, not just the processes. üë•</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-flexibility-in-agile\"><strong>The Importance of Flexibility in Agile</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This brings us to the heart of the matter‚Äîwhy dogma can be so damaging in Agile. Dogma is rooted in blind belief, in adhering to a set of principles or rules regardless of the evidence to the contrary. Agile, on the other hand, thrives on continuous learning, experimentation, and iteration. In the example above, the team demonstrated <em>true</em> agility by adapting their process to better suit the needs of the individuals involved. Sitting down didn‚Äôt make them any less Agile; in fact, it showed their commitment to the values that define Scrum.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you‚Äôre not adapting, you‚Äôre not Agile. If you‚Äôre following rules just for the sake of following them‚Äîwithout understanding their purpose‚Äîyou‚Äôre missing the point. And that‚Äôs where dogma rears its ugly head.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-flexibility-matters\"><strong>Why Flexibility Matters:</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Agile is all about responding to change and adapting to new information üìà.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Dogmatic approaches stifle innovation and progress.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Teams thrive when they have the autonomy to adjust processes based on their specific context.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pedantic-vs-pragmatic-approaches\"><strong>Pedantic vs Pragmatic Approaches</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now, let‚Äôs be clear: there‚Äôs a difference between being pedantic and being dogmatic. As I mentioned earlier, being pedantic‚Äîfocusing on the precise meaning of terms and frameworks‚Äîhas its place, particularly in training. It‚Äôs crucial to ensure that everyone is speaking the same language and that concepts are clearly understood.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, when it comes to working with teams in the real world, pragmatism should always win out. Every team is different, with its own set of skills, experiences, and challenges. Being a good Scrum Master or Agile coach means working within the context of the team, understanding their unique needs, and adapting accordingly. It‚Äôs about being flexible and open, not rigid and dogmatic.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pragmatic-approaches-in-agile\"><strong>Pragmatic Approaches in Agile:</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Meet teams where they are, not where you think they should be.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Focus on outcomes and value delivery, not strict adherence to rules üõ†Ô∏è.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Encourage open dialogue and experimentation to find what works best.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overcoming-the-ghosts-of-agile-past\"><strong>Overcoming the Ghosts of Agile Past</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you‚Äôre being haunted by the ghosts of Agile past‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs dogma, outdated practices, or rigid mindsets‚Äîit‚Äôs time to let go. Agile is about delivering value, continuously improving, and responding to feedback. Holding on to dogmatic principles that no longer serve the team or the product will only slow you down.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As we‚Äôve seen, dogma can undermine the effectiveness of a team and stifle its ability to deliver value. The longer it lingers, the more damage it can do. So, if you‚Äôre struggling with these Agile ghosts, it‚Äôs time to exorcise them. Whether you need a coach, a consultant, or just some advice, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion-embrace-pragmatism-reject-dogma\"><strong>Conclusion: Embrace Pragmatism, Reject Dogma</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>In Agile, we need to focus on pragmatism over dogmatism. Teams are made up of individuals with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences, and no single approach will work for everyone. Agile is about adaptability and finding the best path forward for your team, not rigidly following a set of rules.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, if you find yourself or your team stuck in dogmatic thinking, remember this: it‚Äôs not about the rules; it‚Äôs about delivering value and improving continuously. Don‚Äôt let the ghost of dogma haunt your Agile practice üëª. If you want to discuss your unique needs or situation, book a call or visit us at nakedagility.com.
