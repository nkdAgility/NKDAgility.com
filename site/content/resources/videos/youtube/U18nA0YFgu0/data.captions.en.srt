1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:12,639
one of the seven deadly sins of agile is

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,320
wrath wrath occurs in many different

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,800
forms uh in teams working in

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,240
organizations um most often it's the

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,560
inability for us to do things wrong it's

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,720
the inability for um an organization to

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,519
accept that we're not going to do things

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,399
right every time

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:38,200
Um this can kind of manifest in um a

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,920
example from Recently um we need to

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,120
working with an organization we need to

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,199
create uh some some some procedures and

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,520
practices around um doing a deployment

14
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,520
need to create procedures and practices

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,000
um and the team that I've been working

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,760
with wants to create here's here's what

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,280
we think is going to work let's try that

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,920
and then as we figure out more we can

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,799
iterate on this policy and procedure and

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,880
get it to be what we need it to be in

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
order to be able to to be successfully

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,840
in production and then we can reuse that

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,520
as we go for for future applications

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,000
right future things that we're doing uh

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,960
but the the the other side uh didn't

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,680
want to do that they wanted to uh you

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,200
you create your final draft we'll take

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,320
that we'll run it around the hundred

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,840
people that need to go see it and we'll

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,320
create a spreadsheet with all of the

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,880
things wrong with it and here's the

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,759
things wrong with it that you have to go

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:40,439
fix before we can approve it right that

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:43,560
approval process is is wrath right it's

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,759
you can't be wrong therefore the end

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,799
result needs approved before you can do

37
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,360
it because if it's approved it's now no

38
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
longer your accountability so we're not

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,759
going to blame you right so it's a blame

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,240
culture uh uh uh uh technique it's going

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,119
to run up the chain get approved and

42
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,799
then whoever's approved it at the top

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
it'll be beneath them to solve the

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,159
problem anyway so if something goes

45
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,360
wrong oh it's not the people down here's

46
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,440
fault because it was approved go up who

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,000
approved it oh the CEO approved it well

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
okay then well it was wrong whatever

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,360
right so there's no there's no

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,160
accountability it's a lack of

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,200
accountability results in Wrath uh uh

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,480
going on in in the

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,360
organization and I think this this

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,599
manifests in lots of different ways I

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
think that's the core thing but it

56
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,319
manifests in lots of different ways uh

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,599
one of them uh that I've seen happen

58
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,280
with a team uh was um I had it was

59
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,400
during a a Sprint review uh the team was

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
demonstrating their product and features

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,519
to the

62
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,280
stakeholders and um one of the

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,319
stakeholders asked the team why did you

64
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,120
build it that way right in a kind of it

65
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,519
was in a kind of accusatory tone like

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,440
why did you build it that way right that

67
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,360
kind of kind of like that and

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,680
what I would expect to happen would be

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,239
that the product owner would take

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,640
accountability for the value delivered

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,599
accountability for the value delivered

72
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
in the team and they would get out in

73
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,440
front of that and say well these are the

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,440
decisions that we made we can always go

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,200
back and change them um blah blah blah

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,080
blah blah that's taking accountability

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,080
but no that's not what they did um wrath

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,159
they passed the buck and the product

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,959
owner turned to the team and said no why

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,159
did you build it that way right and

81
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,799
that's that's not taking accountability

82
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,799
and I think wrath is a is a big reason I

83
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,480
don't want it to be my fault it needs to

84
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,319
be somebody else's fault otherwise

85
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,000
something will land on me I'll get

86
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,480
covered in the poop uh uh from the from

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,400
the mistake that happens um and I think

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,519
that lack of mistakes is a huge huge

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,680
part of that story so don't let your

90
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,519
organizational culture of

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,480
Wrath create this environment where

92
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
nobody will take

93
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,680
accountability thanks for watching the
