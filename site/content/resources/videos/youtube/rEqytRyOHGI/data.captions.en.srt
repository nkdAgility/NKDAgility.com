1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,680
you can't have spent any time in uh the

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,719
agile space without encountering people

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:13,040
doing uh some kind of special Sprints

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,759
they might be doing Sprint zeros they

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,720
might be doing refactoring sprints they

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,160
might be doing bugfix sprints they may

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,720
be doing hardening

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:27,240
Sprints whatever special type of Sprint

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,519
they're doing um it is absolutely agile

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,239
banditry and those that are doing it are

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,760
just Bandits they're not doing uh uh

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,879
good things um special

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Sprints reduce and dilute our ability to

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,440
deliver usable working product so the

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,440
whole purpose across the board the whole

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:57,000
purpose of agile practices is to

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,160
enable that visibility and connection

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,359
with the stakeholders with continuous

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,239
delivery of usable working product and

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,720
that's how we manage risk in agile in

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:13,280
the old traditional model um we managed

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,119
Risk by having a detailed plan right

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,799
that was our management of risk here's

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,759
my full detailed plan because things

25
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:23,640
aren't going to change that much this

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,759
plan will work um but in the the the

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,280
complex cognitive space that we tend to

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,360
operate in when there is more unknowns

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,040
than known

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,640
you need a different way of managing

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,079
risk and in all of agile we do that uh

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,560
by creating usable working product right

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,479
that's our that's our key uh risk

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,759
mitigator because we can't document

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,360
everything that's going to happen

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,920
because there's too many surprises so

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,759
having those uh uh uh um usable working

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,320
product mitigating that risk no special

39
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,119
Sprints is key there um and a great

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,200
example of that is a scenario that

41
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,960
happened to the to the Azure devops team

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,119
uh when they first started moving

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200
towards uh uh this agile thing they

44
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,040
actually they were kind of moving

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,200
towards this scrum thing um and they

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,920
decided

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,319
initially that they would have uh six

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,360
Sprints six 3we Sprints and then they

49
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,560
would do a a kind of hardening bug

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,440
fixing you know safety net some kind of

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,680
sa safety net Sprint I don't remember

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
specifically what they called it was

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,959
some kind of safety net Sprint and what

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,720
they expected to happen was as as each

55
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,800
Sprint H started and completed that you

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,080
would have a kind of EB and flow of

57
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,239
undone work right whatever you want to

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,440
call it h uh of undone work of technical

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,200
debt of things that weren't quite right

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,239
and they would have this little little

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,760
uptick uh and then towards the end of

62
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,000
the Sprint it would come back down again

63
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,239
and then the next Sprint would have a

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,400
little bit under and then it would come

65
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,239
back down again maybe there'd be a

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,599
little bit left over at the end of a

67
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,440
Sprint but then we'd pay it back the

68
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,319
next Sprint but because they had that

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,200
safety net and because every single

70
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:17,720
member of every single team knew that

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,920
they had that safety net they thought

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,120
constantly well I'll just leave that for

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,879
our our our safety net we'll leave that

74
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,200
for our safety net Sprint and it

75
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,319
happened so much that instead of that

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,319
kind of e and flow of undone work they

77
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,400
ended up with a nice little upward curve

78
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,720
trajectory of undone work and they got

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,959
to that sixth Sprint and realized that

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,599
they had more work that they could do in

81
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,920
the safety net to pay it back and create

82
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,319
a usable working product it wasn't

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,040
working um so what they did they

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,079
restarted uh the whole thing let's start

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,879
again and we're just going to do three

86
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,879
week Sprints and at the end of every

87
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:10,439
three week Sprint we're GNA ship to

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,920
production not a maybe we're going to so

89
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,400
we have to have good quality we have to

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,680
have paid back our technical debt we

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,600
have to have as little undone work as

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,040
possible going into the next Sprint

93
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,320
because there is no safety net people

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,880
who have safety nets take risks and if

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,600
you have a safety net that's agile

96
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,440
banditry

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,800

98
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,360
bandits in your organization then my
