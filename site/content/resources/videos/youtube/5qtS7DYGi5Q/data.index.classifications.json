There are no clear mentions of structural roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master) tied to accountability, nor discussions of accountability systems.

    "reasoning": "The content focuses almost exclusively on Evidence-Based Management (EBM) and organizational value metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction, employee engagement), but Objective Key Results (OKRs) are not directly or indirectly mentioned. There is brief discussion about 'aligning goals and outcomes' and 'clarity in goals,' but these concepts are generic and do not explicitly reference the OKR framework, its principles, or practical application. Metrics discussed do not connect to OKRs' unique outcome-based structure, nor do they mention alignment, stretch goals, or John Doerr's foundational principles. The audience overlaps with OKR practitioners but the content remains off-topic for this category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "The content is highly focused on Evidence-Based Management and value metrics, with no substantive or explicit connection to Objective Key Results as a framework, making its relevance to the OKR category very low.",
