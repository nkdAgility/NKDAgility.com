How do you know the value that is currently delivered in your organisation? Evidence-based management is a tool that will help you understand the current value in your organisation. You might use metrics, like customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, or even revenue per employee or product cost ratio. You might be looking at telemetry for your customer usage index, how much of your product is actually used in your organisation. These are all things that will enable you to make better decisions.
