1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,839
are teams empowered to change the

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:09,080
requirements based on user

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,040
feedback if not then you're probably not

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,120
very

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,400
agile we need to be engaging with the

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,519
people that are building the product and

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,480
as we understand the work better as we

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,599
understand different ways to do things

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,240
as we gain more knowledge and context

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,480
about the product and the market and

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,720
what it is we're trying to achieve we

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,719
need to be able to up update the backlog

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,640
update the requirements change them

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,000
delete them as well if we're not doing

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,000
that then we're not going to be able to

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,399
maximize the value that we deliver to

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,600
our customers and the people doing the

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,160
work the people creating the product are

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,559
really important to that story and their

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,160
input is just as important as the

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,359
stakeholders are you maximizing the

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,359
value that you deliver to your customers
