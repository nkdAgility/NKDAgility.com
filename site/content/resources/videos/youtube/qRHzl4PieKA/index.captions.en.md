Are teams empowered to change the requirements based on user feedback? If not, then you're probably not very agile. We need to be engaging with the people that are building the product, and as we understand the work better, as we understand different ways to do things, as we gain more knowledge and context about the product and the market and what it is we're trying to achieve, we need to be able to update the backlog, update the requirements, change them, delete them as well. If we're not doing that, then we're not going to be able to maximize the value that we deliver to our customers. The people doing the work, the people creating the product, are really important to that story, and their input is just as important as the stakeholders. Are you maximizing the value that you deliver to your customers?
