it and luuka it's been a

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,640
while uh

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:22,240
yeah uh I I haven't done any

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,240
courses uh in the meantime but I've

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,240
started applying uh

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:36,399
ebm on on quite regular basis yeah uh I

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,399
have some strategic

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:45,439
plannings in the next uh in the next few

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,320
few weeks so uh and I've already started

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,479
one but it's it's an iterative planning

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,079
so we're going to be we started last

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,759
month and I hope we'll finish it by the

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,759
end of this

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
one

37
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,080
ABM is the great Direction high five my

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,800
new friend yeah I like it very

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,519
much especially after Martin taught us

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,080
how to how to use the metrics ah when

41
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,080
the expert supports you now more and

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,760
more things are getting better right

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,760
yeah I think that hard the hardest part

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,560
is is picking is choosing metrics right

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,319
because

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
although ebm has a bunch of example

47
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,160
metrics they might not be quite right

48
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,080
for your org and trying to figure out

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,400
how to and get people to do it as well

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,319
it's super hard i' i' I've um I've been

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,720
using the liberators uh scrum team

52
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:57,000
survey okay and getting people to fill

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,920
it out is an absolute nightmare

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,959
really absolute nightmare I've got I've

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,959
got a I I I'm doing a a

56
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,200
psmo at the moment and it's a it's a

57
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,280
immersive

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,519
psmo and they have four teams and all

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,239
it's the the the product owners and and

60
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,480
scrum Masters that are in the training

61
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,159
and I said how about I just give you

62
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,120
three months

63
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,799
of this Liberator scrum team

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,360
survey and we're two weeks into them

65
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,799
sending out the URLs to fill it out and

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,560
there's three people on between the four

67
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,400
teams that filled it out

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,239
[Â __Â ] it's how they present it internally

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,680
and I can't see that part right if it's

70
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,840
here's the survey people I don't give a

71
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,319
[Â __Â ] right if it's if it's here's

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,360
something that can help us identify how

73
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:56,120
we can help you then it might get more

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,120
push

75
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,959
but I mean usually when I'm uh giving

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,079
out a survey of any

77
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:13,640
sort uh I tell the people who I expect

78
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:16,639
to fill it out that this this survey

79
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,280
serves what we want to achieve in this

80
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,120
this and this way and and then usually

81
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,440
they're collaborative but uh next week

82
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm starting with with a series of

83
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,800
Discovery interviews for uh for this

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,960
strategic planning which they think is

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,720
going to be a strategic planning I know

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,400
it's not going to be a strategic

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,880
planning just possibly some alignment

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,680
sessions or whatever so they uh they did

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,759

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,919

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,199
conversations um I hope that my

140
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:37,479
presentation will trigger some of your

141
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,479
questions so uh can you see my

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:48,919
screen yes no yes you stuck to me yes

143
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:52,639
wonderful so let's do it and our today's

144
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:55,120
Story start with my window why my window

145
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,080
is important because as you can see on

146
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,360
the left hand side of the slide we have

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,120
some some things happening which is

148
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,720
pretty pretty close to to uh to the flat

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,120
to the apartment where I live some

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,360
construction work is happening and when

151
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,800
I was looking through that window I I

152
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,360
realized that there are different people

153
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,400
there with different

154
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,639
helmets and those helmets will play an

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,120
important role in our today's uh today's

156
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:33,000
Journey so majority of the people have

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,519
yellow helmet Ms some of them have blue

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,240
greens uh but the people that we will

159
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,320
focus on today are the the owners of

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,560
white

161
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,279
helmets why they are

162
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,080
important well because those helmets

163
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,120
bring some important message about this

164
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,800
process so the owners of white helmets

165
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,880
are uh different kinds different levels

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:04,839
of managers

167
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:08,880
um people who inspect direct the process

168
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:13,079
and how does this process look like well

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,320
uh White uh helmet owners they uh they

170
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,959
take uh this process very strong in

171
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,800
their hands they pay attention to the

172
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,200
process every single day there are some

173
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,320
meetings in Polish we call them oprava

174
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,959
which means briefing checkin they talk

175
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:35,880
to the team they tell them what to do uh

176
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:40,680
the team focus is focusing on doing

177
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:44,360
everyday great job towards uh towards

178
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:48,720
building um next floor towards towards

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,200
building next Parts they are just um

180
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,800
following the rules there are people who

181
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,760
own the rules and in fact for that

182
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,519
special group certain mechanisms work so

183
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,240
for in instance if we will be really

184
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,200
focused and they we will be lucky not

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,079
many people will be sick most likely we

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,360
will be able to finish this current

187
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,720
floor quickly and we may get an

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,839
incentive so long story short the more

189
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,680
bricks the quicker we build the more

190
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,959
money potentially is is there on the

191
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:31,720
table so those are the tools that those

192
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:34,000
white helmets owners can can use and

193
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,000
based on some conversations that I had

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,560
in the past they might be might be very

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,120
very useful in that

196
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:48,240
context but this is just my window right

197
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,360
what is happening in the world when you

198
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,560
when you look at different places well a

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:59,079
lot of things is happening so on one

200
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,560
hand we have uh a lot of automation

201
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:07,560
robotics happening so by the way this is

202
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,880
the picture uh leftand top one from from

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,399
um the work that was uh actually I was

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,920
involved in so this is this is a robotic

205
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,880
robotic company from Poland that is

206
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,160
helping automate uh tedious repetitive

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,519
work in

208
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,320
warehouses uh a lot of Industries are

209
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:33,079
already automated to such an extent that

210
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,639
actually a lot of manual work was

211
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,959
replaced we have code we have

212
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:43,200
applications we have software products

213
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:48,320
that helped improve people's life and

214
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:52,839
they uh they made um a lot of work that

215
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,680
that is repetitive that is resembles

216
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:00,040
itself we we see some patterns that work

217
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,920
started to be uh to be replaced by

218
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,600
machines by automation but different

219
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,560
tools not to mention the AI thing that

220
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,160
is happening a lot of fantastic powerful

221
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,480
tools what does it mean for us well what

222
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:21,320
is left for for

223
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,560
humans ER brings important topic to our

224
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,920
table so this

225
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:32,800
work is a bit different we need a people

226
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,320
to be very creative to take the best

227
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,279
what the humankind brought to this world

228
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,959
so ability to create innovative

229
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,839
solutions ability to think out of the

230
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:50,360
box ability to connect certain dots that

231
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,880
maybe they haven't been connected so far

232
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,880
so what does it mean to the companies

233
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:02,560
well seems like although a lot of

234
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,880
interesting challenges are coming for uh

235
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,560
for for different experts different

236
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,440
Specialists employees are getting

237
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,720
frustrated so here you have a bunch of

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,959
data taken from different service from

239
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:24,240
uh Gallop Institute and what we can see

240
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:27,760
here well oh well only 22% of employees

241
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,399
truly trust in the leadership of their

242
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,560
organization

243
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:37,480
13% of people claim that their direct

244
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:40,480
supervisor or in general ma management

245
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,240
leadership those people are the reasons

246
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,639
why they are leaving the job if you dig

247
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,040
into the details there are more reasons

248
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,839
that are directly or

249
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,759
indirectly uh influenced by managers by

250
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,320
the

251
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:00,040
leaders so uh we also have a huge impact

252
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,279
on employees

253
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,920
engagement uh we also know

254
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,639
unfortunately that many many of the

255
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,240
companies fail they fail to uh to stay

256
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,000
in the market they fail on their Journey

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,240
uh to

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,320
succeed and seems like we have people

259
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,759
who can change those numbers because

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,000
well my personal feeling is those

261
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,040
numbers are a bit scary

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
so why we are meeting today and why we

263
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,440
believe this topic is important for many

264
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,839
of us because guess what we are not

265
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,440
robots and I can tell you as a person

266
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,160
who holds PhD in robotics yes we are not

267
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,440
the robots we are not the robots and our

268
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,680
work is now getting more and more

269
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,480
sophisticated we can offer a lot to the

270
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,800
companies and we need people people

271
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:07,639
right people to help us flourish to help

272
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:11,199
take the best out of us out of experts

273
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,440
to create fantastic company to build

274
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,880
amazing

275
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,680
products fun

276
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,079
fact yesterday um one of the biggest if

277
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,839
not the biggest ad conferences in Poland

278
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,360
ended I had a pleasure to

279
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,319
participate in that conference I had my

280
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
own Workshop

281
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,279
and you know what is one of the most

282
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,399
important

283
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,800
findings some people were missing in

284
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,680
that conference we have plenty of scrum

285
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:47,680
Masters agile coaches uh some product

286
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:52,279
owners product managers but the people

287
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,160
that we should start focus on and have a

288
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,240
great collaboration with them they were

289
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:04,399
missing so we are speaking about manager

290
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:07,839
leaders directors and so on so with that

291
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,880
uh we would love would love to uh to

292
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,199
advertise like there are people most

293
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,480
likely uh around you in your

294
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,480
organization that can influence the

295
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,839
organization can help create right

296
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,360
environment and the numbers that we just

297
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,319
went through they are telling us

298
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,199
directly there is a huge opportunity for

299
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,600
improvements

300
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:38,720
there

301
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,759
so seems like a lot of things changed

302
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,279
and although some of the people still

303
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,360
wear white

304
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:49,920
helmets a lot of managers should forget

305
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,360
about the helmet and replace it replace

306
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,920
it with true agile

307
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,399
leadership what does it mean for for the

308
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:03,160
company for the people

309
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:07,240
uh well the tools techniques that our

310
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,919
white white helmet holders uh use we

311
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,160
should change them we should

312
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,919
adapt uh we are going to help people go

313
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,600
through a challenging Journey we are

314
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:23,799
going to show them direction we are

315
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,679
going to lead by example and help them

316
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:29,679
make more

317
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,520
decisions use this fantastic parts that

318
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,120
they bring into the

319
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,799
company if you don't believe me

320
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,000
fantastic don't do that let's take a

321
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,080
look at data let's like take a look at

322
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,520
experts so pretty already I would say

323
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,400
pretty old book by Daniel Daniel pink so

324
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:54,480
drive the surprising truth what truly

325
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,080
motivates us give us very short three

326
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,559
answers to that questions and this is

327
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,039
fantastic book if you haven't had a

328
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:04,520
chance to read I strongly recommend

329
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:08,320
because it's not based on what the

330
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:13,000
author thinks it's based on the research

331
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:16,760
so we have our answer autonomy Mastery

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,120
and purpose this is what truly motivates

333
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:26,320
us if the companies want to benefit from

334
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,280
hiring amazing talents if they want to

335
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,400
uh retain those great talents

336
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,280
they need to to go back to basics and

337
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:41,720
understand how to create this

338
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:45,880
environment so what do our teams need

339
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,880
well we have uh here uh we have here an

340
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,640
idea so if we

341
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,640
compare autonomy Master autonomy master

342
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:01,159
and purpose from Daniel pink we have

343
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,679
clear boundaries that will help us in

344
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:07,200
self-management support to grow because

345
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,559
we want to become a learning

346
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,799
organization and it's not just a

347
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:17,559
buzzword it's about right conditions for

348
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:21,440
creating hypothesis for conducting

349
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:24,080
experiments and for recognizing that a

350
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,679
lot of those experiments will end up

351
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,120
with this is not the right direction for

352
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:34,799
us we need to remember that learning is

353
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,000
a journey on a very bumpy road this is

354
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,360
the truly learning

355
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,120
organization not just waiting for always

356
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,520
amazing results how we are supposed to

357
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,919
create amazing results in in a very

358
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,360
complex

359
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,559
environment we need a purpose so this is

360
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,720
extremely important motivational

361
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:01,919
aspect what do the leaders managers can

362
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,000
or should do they should provide

363
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,280
Direction so they can help to create

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,360
company Mission Vision make sure that

365
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,440
the teams understand their goals and

366
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,280
their goals are consistent with

367
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,440
company's mission and vision so if you

368
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,360
ask someone uh who is just you know

369
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,880
cleaning the floor in let's say uh

370
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,720
robotic company why your your work is

371
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,799
Meaningful why why is it important

372
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,799
you want to hear I'm enabling a lot of

373
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,799
companies for instance logistic

374
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:44,159
companies to automate tedious repetitive

375
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:46,919
work right so understanding that my job

376
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,320
matters and I'm doing important stuff

377
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,400
for others not only for myself but also

378
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,720
seeing the value that we are bringing

379
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,200
seeing this

380
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,880
customer uh and what what we are

381
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,120
actually doing to change their lives

382
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,440
this is also very very important and can

383
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:11,120
build amazing

384
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,240
motivation so uh a quick a quick test

385
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,400
for you or maybe a quick question who's

386
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,400
your favorite Barista do you prefer a

387
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:25,000
smiling committed person uh willing to

388
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:29,080
chat willing to support or rather um

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,279
grumpy head trying to discourage you

390
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,279
from ordering

391
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:43,200
coffee I guess that you would love to

392
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:46,799
rather avoid a cat and have a nice kind

393
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,600
supportive person you will be most

394
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,240
likely going back to the company where

395
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,640
you believe people care about you about

396
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,279
your problems about delivering solutions

397
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,200
for you and this is a powerful

398
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,919
difference that can make a really

399
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,679
competitive huge change in your

400
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,559
company show the people help them

401
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,120
understand that their work is important

402
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,720
is Meaningful and help uh help them help

403
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,760
them be a part of what is what is

404
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,840
happening that that commitment and they

405
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,720
they great motivation can bring the huge

406
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,679
difference so what is one of the best

407
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,799
things when what what I see and actually

408
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,120
it happened to me recently uh I was in

409
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,240
the pop everyone was drinking a beer and

410
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:44,640
I had a stomach ache and I really really

411
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,559
needed mint tea so I asked the waiter uh

412
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,080
could you please uh could you please

413
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,440
make a mint tea for me he does not have

414
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,080
any proper uh any proper tools and uh

415
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,840
ingredients prepared for that but

416
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:04,279
instead of telling me qu qu qu qu qua

417
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:08,000
it's a pop qu qu Qua we don't have mint

418
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:11,000
tea qu qu qu he decided to tell to tell

419
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
me I will figure it out and I will find

420
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
a

421
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,120
way and in a five minutes he's coming

422
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,080
back and instead of using mintty leaves

423
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,679
for for uh moito he created a really

424
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:30,760
nice tea for me and this is the example

425
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,799
of ego Behavior so instead of blindly uh

426
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:37,400
blindly following rules that are

427
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:39,400
actually um actually protecting you from

428
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,400
making the best possible

429
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,080
decisions you interpret the rules you

430
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,039
think about what you actually can do and

431
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,720
you find the solution and I would go

432
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:55,000
back to that pop because I love such

433
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,919
people last but not least important

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,240
Point why we need agile leaders because

435
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:04,880
even if we speak about agile

436
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,320
transformation seems like in some of the

437
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,039
environments people are even tired of

438
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,919
listening to Agile agile

439
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:13,880
transformation let's

440
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,200
transform think about it even

441
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,400
differently forget about the wording

442
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,600
what we want to do we want to deliver

443
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,159
valuable products we want to create

444
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,600
happy teams committed teams that will uh

445
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:32,679
will uh make customers happy happy with

446
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:35,559
our uh with our product if we just stick

447
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:38,679
to here is Scrum Master here is product

448
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,600
owner here's your team do your job uh

449
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,960
this is another team do your job that

450
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,600
will be fine most likely we will land in

451
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,480
so-called local

452
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,320
Optimum we need to work

453
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,159
together and this includes great

454
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,159
collaboration with Leaders with managers

455
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:03,679
to find global Optimum so that we can

456
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,159
maximize the value of the whole company

457
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,000
working

458
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:12,240
together the challenging part because um

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,799
I don't want to make a wrong impression

460
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,399
that it's yes it's simple yes let's do

461
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:23,720
it it's very difficult to sing the right

462
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,799
song uh so let it go and forget about

463
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,880
the white

464
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:32,320
helmet um however we believe it is

465
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:36,520
possible um and we are happy to to help

leaders

469

managers so with

470
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,679
that I'm happy to start questions Q&A

471
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,360

amazing so do we have any

475
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,039

ourselves Luca what's your

477
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:33,640
experience of uh

478

um trying to talk to leadership about

479
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,880
agility uh first uh Yanna and I hope

480
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,000
that I'm going to pronounce it corre

481
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,000
correctly

482
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,799
dardo for the presentation thank you I

483
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,399
spent some lovely time in Poland yeah

eating perogi

485
00:26:51,399 --> 00:27:01,320
mostly uh uh yeah that uh what you asked

486
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:06,520
me is what I wanted to ask uh how how to

487
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:10,080
get into their heads because uh the uh

488
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,120
the best the best slide uh was the Let

489
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,799
It Go and the white

490
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:21,640
helmet because they what's my experience

491
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:25,080
is they would like both they'd like

492
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,039
agility and to remain in

493
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,320
control uh so uh

494
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:37,279
just earlier today I um uh I had this

495
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:41,000
conver I had this conversation and

496
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:46,399
uh I Tred to convey the the

497
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:48,600
message uh that uh what we want to

498
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,640
build uh

499
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,120
in in in this transformation is a

500
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,640
support structure and you had something

501
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,960
like that also in in your in your

502
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,600
presentation so that that was like I

503
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,320
felt validated a lot uh I was like you

504
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,120
know uh when you when you grow

505
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,039
tomatoes and then you can put a net or a

506
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,320
stick uh that they use to yeah to grow

507
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,120
and I was like so that's what we are

508
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:23,640
going that's what we're trying to do and

509
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:27,120
uh the manager is like but yeah then but

510
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:30,120
then we can't steer the the the process

511
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,240
and like well do you want to steer in

512
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,120
the process for the rest of your life or

513
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,240
you want to build something that's

514
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,840
sustainable and uh that can let you go

515
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:47,720
and have at least two weeks of vacation

516
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:51,240
exactly yes every year yes that's a very

517
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,919
valid point so uh I used to work very

518
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,240
closely to to some of the sea level

519
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,960
groups because the companies were were

520
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,519
willing to help me see the word through

521
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,760
their eyes so um I can tell you that

522
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,480
what helps me is that rephrasing what

523
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,240
you said so instead of thinking like

524
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,720
they want control there is some

525
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,760
something else underlying reason and

526
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,600
what I've learned is uh trust issues no

527
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,000
coincidence in the scrum guide we are

528
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,519
saying directly about trust so this is

529
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,919
something that is very typical H there

530
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:34,279
are also some sometimes old habits or

531
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:36,880
lack of proper training tools so I

532
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:40,600
recall a company where the majority of

533
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,880
experts were trained using great

534
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:48,200
trainings having mentors and so on and

535
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,480
when I realized that uh all top

536
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,000
management and middle uh middle leaders

537
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,840
middle level leaders they have never

538
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,679
attended any course on leadership

539
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,679
some of the things you know became clear

540
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:08,919
so they haven't had a chance to see

541
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:13,600
things through different perspective so

542
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:16,880
um what what really works for me is to

543
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,640
to gain a trust in the collaboration and

544
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,600
asking them what are your worries when

545
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,679
you wake up in the morning before you

546
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,880
start work what are the first questions

547
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:31,840
that you set right and for instance they

548
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:35,320
care um startup issue uh we have

549
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,279
sponsors and they are asking questions

550
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,440
they demand results and we need to show

551
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,720
something otherwise we will lose money

552
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,760
so having this conversation with them

553
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,960
was was very helpful when we we started

554
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,840
to uh to talk about their problems

555
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,720
directly and in fact we introduced in

556
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,960
that

557
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,080
company well to a pretty high level

558
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,840
radical Candor so they've learned to

559
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,360
talk to the teams like hey this is the

560
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,919
situation if we are too pushy we are

561
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,360
sorry but this is the problem that we

562
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,519
are currently handling so when CEO for

563
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
instance organized and I helped to

564
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,559
facilitate lean coffee with employees

565
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,080
from different parts of the company that

566
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,639
helped him a lot to to have this

567
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,200
openness trust and they together were

568
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,480
working on Solutions so when you have

569
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,159
committed people you're you're typically

570
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,080
hiring smart people right and they

571
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,880
understand why you are worried it opens

572
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,120
a door to a completely different level

573
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,120
of

574
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,760
conversations yeah right you have to be

575
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,720
aware that especially when it comes to

576
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,799
top

577
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,480
management they are worried about money

578
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,200
and not because they are dragons that I

579
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,080
want to have give me more gold right uh

580
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,240
but because they care that this money is

581
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,399
needed to run the company they want to

582
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,960
pay salaries to their

583
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:12,880
employees

584
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:16,880
yeah yeah that that's true uh also

585
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,840
another problem I encountered was uh the

586
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,919
shop floor wants wants the

587
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,080
changes and the sea level wants the

588
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,559
changes but then there's middle

589
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,120
management ah I see and see that's also

590
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,720
and then so it it's

591
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,200
basically

592
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,240
um I always tell them okay you're

593
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,639
thinking of agility that's great you

594
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,960
want to go to a transformation that's

595
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,600
great it takes a lot of time and it

596
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,760
takes a lot of money so if you're not

597
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:55,120
sure don't do it because it's better not

598
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:59,360
to do it than to do it halfway and then

599
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,720
resent it for for a long

600
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:07,600
time and that's that's where they but uh

601
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,880
I'm I'm trying to I I like this example

602
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,799
of yours with With The Lean coffee

603
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,799
because I'm now I'm come coming to

604
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,000
conclusion that I have to find some

605
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:22,159
strategies to to open to open the

606
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,200
discussion and to give

607
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:30,559
them uh uh to give them some space and

608
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,279
time in which they can uh to give them

609
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:38,600
the support structure so that they could

610
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:42,840
uh get the the get to the conclusion on

611
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,279
their own yeah yeah thank you thank you

612
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,559
for sharing so I I I heard somebody

613
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:51,600
recently refer to that middle management

614
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,519
as the Perma

615
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,039
Frost right that that that kind of solid

616
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,480
layer you're trying to get to The Good

617
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,840
Earth underneath

618
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,480
from leadership and you're you're you're

619
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,240
stuck chipping away at the permafrost

620
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,799
trying to get the message through yeah

621
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
it's very

622
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,399
difficult yeah so by the way that is one

623
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,800
of the reasons why uh pal e course which

624
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,760
by the way we have in our offering is

625
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,079
advertised for Middle managers we' have

626
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,200
seen as the whole a community that uh

627
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,800
top management at least from time to

628
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,760
time they are attending some s they are

629
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,000
talking to each other and they got

630
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,119
inspired by ideas right so it might be

631
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,399
that even the Need For Change might be

632
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,919
even coming from them the teams when

633
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,079
hear them wow but middle managers got

634
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,560
lost especially when they are not

635
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,159
trained they feel

636
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,639
like we are useless right sometimes I'm

637
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,399
the person you know telling that

638
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,960
directly that I I felt useless once

639
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,280
right because this is what we see they

640
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,880
they feel uncomfortable and we help them

641
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,480
find the way because they are needed top

642
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:09,040
management can not do everything and

643
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,520
people still need great supportive

644
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,599
leaders it's the art to understand how

645
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,599
to do it

646
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,240
properly I think they quite often feel

647
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,119
sidelined yeah there's all these things

648
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,720
going on and the people on the ground

649
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,920
seem to understand it and the people up

650
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,920
here seem to understand they're asking

651
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,560
for the same things and I'm in the

652
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,640
middle going I don't know what this [Â __Â ]

653
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,520
is right and that's that's that can be

654
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,440
really difficult cuz nobody's taken the

655
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,720
time to to explain it to them nobody's

656
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,079
taken the time to to sit with them and

657
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:42,040
say this is why your job's not going

658
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,000
away this is the transition that you

659
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,599
want to make in order to enable I it's

660
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,319
going to be I think it's actually a

661
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:53,839
really interesting time because there's

662
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:57,440
not just the agile story now that's

663
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,920
putting middle management in danger

664
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,280
right because you you you might need 20

665
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:07,280
managers but do you need 20 leaders

666
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,480
right that's that's right and now ai is

667
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,800
coming along and taking away a lot of

668
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,480
the rot work from behind the scenes and

669
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,800
going well each individual person can

670
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,640
now be 60% more productive because they

671
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,200
don't have to do all of this manual

672
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,400
stuff anymore um and and it's they're

673
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,240
worried about their job security they're

674
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,160
worried about their ability to to to do

675
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:40,760
stuff I I had I I had an activity

676
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:44,359
yesterday that I had a list of um H

677
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:48,160
letters and countries associated with

678
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:51,960
letters um but in my in

679
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,920
my business we use Le you know like

680
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,720
letters for different grades of costs

681
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,760
plus currency and plus country code not

682
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,560
country name so I just fed that data

683
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,680
into chat

684
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,680
GTP and said can you switch this to

685
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,359
country code awesome can you apply these

686
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:17,839
currency rules to it awesome can you and

687
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,720
literally 20 20 less 20 less minutes I

688
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,800
was able to have all of the data

689
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,680
massaged into the format I need with all

690
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,839
of the information I needed looked up

691
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,319
and associated with it and that was like

692
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,440
good 4-Hour task if I had to do it

693
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,880
manually so those are the types of

694
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,839
things I don't know if you've noticed

695
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,280
but lots of middle managers are sitting

696
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,720
with their spreadsheets and filling out

697
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,040
their spreadsheets and editing their

698
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,440
spreadsheets and updating their

699
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,119
spreadsheets and joining this

700
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,119
spreadsheet with this other spreadsheet

701
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:55,760
so they get this data out and it that

702
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:57,680
stuff is all gone not yet it's it's what

703
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,079
would you call it it's it's it's it's

704
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,440
dead work walking right it's it's dead

705
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:07,640
just not everybody's CAU on to how dead

706
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,680
it is and it's going to be a really

707
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,280
interesting time for

708
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,400
organizations

709
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,400
um because what do they get all these

710
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,240
folks to

711
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,440
do that are that are that are there in

712
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,440
those in those in those

713
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,800
positions going to be

714
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,960
interesting there is a space to do

715
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,560
different things right but again

716
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,880
learning organizations organization is

717
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:37,359
learning and individuals are learning

718
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,359
right teams are learning Microsoft um

719
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,240
when Microsoft made a lot of changes in

720
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:46,599
that middle management

721
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,480
space they enabled people who had been

722
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,040
managers for a while you know that

723
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,240
expression that people are promoted to

724
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,400
their level of

725
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,640
incompetence yeah it it's it's not even

726
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,599
a pretend thing it's actually what

727
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,400
happens because people are seen as doing

728
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,560
a good job so they get promoted and they

729
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,119
keep getting promoted until they're seen

730
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,880
as not doing a good job anymore and then

731
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,920
that's where they stay so that they're

732
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,560
no long they should be one level below

733
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,079
right or two levels below cuz that's

734
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,760
where they're actually continuing to add

735
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,359
value um and Microsoft

736
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,520
offers anybody who's in a position to go

737
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,160
do the work of the position below for

738
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,079
the same pay as the position they were

739
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,920
promoted into

740
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,440
um in order to allow people to excel at

741
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,280
something

742
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,440
while you know we they've been given

743
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,520
that pay rise and then you can't just

744
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,400
take it away cuz that's that's bad and

745
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,920
lots of people when they moved to Agile

746
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,040
engineering teams lots of people in

747
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,680
leadership positions moved back down to

748
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,040
being Engineers working on teams helping

749
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,960
with the architecture doing much more

750
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,839
technical things

751
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,000
but they'd been previously promoted to

752
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:02,599
much higher levels of of of of

753
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,720
leadership position and I think it's

754
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:08,400
important to have a story around that as

755
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,240
an organization you need to have that

756
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,119
conversation because it's not going to

757
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,560
be a good idea globally just to get rid

758
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,160
of all the people you don't need right

759
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,520
all of these people being dumped onto

760
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,280
the market and we're going to have other

761
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,560
problems out of that yeah yeah indeed

762
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,760
and please remember this is another rule

763
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,880
that I share with managers and leaders

764
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,520
uh how you treat your ex employees or

765
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,560
employees that you are going to say

766
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,359
goodbye to this is actually a very

767
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,800
important feedback to your current

768
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,400
employees what kind of thoughts will you

769
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,560
trigger if you're just okay we have a

770
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,240
problem let's just fire people right

771
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,640
maybe there is a place uh for certain

772
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,520
movements and I I also been in that

773
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,960
situation with one of the managers after

774
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,119
a work of our collaboration

775
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,240
I talk talked to him and he said like

776
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,920
it's an amazing opportunity but I'm not

777
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,160
ready and the company did a great

778
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,480
decision they they allowed that

779
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,680
transition smoothly back now he's a

780
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,720
fantastic senior engineer in the team

781
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,079
and he's happy the team is Happy company

782
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,640
is happy because they did not uh lost a

783
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,640
talented

784
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,800
person so Mona I've seen your message in

785
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,599
the

786
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,760
chat however I'm curious would you like

787
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,880
to comment that is there a question

788
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,079
regarding

789
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,680
that I guess it's kind of like how do

790
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,240
you take them on the

791
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,599
journey

792
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,680
um you know I guess I've come from an

793
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,440
environment where everything is about

794
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,000
money you know every dollar counts and

795
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,079
you got a report against every

796
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,200
dollar and then come in somewhere where

797
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,880
it's a completely different and and it's

798
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,400
like you know they some places have done

799
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,920
like no product development for years

800
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,319
and it's okay and we've lost money and

801
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,839
it's

802
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,040
okay um and there's just not that

803
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,880
emphasis and drive

804
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,040
and there's just no alignment like as

805
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,880
soon as the word agil come in obviously

806
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,680
they've just gone don't need anything

807
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,040
and like they even questioning like why

808
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,160
I'm here just like

809
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,640
really um so yeah it's a bit difficult

810
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,960
so it's kind of trying to take them

811
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,800
through the Journey and going you know

812
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,800
these are the fundamentals these are the

813
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:37,000
basics and this is the only way you're

814
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,000
going to kind of Survive and Thrive and

815
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,800
grow I I I I I wanted to add something I

816
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,839
would suggest that you never mention the

817
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,720
words agile or scrum or any of those

818
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:54,720
things at all in your conversations

819
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:58,160
ever um it it it's while we understand

820
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,160
the theory

821
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,000
is like I might talk about

822
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,680
empiricism right because that's a

823
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,640
fundamental but the tools on top of that

824
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:12,200
are largely Irrelevant for for for for

825
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,520
these folks and they don't understand

826
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,800
what they are it's easy to explain

827
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,520
empiricism right it's easy to explain

828
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,400
but as soon as you mention any word from

829
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,760
scrum you've now got a 4-Hour

830
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,839
conversation to explain scrum so try and

831
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,960
avoid that terminology even loaded terms

832
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,640
I trying to avoid like product owner I

833
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,920
say product management right don't say

834
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,480
scrum master I say lead or um you know

835
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,680
some some depending on what how your

836
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,839
organizational structure the one of the

837
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,960
customers I'm in right now you're you're

838
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,440
either you're either a a lead or you're

839
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,720
a product manager or you're a team

840
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,480
member that's that's it squads and it's

841
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,520
squads not teams right yeah same here so

842
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,800
you use use their lexicon that comes

843
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,680
from Spotify spotify's fault

844
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,240
right use use yeah use use their

845
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,200
lexicon but in

846
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,680
introduce the fundamental theories right

847
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,800
because then they'll build their own

848
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,680
stories on top of it and maybe scrum

849
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,240
will fit or maybe something for magu

850
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,640
will fit maybe this but that's that's a

851
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,680
story for another day so I I I talk

852
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,280
about

853
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,800
empiricism right if asked right

854
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,920
empiricism I ask this all the time how

855
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,319
you measuring that yeah I it all the

856
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,839
time and also um qu questions how are

857
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,599
you measuring that um what are you going

858
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,760
to do with that data when they when they

859
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,720
say they're going to measure something

860
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,559
oh we want to add this field to this

861
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,599
thing what are you going to do with that

862
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,400
data what decisions are you going to

863
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,839
make differently with this data who's

864
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,920
going to look at and I've been in

865
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,720
conversations where no like they want to

866
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,800
add this metric to the system that's

867
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,920
going to impact on everybody using the

868
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,720
system that they have to fill it

869
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,480
out and they've get no answer to the

870
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,599
question of how they're going to use the

871
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,000
data and what they're going to know what

872
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,240
they're going to do differently based on

873
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,559
the results of that

874
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,960
data they're not thinking empirically

875
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,280
right empiricism is fundamentally

876
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,599
scientific they're not thinking about

877
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,640
why ask those

878
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,599
questions that's that's that's why

879
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,200
you're there right that's why um you're

880
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:32,119
you're you're you're in that position

881
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,640
and it it we shouldn't have to be there

882
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:35,280
right there should be no such thing as

883
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,160
an agile Co I think I wrote a blog post

884
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,680
ages ago that that agile coaches show a

885
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,520
systemic lack of leadership in your

886
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,559
organization you shouldn't need agile

887
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,160
coaches leaders should just

888
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:52,000
be the agile coaches that's that's who

889
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:55,280
it should be um

890
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,720
so I always try and think about not

891
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:01,880
being a crutch and being an

892
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:05,480
enabler yeah and have you guys faced

893
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,680
scenarios again I think it because it's

894
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,599
very new and obviously some people have

895
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,839
had some training around like product Le

896
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,520
and it's now like any decision is down

897
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,640
to product and everyone else is kind of

898
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
stepped back and I'm like no no no

899
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,760
you're just creating more silos now you

900
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,079
still have to collaborate and talk and

901
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,240
make decisions just because it's product

902
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,920
L doesn't mean they make all the

903
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,920
decisions yeah and I think again this is

904
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,160
a language thing that's kind of stuck

905
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,960
without understanding what it actually

906
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,480
means so how would you try and take

907
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,680
that I I tell people nobody cares about

908
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,680
their

909
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,720
goals the only way you get people to

910
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,000
care about your goals is you make it

911
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,520
their goals too and that doesn't mean

912
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,280
just telling them they have to buy it

913
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,200
they have to buy into it they have to

914
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,800
feel like it's their goal they have to

915
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,760
own they have to like I care about this

916
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,839
outcome if they don't care they don't

917
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,920
give a [Â __Â ] about your goals you know

918
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,319
not going to get

919
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,960
anywhere and that that's super hard

920
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:05,599
that's effectively marketing and sales

921
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,319
skills right for those people to sell

922
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,240
their goals their Direction their

923
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:12,400
strategy to other people it's not good

924
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,760
enough to be a boss anymore it just

925
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,760
doesn't

926
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,400
work sorry I stepped on that one Joan

927
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,119
you probably no no problem at all and

928
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,839
actually Mona I believe uh based on what

929
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,880
you said that you have a very powerful

930
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:34,079
tool option available because if your

931
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,880
company cares about money so um Martin

932
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,760
emphasized like why do you need what

933
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,440
you're going to do you may do something

934
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,119
uh

935
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,960
complementary calculate the cost of

936
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,280
doing that and ask how much value do you

937
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,640
believe you will get out of it this is

938
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,720
the strategy that helped me uh help me

939
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:58,160
prevent some of the changes in uh

940
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,839
people/ Finance processes uh because

941
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,720
they were claiming it's only 15 minutes

942
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:08,760
a week for every single specialist so I

943
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:11,040
just open you know uh the Excel sheet

944
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:14,240
years ago maybe today I will ask Chad

945
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:18,559
GPT for support but I did the math and I

946
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:21,079
told them okay this only 15 minutes will

947
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,800
cost you this and this amount of money

948
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:25,000
roughly

949
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,839
currently what kind of value do you

950
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,559
expect and what uh what was the fun fact

951
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:35,079
I became a product owner of a small

952
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:38,280
internal product because I offered them

953
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:41,920
that we can automate that it this will

954
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,040
this is my forecast I have a clear goal

955
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,520
I need a support of one or two engineers

956
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:51,119
in two weeks you will have a solution

957
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,359
automatically no longer asking people

958
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,319
and out of the sudden when we started

959
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:59,839
talking money it was uh conversation

960
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,880
with uh C Level

961
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,880
leadership wasn't easy but they agreed

962
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,000
that actually I care about company's

963
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,000
money and that's good

964
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:16,400
right I also think that that um having

965
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:18,119
the conversation about risks and risk

966
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,119
mitigation is something that is real

967
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:23,359
powerful when talking to management

968
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,240
and scrum in

969
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:28,280
itself tackles Risk by doing this

970
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,319
incremental right incremental we do

971
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,319
something well build what is it build

972
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:39,160
measure Val U can't remember now

973
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,720
but thank you thank you yeah uh so I

974
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:44,520
actually had this conversation with one

975
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,839
of the leaders on why we're doing this

976
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:50,520
and trying

977
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,079
to I've been been saying this me for

978
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,160
months now to to the same we have to

979
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,040
start

980
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,839
doing we can't can't plan ourself of

981
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,599
this the pickle we're in right now we

982
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:03,040
have to start doing stuff because uh and

983
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,480
that's empirism right we have to start

984
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,680
doing and start start learning but

985
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,559
there's also risk risk mitigation there

986
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,119
that we actually know what we're talking

987
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:15,839
about we get that

988
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:17,400
data about forecasting out uh products

989
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:20,640
how when we will done with the products

990
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,440
when will this and that be done so that

991
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,920
that's

992
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,559
and that conversation you can take the

993
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,400
risk conversation all the way from team

994
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:31,640
right up to to the CEO right everyone

995
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:34,799
knows about risk they have different

996
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,760
risk uh lenses on and but you can have

997
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:39,200
that risk the risk discussion with the

998
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,040
CFO right we're having a risk of losing

999
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,280
this much money then the CFO will listen

1000
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,720
to

1001
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,839
you so that that's that's something that

1002
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,760
you can carry all along up the

1003
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:50,040
organization if you ask me yeah and

1004
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,319
that's the one person I've managed to

1005
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:57,440
bring on board ah there that's a good

1006
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,440
start to yeah stop the win so far

1007
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:05,520
yeah so do you you can you do you have

1008
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,839
any like tips on okay when you have to

1009
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,440
talk to manager risk is one thing right

1010
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:14,079
are there any other areas that we can

1011
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,559
kind of lean into to make them to make

1012
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,160
them care as Martin say to make them

1013
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,160
care about

1014
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:24,440
this um what helps me is also uh showing

1015
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,880
them that we are making a lot of

1016
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,960
assumptions and there are a lot of

1017
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,480
ambiguities and this is the part of

1018
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,760
complexity right so how how will you get

1019
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,680
the answer in the complex world you have

1020
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:40,880
to you have to try how to

1021
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:44,000
try formulate an hypothesis run an

1022
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,960
experiment so that that was also

1023
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,040
something that uh I love including right

1024
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,799
risks is a one powerful tool think about

1025
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,440
what are the assumptions and I believe

1026
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:58,599
we take you might even try to have this

1027
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,400
conversation with your beloved ones try

1028
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,400
to understand how often we are making

1029
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,520
assumptions based on our

1030
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,720
beliefs how do you know yna that someone

1031
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,640
would love to read that blog post uh

1032
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,960
because it's interesting do you have

1033
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,000
data do you believe that there are no

1034
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:21,440
already great blog posts about

1035
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,839
that okay right you see we are making a

1036
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,960
lot of a lot of assumptions and we have

1037
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:29,079
a lot of beliefs in our backpacks it's

1038
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,920
good to make it clear what kind of

1039
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,920
assumptions are we

1040
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,960
taking I like

1041
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:45,040
that okay any more

1042
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:52,200

you since you're polish is uh zova and

1051
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:34,119
p uh I see and why ZKA many people like

1052
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:37,240
jka uh uh it tricked me or I was tricked

1053
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:40,839
into drinking too too much of

1054
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,240
it I see I see you know good things are

1055
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:48,240
addictive yes yes I can imagine never

1056
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,920
more basically uh but yeah thank you

1057
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,839
this was uh this was really uh this was

1058
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:56,520
really great and uh and inspiring and as

1059
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,400
I told told you

1060
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:03,720
already uh it helped me in a sense that

1061
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,079
it validated uh uh some conclusions or

1062
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:10,640
hypothesis that that I came to uh

1063
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:14,599
earlier uh on on my own so uh I'm I'm

1064
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:18,760
looking forward to uh to applying it and

1065
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:18,760
then measuring the success of

1066
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:27,240
course and yeah uh I I like uh I like

1067
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:29,599
Martin what you said about uh mirroring

1068
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,079
it's it's basically a coaching technique

1069
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:37,440
isn't it you mirror their uh their

1070
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,880
wording um you speak to speak on to

1071
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,640
speak on their own

1072
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:47,319
terms uh and not to not force uh not to

1073
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:51,559
force our uh technical terms uh on them

1074
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:56,799
and I'd say it it can be uh one of the

1075
00:54:51,559 --> 00:55:00,119
one of the strategies to um uh to

1076
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,280
boost the success of communication with

1077
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:04,280
the

1078
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,799
management yeah

1079
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,160
indeed I can tell you shortly another

1080
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:14,400
story so there was a group of people

1081
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:17,079
that were hating scrum and agile so what

1082
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,839
my colleague did instead if instead of

1083
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:24,359
as Martin proposed telling teaching

1084
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:26,599
about scrum uh she asked the team after

1085
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:28,359
two weeks of work three weeks of work

1086
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:30,960
would you like to hear the feedback

1087
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:34,680
would you like to to understand from the

1088
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,960
users yes yes so are we inviting them

1089
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,039
and we will show them the product yes

1090
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,400
yes let's do that do that so

1091
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:44,359
stakeholders came they were talking

1092
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,440
about the product they gave the feedback

1093
00:55:44,359 --> 00:55:51,039
and you know what that was proper Sprint

1094
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:53,720
review without even connecting it with

1095
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:56,359
scrum and agile and they were happy

1096
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,880
because the stakeholders said we love

1097
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:01,319
that part something is strange here we

1098
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,440
don't understand that and the team was

1099
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:08,119
amazed and here you

1100
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:10,160
go Sprint review without Sprint review

1101
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:14,720
probably better review than a lot of

1102
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,720
teams have exactly yeah

1103
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,000
absolutely proper wording right yeah

1104
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:21,960
then you can just say would you like to

1105
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,680
do that again in a couple of

1106
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,839
weeks yes let's do it and they did they

1107
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,920
they are they are just meeting with

1108
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,720
people interested in the product this is

1109
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,640
the

1110
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:38,520
name so what was the outcome of what was

1111
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,200
the outcome of this uh of these uh these

1112
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:44,640
sneaky little Sprint views that you put

1113
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:46,440
in there uh sneaky yeah sneaking in the

1114
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,559
Sprint views uh I mean uh was the

1115
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,000
customer happy uh was the team more

1116
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:55,720
happy yes yeah because team uh you know

1117
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,440
whenever you show the team that someone

1118
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:01,520
cares about their their outcomes you may

1119
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,319
potentially increase motivation the

1120
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,920
team's motivation increased and uh

1121
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:10,559
stakeholders are were also starting bu

1122
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,440
to build trust with a team right they

1123
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:17,000
are showing something valuable to us

1124
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,319
they are asking for the feedback so if

1125
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,319
you think about great proper Sprint

1126
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:24,920
review this is what was uh was happening

1127
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:27,920
there without connecting to scrum

1128
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,680
without vocabulary but with exactly the

1129
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,359
same purpose yeah exactly the same

1130
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:36,000
outcomes that should be expected from

1131
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:39,319
sprin TR

1132
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,280
yeah we just rename everything in scrum

1133
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:47,359
and just go for no I'm just

1134
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:50,000
kidding you know that that's the tool

1135
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,799
right and ability to find the common

1136
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,039
ground is I believe oh my God I will

1137
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:57,400
tell that as a PST this is the most

1138
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:00,799
important thing right to find a common

1139
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,359
ground to focus on valuable goals to be

1140
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:07,079
committed team willing to work together

1141
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:10,680
this is actually the essence of

1142
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:13,319
agility not fancy names right they never

1143
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,599
were supposed to be fancy

1144
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:16,599
yeah it's

1145
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,599
true yeah great group I love trainings

1146
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:28,440
in small groups because everyone has a

1147
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:31,000
lot of space for discussions well and it

1148
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,480
feels safer as well right because

1149
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,720
there's not a bunch of other people that

1150
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,520
we don't

1151
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:42,039
know yeah natural Vegas rule right well

1152
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:44,079
chin in Polish what happens in choin

1153
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:47,880
stays in

1154
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,160
choin so Mo Moana all of our all of or

1155
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,720
many of our new classes are using the

1156
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,839
immersive

1157
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:58,559
format um which is the multi-week

1158
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:01,599
sessions um so I I guess it's not as

1159
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,599
conducive for I want my I want to pass

1160
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,160
my certificate as quickly as possible

1161
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,680
Right but I think it's much more

1162
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:12,400
valuable from the perspective

1163
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,440
of I I I want to I want to learn the

1164
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,920
stuff and figure out how to apply it as

1165
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:20,200
well and get help with applying it um so

1166
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:24,200
I know it would be a a longer investment

1167
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:27,079
right but um I think it can be more

1168
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,359
value at the end of the

1169
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:32,000
day but also sometimes you just want the

1170
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,000
certificate

1171
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,839
right we have short classes

1172
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,599
too no I definitely think it'll be like

1173
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:43,160
useful and I think like through like the

1174
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,799
courses that I've done it's just like

1175
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,160
even building like group of people that

1176
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:49,240
you can kind of connect with and kind of

1177
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,920
share thoughts and challenges it's been

1178
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,640
really useful just to kind of have drop

1179
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,760
in

1180
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,160
sessions um but yeah but it's just it's

1181
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,760
just very interesting when you worked

1182
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,400
somewhere for four or five years and you

1183
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,760
worked and you've implemented and it's

1184
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,960
you know and you go somewhere else and

1185
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,039
it's completely different and it's

1186
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,039
completely different

1187
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,119
challenges but at the same times there

1188
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:14,200
are things that are exactly the same

1189
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:17,480
right yeah this it a lot of the problems

1190
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:21,880
that pop up are kind of the

1191
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,880
same uh yeah there

1192
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:31,599
both well I for one need to drop I have

1193
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,200
an Azure devops drop in clinic for a

1194
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,640
customer in a few minutes um although I

1195
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,880
see people have already started joining

1196
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,599
but there you go people join early um

1197
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,880
it's because it's set it 5 minutes past

1198
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,960
the hour it's one of those weird ones

1199
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:50,319
the the the people go oh it must be at

1200
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:52,160
the time so um hopefully you

1201
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,319
enjoyed the

1202
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,200
discussion um and if you do if you do
