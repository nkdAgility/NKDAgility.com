    "description": "Making Agile Decisions in a Complex World: Why There Are No Rules\n\nIn this video, I explore why decision-making in agile environments is more complex than ever and why there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to using data, telemetry, or evidence-based management. \n\nI share insights into how traditional decision-making frameworks from complicated systems no longer apply in today’s complex and dynamic environments. Using examples from logistics and software engineering, I explain why businesses need to embrace flexibility and creativity to adapt to ever-changing conditions.\n\nWho should watch this video? \n\nIf you’re a product manager, Scrum Master, agile leader, or anyone trying to make informed decisions in a fast-paced, complex world, this video is for you. Learn how to adopt a mindset that continuously evolves as you encounter new challenges, surprises, and opportunities in product development and business operations.\n\nChapters:\n\n0:00 Introduction to Agile Decision Making  \n0:23 Why Traditional Decision Frameworks Don’t Work Anymore  \n1:38 Chess vs. Poker: Understanding Complex Systems  \n2:24 The Downside of Using Off-the-Shelf Business Models  \n4:00 Red Team Thinking: What We Can Learn from the Military  \n5:28 Embracing Complexity and Unknowns in Product Development  \n7:02 Adapting Your Business Model to Stay Competitive  \n8:03 The Risks of Staying Stuck in Bureaucracy  \n9:50 How Emergent Decision-Making Helps Businesses Thrive  \n11:05 Tools for Agile Decision Making (Fist of Five, Lean Coffee, etc.)  \n13:18 The Danger of Letting Business Processes Become Rusty  \n14:20 Conclusion: Evolving Your Business Practices to Stay Relevant  \n\nBy the end of this video, you’ll understand why agile decision-making is an ongoing process of adaptation, not a rigid framework. I’ll provide examples of how to embrace emergence, use the right tools for the right situation, and avoid getting stuck in outdated processes. \n\nIf you found this video useful, please like, subscribe, and visit https://www.nkdagility.com for more content on agility and decision-making.\n\n#evidencebasedmanagement #evidencebasedleadership #agile #productdevelopment #productmanager",
