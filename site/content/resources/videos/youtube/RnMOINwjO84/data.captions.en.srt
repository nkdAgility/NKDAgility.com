1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,320
if you're looking

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:12,040
for um rules on how to make informed

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,120
decisions based on the data that you've

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,440
collected uh whether it's from

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,720
evidence-based management Telemetry data

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,080
whatever you're data you're collecting

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,680
um I you're not going to find it you're

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,160
not going to find something that you can

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,640
apply everywhere um there are in Times

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,480
Gone by there have been um large

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,760
decision- making Frameworks um that

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,920
generally apply

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,800
because we

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,520
lived in a complicated world not a

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,160
complex one so if you think about

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:56,120
um complexity Theory right uh if you

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,600
think about if we

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,800
understand more about a thing we're

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,039
going to go do

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,239
than we don't

21
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,159
know right that's like playing chess we

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:10,560
understand more than we don't know then

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,360
we can apply a bunch of rules we know

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,040
what the next move is right when you

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,799
when you if you've ever listened watch

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,479
uh professional chess game and listen to

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,320
the commentary right they know exactly

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,720
what the next move is supposed to be and

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,640
the only time when

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,119
there's B based on the set of exchanges

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,560
depending how smart the commentator is

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,960
right how far ahead they can think they

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,280
know who's going to win and then it's

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,960
does somebody make a

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,399
mistake that's

36
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,840
how I think lots of modern businesses

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,240
are

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:57,360
failing so take for example I'm going to

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,640
use an example non technology example um

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,960
take for example uh uh

41
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,720
Logistics right so let's say you're a

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,239
Hauling Company and you're going to haul

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,239
stuff from A to B um in trucks so you

44
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,360
have your drivers you have your trucks

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,319
you need to do schedules you need to do

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
um H procurement for what goes in what

47
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,440
truck and how it's organized in the

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,040
truck and all of those kind of things if

49
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:31,319
you go buy offthe shelf

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,160
software that everybody else uses to

51
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,200
right so everybody all your competitors

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,319
are using exactly the same

53
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,319
software to to manage this perhaps

54
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,959
you're buy sap right and then having the

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,879
poge plugin and the staff management

56
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:52,360
plug-in and the whatever stuff it has

57
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:56,360
right then your business is no longer

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,879
unique right you're you're um filling a

59
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,640
known Niche with a known business model

60
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,280
that

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,280
works and then the only difference

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,080
between you and your competitors is

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,200
probably quality maybe right like if

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,080
you're if you're are you on

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,920
time um are you are you on time did you

66
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,159
have the right stuff like the people

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,760
errors right are you on time are the

68
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
right stuff delivered to the right place

69
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,280
um and then you build a reputation

70
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,840
around that this is a good Hol company

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,439
because they mostly do the right thing

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,799
this is a bad Hol company because they

73
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,280
mostly do the bad thing and then they'll

74
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,599
go out of business and you'll stay in

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,040
business because they mostly do the

76
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,360
wrong thing and you mostly do the right

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,200
thing but your business models are

78
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,680
identical your business practices are

79
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,560
identical because they have to be

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,959
because you have to fit within the

81
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,360
plugins the business model plugins that

82
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,920
you've brought in for for for for sap

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,799
right um

84
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,239
but when we

85
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,959
work in a world

86
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,840
where we

87
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,840
know

88
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,840
less upfront than we discover by

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,000
doing right so that's anything where

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,479
we're bringing in a creative element

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,479
software engineering being creative

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
um anything where there's a lot of

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:32,400
unknowns so a a a a great set of this is

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,560
is red team thinking uh which is a a

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,039
military um tool red team thinking comes

96
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,240
from the the the military I don't

97
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,600
remember if there's a us or the British

98
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,120
military probably the US military um but

99
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,360
it's a a military model that that is

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
applied quite heavily in the agile space

101
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,680
because we're talking about the same

102
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,280
thing we're talking about complexity

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880
we're talking about um fog we've got

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,320
this a lot of

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,320
unknowns um and how do we move forward

106
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,000
while being able to adapt to any any

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,960
challenges surprises or opportunities as

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,120
as we move forward and and the world

109
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,000
reveals itself right um that's something

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,560
that that that the military do very well

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,759
or hopefully do very well um and we need

112
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,199
to do very well at it because most of

113
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,680
the all of the stuff that we do when

114
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,199
we're building software because we're

115
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
writing code it's never been done before

116
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,199
if you're writing code that's been done

117
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,199
before you're doing it wrong stop doing

118
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,120
that um but when you're Building

119
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:43,800
Products that don't exist yet then

120
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,120
we're exploring the unknown right so

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,680
think about when the Explorers went out

122
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,000
to go somewhere new they didn't know

123
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,880
what they were going to find when they

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
get there they didn't know what was

125
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,319
going to happen along the way so they

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,800
had to take into account bring all of

127
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,440
the things they needed uh scurvy was was

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,080
a was a early explorers had a lot of

129
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,080
scurvy because they didn't have the

130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,240
right vitamins right so what they found

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,599
was they could take citrus fruits which

132
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,759
lasted a long time in storage if you

133
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:19,880
store them right um and then you you you

134
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,000
you you can Pro provide that to your

135
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,599
crew and they don't get scurvy right

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,039
because they get the vitamins that are

137
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:30,080
missing from the normal normal diet and

138
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,199
that adaption enabled

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,479
those explorers that did that to go

140
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:38,639
further and the explorers that didn't do

141
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,440
that all died so which ones the ones

142
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,759
that came back what did they do they did

143
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
this right let's do more of that and

144
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,360
that's what we're talking about when we

145
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,160
talk about agile right when we talk

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,479
about agility it's about a being

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,960
creating a system for your way of work

148
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,960
that adapts

149
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,479
dynamically to those those those changes

150
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,639
we have emergent everything's emergent

151
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,639
right we have emergent knowledge we have

152
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,800
emergent data we have um emergent

153
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,440
customers we don't know who our

154
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,440
customers are yet and what they're going

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,800
to want and then we get some of those

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,479
customers and we understand what they

157
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,840
want so we deliver something to them but

158
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,360
it's not quite right because they don't

159
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,720
like what we've delivered so how we need

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:28,280
to keep adapting continuously evolving

161
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:32,240
our product our business um to fill a NE

162
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,160
a a a a unique Niche that we've created

163
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,840
for ourselves and then perhaps we

164
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,479
maintain that Niche but those nishes

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,560
don't exist forever right um it used to

166
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,520
be in the old the old days of the

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,879
Industrial Revolution where there

168
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,960
weren't that many textile mills and

169
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,560
there weren't that many textile miles

170
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,919
within selling distance right perhaps

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,280
you as a as a tailor and you're buying

172
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,840
cloth you're buying it from the local

173
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,280
textile mill you have no option you're

174
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,960
buying the bulk of your stuff from the

175
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,319
local textile mill and then maybe you

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,720
can get some really expensive stuff from

177
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,520
the fari store you know wherever you

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,240
manag to get that that really expensive

179
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
stuff from but that's not for your main

180
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,360
client tell your main clientele is going

181
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,159
to be the stuff from the factory up the

182
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,400
road whereas today you can get stuff

183
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:28,039
from any Factory anywhere in the world

184
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:33,200
for a relatively competitive price so

185
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:36,000
that that that Market that Niche um that

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,959
those factories were in is is largely

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,120
gone it's not a it's not a niche anymore

188
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,039
there's loads of competing species

189
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,519
within that within that area same for

190
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,880
for our companies as as competition

191
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,440
grows we either have to become unique in

192
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,240
different ways or um we need to be the

193
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,920
best in that space in order to not have

194
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,800
any of this competition come in and as

195
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,640
we grow as a business this is all part

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,200
of this data driven decision- making

197
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,959
right as we grow as a

198
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,480
business we have a

199
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,399
tendency to say well this worked one

200
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,440
time let's write that down and everybody

201
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,360
does it that way that's

202
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,959
bureaucracy that's what we're fighting

203
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,880
against with agility because the next

204
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,399
thing we do is slightly different just a

205
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,959
little bit but slightly different so

206
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,279
this is not optim optimal anymore but it

207
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,560
kind of works but time change after

208
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,920
change after change after change

209
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,480
eventually this doesn't work anymore but

210
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,480
everybody in the company still does it

211
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,600
because that's the way we do

212
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,839
things that's the mindset we're trying

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,320
to change we're trying to change to a

214
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,040
mindset

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,839
that we we don't keep this longer than

216
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,519
it's necessary we don't keep this longer

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,279
than it's valuable any process or

218
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,079
practice we have emergent practices

219
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,200
within our organization any process or

220
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,200
practice ice can be dissolved at any

221
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
time because it's deemed to be no longer

222
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,040
optimal or suboptimal every this this

223
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,519
set of story should continually change

224
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,680
if it's not changed why hasn't it

225
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,519
changed because the world will have

226
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,240
changed our environment will have

227
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,680
changed and we need to continually adapt

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,680
and that that

229
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,320
that's agile decision making right it's

230
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
emergent how we make decisions is

231
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,240
emergent based on what we understand

232
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,519
what we're doing what we're trying to

233
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
achieve and the results that we get

234
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,639
based on that decision making so you're

235
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,720
also continuously looking at the data

236
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,360
and analyzing your decision did we make

237
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
the right decision are we continuously

238
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,399
making the wrong decision if we're

239
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
continuously making the wrong decision

240
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,600
why are we continuously making the wrong

241
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,320
decision and what is our decision-making

242
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,440
process because it needs to change

243
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
because we're continually making the

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,720
wrong decision so there's not really any

245
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,760
there are lots of tools out there that

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,399
you can use actually I had a I had a

247
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,279
quick look uh for for agile decision-

248
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,279
making tools and I I I found a few that

249
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,800
I recognize that I have used in the

250
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,360
past but maybe not used recently right

251
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
um so fist of five if you've got a group

252
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,440
of people and you need to make a

253
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,200
decision fist of five great way to to to

254
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
to make a decision is that going to last

255
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,399
forever are you always going to do fist

256
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,200
of five in that same group of people

257
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:39,440
probably not right because it's

258
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,760
usefulness as you start working together

259
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,360
for longer as a team you maybe recognize

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,079
more each other's Tails right and then

261
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,200
you don't need that mechanism anymore so

262
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:55,360
so stop doing it if it's not adding

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,959
value stop doing it if anything in your

264
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,600
business is no longer adding value or

265
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,920
it's actively inhibiting value stop

266
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,399
doing it and do something different

267
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,600
right I I see this in organization after

268
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,200
organization where they have a

269
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,240
departmental model and some department

270
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,440
has decided that you can't do a thing in

271
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,560
an organization and that thing that you

272
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,600
can't do inhibits all of this value over

273
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,320
here either makes it slower it makes it

274
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,320
harder for our us to take advantage of

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,839
opportunities it it just makes it too

276
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,240
hard to do business so the people over

277
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
here stop trying to do those things

278
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,000
because it's too hard usually this is

279
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
security right

280
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,240
and that

281
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:43,480
department has forgotten that they work

282
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,839
for the business the business does not

283
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,639
work for them their purpose for being is

284
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,519
to protect the business right perhaps

285
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:54,440
that department medal is a protection

286
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,560
model so compliance or or or security or

287
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,000
those kind of things but

288
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,880
they're um protecting the business

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,399
within the context of the business

290
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,199
actually functioning as soon as they're

291
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,519
inhibiting the business functioning they

292
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:12,360
are cost not a value they're supposed to

293
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,639
figure out we need to do this how do we

294
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:19,360
do this so that you're you you you can

295
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:22,639
be happy not no you can't do this right

296
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,000
that so that's that's a an example of

297
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:31,120
that organizational crft right that rust

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,120
and building up over time

299
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,600
that rust building up over time and

300
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,519
inhibiting your ability to deliver value

301
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,160
because you're you're stuck in the past

302
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,480
even if the past was only five minutes

303
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,320
ago maybe you're stuck in the past um

304
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,759
so use whatever

305
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,279
tools make sense within the context of

306
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,720
the decision that you're making but

307
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,199
always

308
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,320
check is that tool that we're using so

309
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:07,959
could be uh fist of five uh dacky

310
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:11,480
racy uh decider protocol conent consent

311
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:13,519
decision making lean coffee holoc dely

312
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,519
right there's a lot dot voting round

313
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:21,560
robin loads of different ways to do

314
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:24,279
that if we use that and we have a bad

315
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,000
decision or we use it in a bunch of

316
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,880
decision- making and all of those

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
decisions ended up wrong or the majority

318
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,639
of those ended up wrong then stop doing

319
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,399
it that's the key to this um agile

320
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,680
process to this

321
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,519
um figuring out how to make decisions

322
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,800
within the the context there are there

323
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,360
aren't any rules for you to go look up

324
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,759
there aren't any known practices that

325
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,480
always work um and that's true across

326
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,880
all of agility and all of all of all of

327
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,880
lean um there are certain rules that we

328
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,839
know to be true

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,639
right they're but they're not then rules

330
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:09,399
they're laws right Little's law is a

331
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,839
great example of that queuing theory

332
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,800
it's it's true it that's how that's how

333
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,560
things

334
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,000
work so we make decisions within the

335
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,600
context of that

336
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
story

337
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,600
um figure out what the laws are that

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,519
apply to your

339
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,720
business and everything

340
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,759
else is

341
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,240
flexible everything else is flexible how

342
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:39,399
you do business is flexible how you find

343
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,240
business how you engage with customers

344
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:47,600
as flexible um emergent right how you um

345
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,120
how people do the work is emergent how

346
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,759
you engage with them how you do

347
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,800
everything that you do needs to be

348
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,040
emergent because what you want to be

349
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,560
able to do as a business is when the

350
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,720
market shift

351
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,240
or your environment changes you need to

352
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,480
be able to evolve and you need to be

353
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,759
able to evolve as quickly as possible

354
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,759
because you don't want to go extinct
