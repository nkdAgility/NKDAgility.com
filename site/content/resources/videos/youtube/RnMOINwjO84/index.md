# Making Data Driven Decisions - Decision making frameworks

Making Agile Decisions in a Complex World: Why There Are No Rules

In this video, I explore why decision-making in agile environments is more complex than ever and why there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to using data, telemetry, or evidence-based management. 

I share insights into how traditional decision-making frameworks from complicated systems no longer apply in today’s complex and dynamic environments. Using examples from logistics and software engineering, I explain why businesses need to embrace flexibility and creativity to adapt to ever-changing conditions.
