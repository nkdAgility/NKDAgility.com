1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,200
if there was one thing that new product

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,800
owners should know above all the other

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,160
things that we've talked about that's

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:17,680
that they need to focus on continuous

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,880
learning they need to be looking at um

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,760
what's happening in the industry what's

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,439
happening in the market what are the new

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,119
new tools and techniques that are

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,599
available it doesn't mean you're going

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,160
to use use them there's always a little

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
bit of a danger of the cult of the new

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,840
right well we're using it because it's

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,120
new but you need to understand all of

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,200
the different tools and techniques that

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,680
are available to you at least enough to

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,559
know what thing you might choose for a

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,079
particular circumstance so you can have

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,920
a goal the more tools you have in the

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,399
toolbox the better um there's a great uh

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,039
uh blog post that I read years ago it

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,600
was focused on um developers uh coders

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,199
but it applied the theory applies just

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,159
the same and it started with the phrase

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,240
if you're reading this you're already in

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,759
the top

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,720
10% and that's because there's only a

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:19,040
small number of uh people that actually

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,119
focus on continuous learning that

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
actually try new things all the time

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,320

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,360
different techniques and different

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,600
topics they don't have to be new they

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,640
can just be new to you they can be older

34
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,520
things that you're uh going and figuring

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
out crossing the chasm was written in

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,720
