short_title: Lessons in Agile Consulting Readiness
description: A personal account highlighting the importance of organisational readiness, engagement, and listening for successful agile consulting and meaningful change in teams.
tldr: Organisations must be ready and willing to engage for agile consulting to be effective; without this, even the best advice will be ignored and no real progress will happen. Repeated experiences showed that lack of readiness and follow-through leads to wasted effort and stagnation. Development managers should ensure their teams are prepared to listen and act before bringing in external help.

Reflecting on My Worst Day as an Agile Consultant

As an agile consultant, I’ve had my fair share of challenging days, but one experience stands out as particularly memorable, though perhaps not in the way you might expect. It raises an important question: was it my worst day, or was it the customer's?

Let me take you back to that week in the US. I arrived at the organisation, ready to dive in and help them tackle their challenges. I was shown to my cubicle, settled in, and then… nothing. For two or three hours, I sat there, waiting for someone to engage with me. It was as if I had been placed in a time capsule, completely forgotten.

I decided to reach out to my boss, Steve Borg, to share my predicament. “I’m just sitting here,” I explained. “Nobody’s come by, and it seems like they’re not ready for me.” After a few calls, Steve informed me that they hadn’t prepared for my arrival. In fact, they booked me a flight home, and it took the customer three days to realise I was gone. That’s how unprepared they were for any sort of change.

This experience highlighted a critical lesson: readiness for change is essential. If an organisation isn’t prepared to listen or act, then my role as a consultant becomes nearly impossible.

Interestingly, this wasn’t an isolated incident. I found myself returning to the same organisation for three consecutive years, at the same time, with the same group of people. Each time, I would provide them with a comprehensive report detailing the changes they needed to make. And each year, I was met with the same response: “We’ve done none of the things you suggested.”

It was disheartening. I was there to help, yet it felt like I was spinning my wheels, unable to drive any meaningful progress. The same issues persisted, and I was left [troubleshooting]({{< ref "/tags/troubleshooting" >}}) minor problems rather than facilitating substantial change.

Here are a few key takeaways from these experiences:

- **Readiness is Key**: An organisation must be prepared to embrace change. Without this readiness, any advice or strategies I provide will fall on deaf ears.
- **Value of Engagement**: If I’m not receiving problems to solve, it’s a sign that the organisation may not be ready for my help. I’ve learned to be upfront about this; if my advice is ignored, it may be time to reassess our partnership.

- **The Importance of Listening**: It’s frustrating to see an organisation ignore warnings about potential pitfalls. When they eventually come back, seeking help after the fact, it’s often too late to make a significant impact.

- **[Continuous Improvement]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-improvement" >}})**: Agile is all about iterating and improving. If an organisation isn’t willing to act on feedback, they risk stagnation.

In conclusion, while my worst day as an agile consultant was certainly challenging, it served as a powerful reminder of the importance of readiness and engagement in the agile journey. If you find yourself in a similar situation, remember that change is a two-way street. Both the consultant and the organisation must be committed to the process for it to be successful.
