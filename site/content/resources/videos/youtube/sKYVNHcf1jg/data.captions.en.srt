1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,040
um so the question is what was your

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,639
worst day as an agile consultant and I

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,619
think the the worst well was it was it

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,900
my worst day or was it the customer's

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,580
worst day the worst day I can I I

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,100
actually think of is

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,199
um going going into an organization I'm

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,720
going to be on site for a week so I'm

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,699
Consulting right I need to help them fix

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,700
their stuff

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,040
um and I get into the office Sean to a

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,380
cubicle this was in the US so I got

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,140
shown to a here's your desk uh for the

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,879
week uh Sean's the cubicle sat down and

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,040
then the person that that sat me down

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,860
disappeared

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,219
um and I was sitting there for I don't

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,399
know two or three hours nobody had come

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,219
by nothing was going on

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,160
um so I just you know I called my my

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,680
boss at the time Steve Borg and I said

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,300
uh I'm just I'm just sitting here by the

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,700
way they're not doing anything he's like

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,860
what do you mean what do you mean

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,200
just just sitting in this Cube everybody

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,020
disappeared and he's like oh let me see

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,900
if I can find find anybody he made a few

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,880
calls they weren't ready for me yet so

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,320
he called me back and he said uh we

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,140
booked a flight for you just go to the

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,240
airport and come on home and it took the

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,799
customer three days to realize it was no

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
longer there

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,939
took them three days to realize that I'd

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,860
just gone home that's how long it took

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,900
them to be ready for me and that was

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,240
three days into a five-day engagement

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,400
right

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,960
um so that was probably the worst day

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,700
for the for the for the customer they

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,560
just weren't ready right they weren't

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,900
ready for any sort of change they

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,280
obviously weren't ready to listen

44
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,759
um and they weren't ready to do that but

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,259
I I'm not ready to listen I also did the

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,939
same engagement three years in a row

47
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,280
with a customer

48
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,540
same time a year same group of people

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,340
they would invite me to their

50
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,840
organization we'd sit in the boardroom

51
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,180
they'd talk about all the stuff they're

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,040
doing I'd give them a bunch of advice I

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,840
did a whole bunch of interviews with

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,640
everybody lots of different people at

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,440
different levels in the organization I

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,780
created a lovely report this was the

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,040
first time I went lovely report on here

58
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,200
are the things you need to fix the

59
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,060
things you need to try

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,680
um changes you might want to make things

61
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,120
you might want to do and then I would

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,500
come back the next year and they'd be

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,720
like yep we've done none of the things

64
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,340
you said let's have a chat and figure

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
out what we should do next and it was

66
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,540
exactly the same things because nothing

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,700
had changed right

68
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,700
um and I would come back year after year

69
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,620
to the same company for the same few

70
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,840
days on site with the same group of

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,400
people who would agree that they haven't

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
done anything to change anything and

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,959
then we would maybe troubleshoot some

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,640
small issues around the edges and help

75
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,900
them out but

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,540
um again

77
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,519
that's not a good day as an agile

78
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,500
consultant because you're not making

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
progress you're not helping the customer

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,280
you're not providing them with value

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,519
right

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,819
so I always feel like I work with lots

83
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,040
of customers and if

84
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,720
I'm not if I'm working as an agile

85
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,700
consultant and I'm not getting fed

86
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,500
problems

87
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,019
um by the by the organization right to

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,280
be able to help them out I'm gonna

89
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,379
wander off

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,000
right and I I'm usually pretty clear if

91
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,060
it's a longer engagement I'm usually

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,040
pretty clear on that up front right if I

93
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,800
feel like I'm giving you a bunch of

94
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,280
advice and you're you're just ignoring

95
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,500
it then maybe we're not a good fit and I

96
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,360
shouldn't be here anymore and I think

97
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,640
those are the days that kind of suck is

98
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,200
when nobody's listening to you you're

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,580
seeing the things you're saying this

100
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,560
thing's gonna happen if you keep doing

101
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,720
it this way and then you've just got to

102
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,680
sit there and watch them fall into that

103
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,080
trap

104
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,860
and then they come to you and say oh

105
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,200
we're so we're so broken can you can you

106
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,760
we're we're totally hosed now can you

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,920
help us fix and it's like we'll we'll

108
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,000
know like six weeks ago when I told you

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,940
about the problem was when you could

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,180
have fixed it now you you pretty much

111
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,519
want to pay the fine for non non

112
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,980
whatever non-contract completion and

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,140
walk away because that's all you've got

114
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,299
left I think those are the days that

115
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,299
kind of suck as a as an agile consultant
