#agileconsulting can be incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.

You get to work with amazing clients and for the most part, you're the dreamweaver that empowers the team to successfully adopt #agile and rock with #productdevelopment.

The flip side is that it can all go horribly wrong, super quickly, and it is inevitable that it does. You simply can't hit a home run every time you are at bat.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about his worst day as an #agileconsultant
