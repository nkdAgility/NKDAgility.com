1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,520
with evidence-based management it's

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,880
really important to gather the data the

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,440
evidence that you're going to use to

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,080
help you in your decision- making to

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,359
help inform your decision making so we

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,119
need to to gather a bunch of data and

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,400
then we need to be able to analyze that

8
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,720
data there's lots of different places

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,519
you can get your data from depending on

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,840
what type of data it is that you need so

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,000
if you're remember there are uh four key

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,800
value areas in uh evidencebased

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,879
management that we want to kind of try

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,559
and make sure that we have at least

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,039
something in each of those

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,120
areas so in each of those key value

17
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,360
areas we want to find what it is we want

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,920
to collect and then figure out how to

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,399
collect it then we have to actually

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,960
collect it and then collecting it's not

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
good enough we have to actually analyze

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,840
it so uh there are some areas that are

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,879
easier than others so in the the

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,159
organizational capability the two um key

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,680
value areas that are part of

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,040
organizational capability uh uh time to

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,920
Market and ability to innovate um

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,159
there's a plethora of data that you can

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,680
collect within the context of your

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,680
engineering teams my focus tends to be

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,880
around engineering uh software

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,000
engineering so uh I might collect at

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,600
things like how much technical debt do I

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,119
have how many bugs do I have uh over

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,320
time right so the trend of of of bugs I

36
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,159
might be collecting oh there's loads of

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,680
data I can collect um I could collect

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,720
code coverage or the trend of code

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,119
coverage over time that might be uh

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,280
valuable at some point there are

41
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,320
hundreds of different data points that

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,880
we can we can collect within that

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
context uh a few that might make sense

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,240
so in if you're in ability to innovate

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,240
you'll probably find a lot of metrics at

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,039
coming from D if you look up the Dora

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,600
metrics lots of great stuff in there so

48
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,560
there's things like defect Trends but

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
also Innovation rate is really important

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,120
what percentage of time do you spend

51
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,160
innovating versus doing all the other

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,680
stuff that you need to do um and

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,000
collecting things like technical debt um

54
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,760
so some of these things are easy to

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
collect um Innovation rate is fairly

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,480
easy you just categorize the work that

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,560
you're doing as net newwork um

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,120
augmentations to existing functionality

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,160
and then and support support and

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,599
maintenance work whatever you want to

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
call those categories um and then you

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,879
you graph that over time right so you'll

63
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,560
be able to see uh uh uh what's going on

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,959
there and you can then make decisions

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,280
right um based on the amount of money

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,400
that you're investing in each of those

67
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,159
areas do you want to change how you in

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
your investment strategy Works um do you

69
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,800
want to spend more time on Innovation or

70
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,879
do you need to spend more time on um

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,599
augmenting your existing functionality

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,120
and that might depend on some of the

73
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,120
other metrics from the market value side

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,519
of the story right so in in in market

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,080
value we had current value so what our

76
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,239
product currently does and unrealized

77
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
value which is the things that our

78
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,000
product might do that it doesn't do yet

79
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,560
so this would ultimately result in your

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,959
product backlog and this is your actual

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,799
increment your actual product so if we

82
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,560
were looking at data for your actual

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,319
product we might uh be looking at

84
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,200
something like uh customer satisfaction

85
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,040
how satisfied are the users of your

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,840
product with your product how satisfied

87
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,439
are they with the features do they meet

88
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,599
their needs you know there's a bunch of

89
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,280
questions you can ask around that um

90
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,599
interviews you can do to try and get

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,760
some of that data and and that might

92
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,560
inform where where you want your

93
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,959
Innovation rate to be right if your

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,319
existing customers are very unhappy

95
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,480
then perhaps you need to address that

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,319
right perhaps you need to invest more in

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,840
augmenting the existing stuff or

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,879
figuring out what you're missing in that

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
space that could be an expectations gap

100
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,280
which would be more on the um unrealized

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,239
value Right Stuff your product doesn't

102
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,040
do yet but understanding that data

103
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:25,280
informs the decisions that you make so

104
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,600
there's a piece of data um in in our

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,400
organizational capability specifically

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,840
in ability to innovate um and our

107
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Innovation

108
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:39,400
rate our decision on what should we do

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,240
with that data depends on this other

110
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,880
data right data on how people feel about

111
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,160
our current product or the features in

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,039
our current product maybe it's all the

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,240
way down to individual features

114
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,400
granularity is quite important there and

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,000
what we're missing in our product and if

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,520
we're missing a lot we probably want to

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,960
invest a lot of money in the missing

118
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,919
stuff if we're not missing much but our

119
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,520
customers are unhappy we probably want

120
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,360
to invest a lot in uh increasing the the

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,880
satisfaction of our customers within our

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
our existing product structure and all

123
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
of these

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,520
decisions are informed but not

125
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,160
controlled by the data right so um not

126
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,680
only do we need to collect the data but

127
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,960
we need to realize that just because the

128
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,479
data says something doesn't mean we

129
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,000
should immediately act upon it there are

130
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,520
some things that you absolutely should

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,720
immediately act on like if defects Trend

132
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,600
the trend of defects is suddenly

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,479
shooting up or um customer satisfaction

134
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,080
suddenly takes a big drop those are

135
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,319
things that you want to check the data

136
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,319
first then perhaps have some kind of

137
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,080
bigger action on it um but you there are

138
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,919
times where you might take the opposite

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
action so one of the things things that

140
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,000
you would collect definitely collect in

141
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,680
uh um current value is your us usage

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,319
index is what they call it in evidence

143
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,880
base management um but um how what it's

144
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,599
usage data it's Telemetry in your

145
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,639
product right so um do you know if you

146
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,520
have a if you have a button that takes

147
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,080
you to a

148
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,919
feature um and that feature has options

149
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,960
um how many what percentage of your

150
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:37,280
users use that feature how often do they

151
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,639
use that feature and when they do use

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,880
that feature what parts of that feature

153
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,919
do they interact with that should be

154
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,680
data that you have on hand right that's

155
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,800
data that we can reasonably easily

156
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,960
collect it requires engineering work

157
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,039
your your your developers need to add

158
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,360
stuff to your product to collect that

159
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,720
data um if you're building a website you

160
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,720
might get some of that with Google

161
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,720
analytics but um usually we're we're

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,560
we're looking for a deeper story than

163
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,039
just what pages are hit depending on the

164
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,479
way your website's constructed if you're

165
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:14,280
doing web um but um exactly what

166
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,800
features how long features take to load

167
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,479
um how long actions take these are all

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,400
parts of that that Telemetry story that

169
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,400
give you an absolute wealth of of of

170
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:31,440
data that you can access um I Heard a

171
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:34,160
great story um from uh a car company

172
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,000
that I that I worked with um and they

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,879
were talking about how easy it was to

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,720
access dat that that data within their

175
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,840
organization their organization most car

176
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,319
companies collect this type of telemetry

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,000
even if they have no overthe a updates

178
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,440
when your car goes in for a a service

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,639
and they connect up the computer system

180
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,800
at the dealership um it sucks down all

181
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,240
of the the Telemetry data on all of the

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,319
gear shift how the gear shifts performed

183
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,319
there's a big log in the system they

184
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,000
load that data and it gets sent off to

185
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,560
or for faults and all those kind of

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,159
things that gets sent off to um the

187
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,199
parent company and then the idea is you

188
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,280
would analyze that data right uh and

189
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,080
they were talking about their inability

190
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,159
to access that data even though it

191
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
exists to get access to data to a slice

192
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,440
of that data to a piece of that data

193
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,519
required a whole bunch of time and

194
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,279
approvals and it was I think they in

195
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,080
this particular case they said something

196
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,200
like 6 to8 months before they could get

197
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,680
access to the data once they requested

198
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:48,720
it and that's far too long that's us

199
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:52,519
then making business decisions based on

200
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,480
six to8 month old data Because by the

201
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,120
time we get it we get that slice of the

202
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,920
data it's old and we need a new slice of

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,000
the data um whereas

204
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,440
they told me that they work one of their

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,800
colleagues worked at Tesla uh and at

206
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,079
Tesla everybody has access to all of

207
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,920
that data instantaneously continuously

208
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,760
you can go look at the real time stream

209
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,120
of that data from the Cars um to know

210
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,360
what people are doing how people are

211
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,000
interacting with the features and

212
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,640
capabilities within the

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,320
car that's gamechanging data right um

214
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,040
having it at all is

215
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,120
gamechanging having access to as close

216
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,320
to where people as close to real time it

217
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,320
doesn't have to be real time real time

218
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
is a a little bit of a fallacy but as

219
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
close to real time as possible like if

220
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,079
if I'm if I'm working on a feature right

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,839
now and I'm doing let's say I'm I'm I'm

222
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,399
doing continuous delivery so I'm

223
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,800
shipping to production on a regular

224
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,120
basis let's say it's on average every

225
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,440
couple of days I'm shipping this feature

226
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,200
to production and it's shipping out to

227
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,320
all the cars like like Tesla does right

228
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,800
they do continuous updates then I want

229
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,399
data at this point I want as close to

230
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,360
this point as possible so I make a

231
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,440
change I ship it in I've got two days

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,519
till my next change I'm going to push

233
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,959
out what do I need to fix what do I need

234
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,519
to change well I'm going to be analyzing

235
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,640
the data in that segment to update my

236
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,079
product backlog and engage with the team

237
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,800
and figure out what what what needs to

238
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,320
happen this is this is what product

239
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,200
management is all about right you're

240
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,800
actually managing the product and you're

241
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,920
managing the product with the data to

242
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,560
understand how you need to manage the

243
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,000
product and this is this is hugely

244
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:47,680
important and and that

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,720
difference is your customers loving your

246
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,120
software or hating your software um I

247
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,360
have a I have a Nissan I have a Nissan

248
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,880
Leaf and their software is probably some

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,040
of the worst

250
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,639
least

251
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,440
useful I don't know how much more to

252
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,839
describe it is is the the most horrible

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,040
software to use and work with and the

254
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,200
least useful um from any perspective in

255
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,000
the way that it's constructed the way it

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,519
functions the way I engage with it it

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,160
doesn't provide me with the things I

258
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,800
want it doesn't provide me with the

259
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,920
things in a timely manner um it doesn't

260
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,240
it it's terrible it's just terrible um

261
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,519
and that's likely because nobody's

262
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,600
looking at the data nobody's looking at

263
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,720
I think it has the the the the Android

264
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,480
store it's got a I think it did have a

265
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,200
1.2 rating at one point it was horrible

266
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,839
horrible app um

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
that nobody must be looking at that data

268
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,240
or they don't care right if the business

269
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,440
doesn't care about that part of the

270
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,519
system then why provide it right maybe

271
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
they're providing it because they feel

272
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,480
they have to but if you have to provide

273
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,920
it because it's table Stakes it needs to

274
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,200
be good otherwise it reflects on your

275
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,959
company and your business right so um

276
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,680
collecting this data as a product

277
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,839
manager um is the whole ball game so we

278
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,440
we tal we we just talked about one

279
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
metric we started with an innovation

280
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,199
rate and we ended up connecting all

281
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,079
those stories together um the visual

282
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:28,880
studio team at Microsoft they get 7

283
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,279
terabytes of data per day and that's

284
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,519
just from the clients the visual studio

285
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,000
desktop clients out in the world that

286
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:40,040
are on networks that allow that data to

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,680
be to be sent lots of big organizations

288
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,079
have those things locked off so that

289
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,320
that data doesn't exit the network right

290
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,120
so this is just a subset of users but

291
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
it's a subset of data that they can

292
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,959
interact with that they can see what's

293
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519
going on in the product that they can

294
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,360
make a change and push it out and then

295
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,199
see almost real time whether they've

296
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,800
been successful or they've not in

297
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,480
achieving the the hypothesis that they

298
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,800
had right we think adding this feature

299
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,720
is going to make a change in people's

300
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,639
behavior in this way let's look at the

301
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,600
make a change look at the Telemetry did

302
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,440
we improve the user engagement with this

303
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,519
feature did we improve uh uh the number

304
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,959
of people that used it right if

305
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,399
not we didn't achieve our outcome with

306
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,800
that change let's think about why we

307
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,399
didn't do that maybe we want to talk to

308
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,519
a couple of users and figure out why

309
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,600
they didn't change their behavior right

310
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,839
all of those types of things are part of

311
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,000
building great

312
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,880
products so we've we've we've talked

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,639
about some where we can get some of the

314
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,399
data uh we talked about how to collect

315
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,399
the data um some of it is just I guess

316
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,519
uh uh I guess we talk about to collect

317
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:57,519
it some of it is just you stick it in

318
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,639
Excel right there's nothing nothing bad

319
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,040
about Excel is a great tool um so you

320
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,800
just record it on a on a regular Cadence

321
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,720
and and stick it in Excel that could be

322
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,560
from customer survey data that could be

323
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
a slice of your Innovation rate when

324
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,079
you're when you're looking at it if

325
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,880
you're really

326
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,120
um on the ball you might feed all of

327
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,519
that data that you have into a a data

328
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
warehouse and then use something like

329
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,959
powerbi to analyze it and have

330
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,079
dashboards that show you what's going on

331
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,639
uh um near real time in your product in

332
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,240
your system when your customers are

333
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,440
doing and how they're interacting with

334
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:38,079
it um there are leading measures and

335
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,759
lagging measures leading me measures are

336
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,199
ones that change frequently right that

337
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:44,639
you can get a you can make a change to

338
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,560
the system and then see that data

339
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
changing lagging measures are things

340
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,639
that take a little bit longer to to come

341
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,880
to fruition like if you surveyed users

342
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,920
on their satisfaction then that's going

343
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,680
to be a lagging measure right you're

344
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,320
making changes to the system isn't going

345
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,320
to immediately reflect changes to the

346
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,839
data um you would need to analyze it

347
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,880
over a longer period of time both are

348
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,560
important right um your leading stuff is

349
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,560
changing the work that you're doing

350
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,600
right now your lagging stuff is perhaps

351
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,759
affecting more your overall strategy and

352
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,880
what's going on there's a great example

353
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:25,199
of a a feature that the the visual

354
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,120
studio team built um called intelletrace

355
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,240
um if you don't know what it is it

356
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
doesn't matter but it was a big big

357
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,639
expensive feature really expensive

358
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,880
features it was only in the Enterprise

359
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
product to start with um and it was a

360
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,759
very expensive feature to build um I

361
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
can't overstate that enough it's like

362
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,519
huge amounts of money more ridiculous

363
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,839
amounts of money than we could possibly

364
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,720
imagine um and what they found was that

365
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,920
nobody was using it so they built this

366
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,040
feature they spent all this money on

367
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,079
this feature they shipped this feature

368
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,319
and then they're looking at the

369
00:15:53,079 --> 00:16:00,000
Telemetry and it says nobody's using

370
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:01,759
it so what do you do do you do you cut

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,040
that feature do you stop investing in

372
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,120
that feature do we invest more in that

373
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,160
feature we maybe need a little bit more

374
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,079
information so when when they did dive

375
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,560
into it right go see a little bit of

376
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,480
gamber right go have a look talk to

377
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,959
people they found that people weren't

378
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,440
using it because they didn't know it was

379
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:24,160
there and it was off by default and they

380
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,000
had to go turn it on in the settings um

381
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,279
so in the next version of the product

382
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,399
because this was actually when they were

383
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,040
on the two-yearly releases so it then

384
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:36,319
took them let's say 18 months or or or

385
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,959
uh whatever amount of time to to get

386
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:42,880
this change in so that's 18 months

387
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,120
of because people aren't using the

388
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,040
feature remember of that feature

389
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,319
effectively sitting on a shelf and

390
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,000
depreciating while your competitors

391
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,240
might have that feature and you do have

392
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,519
that feature but your customers don't

393
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
know it's there so they don't use it so

394
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
they might go to your competitors

395
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,399
because they think your competitors have

396
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,519
a feature that you don't

397
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,480
right um and when they turned it on by

398
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,520
default shipped it out nobody turned it

399
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,000
on very few people the percentage of

400
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,240
people that turned it off was very small

401
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,199
and then they were getting that usage

402
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,360
data and getting that usage Telemetry

403
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,120
that's why I always say the the data

404
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,280
that you collect informs but does not

405
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,520
control your decision- making because

406
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:30,039
then the the there needs to be more to

407
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,679
it than that you're playing poker not

408
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,400
chess right if you're playing

409
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,400
chess all of the

410
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,799
information that's

411
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,280
available is in your hands right you can

412
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,960
see the state of the board you know all

413
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,760
the moves you know all the possible

414
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,320
counter moves and that's where you get

415
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,320
to to those grandmas things with they're

416
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,840
thinking 20 30 moves ahead I don't know

417
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,440
how many moves ahead they think but

418
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,320
they're thinking so many moves ahead you

419
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,080
know it's 10 moves to checkmates right

420
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,120
and then how does this person get out of

421
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,720
it and the only way they can do that is

422
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:09,159
to to to I guess maybe fake you into

423
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,120
doing something or you make a mistake

424
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,559
right I'm going to win unless I make a

425
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,440
mistake I'm going to win this game and

426
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,679
there they know so there's there's no

427
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,799
hidden

428
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,159
information

429
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,080
um but

430
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:29,320
for Building Products it's more like

431
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,600
playing poker we have incom complete

432
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:36,240
information we don't understand all of

433
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,520
what's going on now ideally we want as

434
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,159
much information as we can on the things

435
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,440
we can find

436
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,880
out to fill in enough of the gaps so

437
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,440
that when we're looking at our big

438
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,600
picture or even our little picture we

439
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,919
can kind of say well we think this is

440
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,520
what's happening right we can infair the

441
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,559
missing information CU when you're

442
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,559
playing poker you know the cards in your

443
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,080
hand you know the card that are open on

444
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,720
the table on the type of pool you're

445
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,919
playing and but you don't know what your

446
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,640
your your competitors have got in their

447
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,280
hand and you don't know what the dealer

448
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,240
is hiding or what the next card's going

449
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,760
to come off the stack now if you're

450
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,679
really good at card counting if you're

451
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,679
Telemetry and data then you can have a

452
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,240
more informed decision making if you get

453
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,080
very good at reading the other players

454
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,480
around the table really reading their

455
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,840
emotional intent right the the the that

456
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,000
those those tails that they have then

457
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,280
you get more information that you can

458
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,640
use and that's who the best poker

459
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,679
players are right they are poker players

460
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,520
that recognize the cards that go through

461
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,440
the deck they so they've got good

462
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,400
memories they recognize um the emotional

463
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,640
engagement between the players and the

464
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,120
game to be able to discern more

465
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,799
information about what their competitors

466
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,919
are doing without actually knowing right

467
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,760
it's a lot of guess work um and then

468
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:05,159
they make decisions on whether they're

469
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:07,640
going to anti- up fold or um increase

470
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,120
the might go all in right I've

471
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,880
definitely got the winning hand we're

472
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,159
going to go all in and and and run with

473
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,919
this so that's what we're playing as

474
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,559
product management so understanding the

475
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,640
data collecting the data viewing the

476
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,360
data analyzing the data um some tools

477
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,360
for analyzing the data wow

478
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:34,200
um i t i prob is probably the big the

479
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,720
big big H tool um my background is in

480
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,600
the Microsoft space so I tend to know

481
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,640
the Microsoft solutions for these

482
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,559
problems um but I know a lot of people

483
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,320
like powerbi even when they're using

484
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:47,559
other platforms to store the data um but

485
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,200
powerbi to put all the data together um

486
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:54,320
probably things like app insights is

487
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
great application insites is Microsoft's

488
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,760
tool for collecting uh Telemetry it

489
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
supports open open Telemetry there's a

490
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,000
platform called open Telemetry that you

491
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,520
can use and you can store the data

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
wherever the heck you want um but it

493
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,280
enables you to collect and stream data

494
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,679
direct from customers that's your

495
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,480
Telemetry capture um yeah

496
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,919
this and this is part of the story right

497
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,960
so you've got you you've got your data

498
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,240
you've analyzed your data you've been

499
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,520
able to tell the difference between your

500
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,360
your um

501
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,880
what you think is happening versus what

502
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:39,799
you know is happening right you're

503
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,200
intuitive versus your actual data

504
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:45,320
and you need another tool you need a a

505
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,760
tool to

506
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,039
help enable your organization to more

507
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,520
quickly adapt um and sync through those

508
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:59,240
those processes so the the main tool

509
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,520
that I would use to collect data to

510
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,320
understand our processes right so it's

511
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,200
exactly the same as understanding our

512
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,960
organization we want to understand our

513
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,960
process that our team or our product is

514
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,960
is our operating model for our product

515
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,039
um and probably going to use a cand

516
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,720
metrics right that's going to give us um

517
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,840
quantitative data on what's going on

518
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,559
within our system that our teams have

519
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,240
created that are we've created within

520
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,200
our organization to handle work

521
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,679
um and then I want to make tweaks to

522
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
that system and be able to see in the

523
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,440
quantitive data that it's changing right

524
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,559
and and it's changing in a way that we

525
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,200
want it to change right we're improving

526
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,080
reducing our cycle time improving our

527
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,760
throughs all of those kind of things

528
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,840
right

529
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,279
so that's

530
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:56,799
great caman really allows you to model

531
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:59,039
any system right but there are tools out

532
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,120
there Technologies out there that you

533
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,720
can adopt that allow you to kind of jump

534
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:08,799
start that process cuz you might be way

535
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,679
over here on um my team every team in my

536
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,480
organization made up their process and

537
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,039
every member of every team does their

538
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,120
own thing right that's that's that's a

539
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,600
pretty common place for most

540
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,000
organizations to be um and we want to

541
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,320
have a little bit of standardization

542
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,080
while enabling the teams to be free to

543
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,880
do those things that we've standardized

544
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,320
in any way they choose um this the same

545
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,840
idea that that Microsoft talks about one

546
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,640
es one engineering system that's as your

547
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,039
devops right um and this idea that you

548
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,520
have one place to store all the stuff so

549
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,720
everybody knows where to go look

550
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,120
everybody knows how to go set things up

551
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,720
in that thing um so we're when an

552
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,760
engineer moves from one product to

553
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,000
another product they're not going and

554
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,000
hunting for well where's the automated

555
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,720
builds what technology is this I need to

556
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,600
learn a new new technology to even

557
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,520
change and understand this automated

558
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,200
build you don't have to do that we

559
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,039
understand that stuff already and then

560
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,600
it's just looking at how does it

561
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,559
actually run right um and then we can

562
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,000
jump start our people coming into that

563
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,640
process and the same is true in process

564
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,880
like 1es for our actual Engineering

565
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,440
Systems um scrum is a social technology

566
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:32,840
for our social systems right so we can

567
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:35,720
jumpstart our um move towards agility so

568
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:40,360
doing scrum doesn't mean you're agile

569
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:44,159
right we want to improve our systems and

570
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:48,200
scrum can be a good

571
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,520
application to say here's our bounded

572
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,360
environment right so that when if you're

573
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,159
familiar with cotter's Change Model you

574
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,240
create a bounded environment for for

575
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,159
change so you create a set a set of

576
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,880
principles that are going to guide that

577
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,640
change and perhaps there's some rules in

578
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,440
there at the start right we need a set

579
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,640
of rules to get people started so that

580
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,440
they're then following the principles

581
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,760
and then we start taking away like you

582
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,559
don't have to do this you don't have to

583
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,279
do that right you know when you were new

584
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,000
at this you had to do it this way you

585
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,880
know like training wheels on your bike

586
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,679
and then you can take the training

587
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,559
wheels off and suddenly you're riding

588
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,360
your bike on your own um and that

589
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:30,200
that if you look at the scrum guide it

590
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:33,279
has a literal a literal set of of rules

591
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:37,279
but it's based on a set of

592
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,760
principles so the rules are not a must

593
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,159
the principles are a must if that makes

594
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,240
sense in the scrum guide but the rules

595
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,559
are there

596
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,279
because most teams especially when they

597
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,720
start out especially when they're coming

598
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,799
from something else need an example of

599
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,919
how to start doing something and once

600
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,679
they are doing that thing and doing that

601
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,799
thing well and understand why those

602
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,480
particular structures are in place they

603
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,679
can then start doing something different

604
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,600
from those Pol particular structures in

605
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,760
order to still fulfill the same outcome

606
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,600
right from the principles so that's why

607
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,080
I talk about scrum as a social

608
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,080
technology we've got our our our

609
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,000
engineering you know one es one

610
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,440
engineering system what is your 1es your

611
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,480
one engineering system that helps um

612
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,720
from an engineering perspective Ensure

613
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,039
that everybody in your organization um

614
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,399
is able to move between different

615
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:35,679
products is able to help each other and

616
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,919
collaborate with each other share

617
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,960
knowledge and and and and ideas because

618
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,000
they're all working within the same

619
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,760
relative context even though how they

620
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,600
actually do stuff is completely up to

621
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:52,600
them um and scrum is that

622
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:56,679
social one social technology right um

623
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,480
around which you can allow people in the

624
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:03,120
teams to do what they do however the

625
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:06,720
heck they like right um but have a small

626
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,679
set of here's some some points at which

627
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,159
uh we engage with you

628
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,480
which leadership engages with the teams

629
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,640
the teams engage with leadership

630
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,880
engaging with the customers we have

631
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,600
those kind of touch points but within

632
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,480
that they can do whatever they want um

633
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,840
so evidencebased

634
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:32,120
management is really your lead into a

635
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:36,000
whole whole bunch of things that we can

636
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,320
do really really well and to understand

637
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,679
how we're doing things so you can apply

638
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,840
evidence-based management to your

639
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:44,880
business you can apply evidence-based

640
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,640
management to your product you can apply

641
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,480
evidence-based management some of the

642
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,200
metrics to an individual team and you

643
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,159
can figure out what's happening with

644
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,360
your system how your business is

645
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:59,720
organized and then when you make changes

646
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,559
to that system you can see it's the

647
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,440
empirical data that you need to

648
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,720
understand not just your engagement with

649
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,960
the market and your engagement with your

650
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,600
users but how your people are engaging

651
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,760
and your products are delivering within

652
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,640
that market so that you can adapt your

653
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,080
strategic uh uh intermediate strategic

654
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,919
and tactical

655
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,600
plans in

656
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,919
order

657
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,799
to have a success uccessful business

658
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,880
build the best product possible and and

659
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,880
generate lots of money
