1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,440
when scrum

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,519
Masters

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:09,480
don't have an

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,160
understanding of

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,799
both the the

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,359
philosophies theories and practices

7
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:21,320
within the context of the

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,760
team and an understanding of what the

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,640
team does every

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
day the

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,719
impact on those teams and those

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440
organizations is

13
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:40,360
profound they're not going to

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,360
improve right if if you took

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:49,399
uh if you you had a coach for a soccer

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,480
team that didn't understand soccer had

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,440
never played

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,160
soccer how

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,079
effective would they

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,120
be at coaching that team in the

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,879
processes and practices that you need

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,799
now

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,520
immediately a bunch of folks are

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,520
thinking but Ted lasso did

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,080
it you got to remember Ted lasso is a

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,560
fictional character and that fictional

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,600
character runs off a script and the

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,880
script works because plot so he's a good

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,079
coach because and successful coach sorry

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,479
because

31
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,560
plot right not because it would work in

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,640
the real

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,119
world every

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,960
almost

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,360
every

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,280
successful

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
coach for a sports

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,079
team

39
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,520
understands

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
fundamentally how that sport

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,439
works the

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,799
training the specific training

43
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
techniques that need to be done in order

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,000
to

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,159
maximize the capability of that team

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
right if they

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,640
don't they have sub

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,160
coaches right that

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,720
help for a specific thing like I think

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,879
in American football you have an

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,160
offensive coach and a defensive coach

52
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,560
and then you probably have an overall

53
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,280
coach and the overall coach might have a

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,879
different skill set from the offensive

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,440
and defensive coachies

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,720
right but they have a fundamental

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,360
understanding of the sport its rules uh

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,560
the the training techniques the types of

59
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,680
muscles that are used by the team and

60
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,599
how they can train those muscles to be

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,840
as effective as possible how they

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,800
prevent injury all of those sporty

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,080
things and that's what we're talking

64
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,599
about when we talk about uh competence

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,200
of of scrum Masters they need to

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
understand if they're a scrum Master for

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,239
an engineering team they need to

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
understand all the engineering team

69
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,440
things that they the team needs to be

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,640
able to learn

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,239
practice uh do change in order to become

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,959
more effective and if that's not there

73
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:11,519
they won't change if you have somebody

74
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,280
who is

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,959
just a um professional

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
coach right and perhaps taking a two-day

77
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,319
scrum Master

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,720
Class

79
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:27,360
typically what you will

80
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:31,760
see is very little actual Improvement in

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
the team's ability to deliver product

82
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,040
they might be better at engaging with

83
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,799
each

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,760
other but are they actually better at

85
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,760
delivering product because that is what

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,000
your business cares about they want

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,040
product they want working usable product

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,439
that solves business problems that's

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,239
what we're here for that's what we're

90
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,599
paid for that's the outcome they want to

91
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,560
improve have these scrum Masters

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:03,799
actually improved

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,879
that is is that what we're measuring at

94
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,200
all the lack of basic

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,879
skills around scrum

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,759
Masters results in an

97
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,440
organization's

98
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,320
continued um status quo which is likely

99
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,560
an inability to deliver which is why

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
they brought in scrum Masters in the

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,880
first place because building software is

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,840
hard building building products that

103
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,240
don't exist yet is

104
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,680
hard are we making the right bets are we

105
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,600
um using the right philosophies in how

106
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,639
we build our product how we design our

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,560
features how we get our features in

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
front of our customers how we engage

109
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
with the rest of the

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,919
Business Without understanding all of

111
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,440
those things we're not we're not going

112
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,840
to be able to help the team be effective

113
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,360
we're going to have them I don't know

114
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm being factious B sitting doing some

115
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,560
Lego team building exercises and perhaps

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,800
building a bridge with spaghetti and

117
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,680
straws right which which sure might be

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
great for for for a team building

119
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,360
exercise like Myers Briggs right I've

120
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,199
done some Myers Briggs exercises with uh

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,919
uh teams I've worked on for

122
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,039
organizations I've worked with and it's

123
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:29,759
a great team building exercise um but

124
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:33,800
it's of no value for delivery

125
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:36,790
there's only so much you can help a

126
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,160
team from the context of the

127
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,560
[Music]

128
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,560
team working together more

129
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,319
effectively but there's a massive

130
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,199
difference you can make by improving

131
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,840
their

132
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,639
knowledge right it's like it's like in

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,120
lean you you can you can make a certain

134
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,600
amount of um impact by looking at

135
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
reducing

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,400
batch

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,280
size right if you make the work items

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,919
smaller you're going to you're going to

139
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,440
improve the

140
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,639
flow but your biggest bang for your buck

141
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,400
is probably limiting

142
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,240
whip right that's where the highest

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,400
percentages a scrum Master helping a

144
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,000
team the biggest bang for your buck is

145
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,360
that scrum Master being able to teach

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,080
the team new skills and capabilities

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,720
that enable it to be more effective

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,639
enable it to build better products to

149
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,840
test more effectively have higher

150
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,560
quality these are the skills the primary

151
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,080
skills that you want your scrum Master

152
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,120
to have knowledge and

153
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,120
competence so that they can help the

154
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,639
team once all of those are awesome

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,360
perhaps at the same time right but once

156
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,319
all of those are awesome

157
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,400
and the biggest bang for our buck then

158
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,080
becomes because the team is already

159
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,280
awesome at engineering they have the

160
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,840
best devops practices they can they have

161
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,039
the best architectures they can in their

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,800
product they have the most effective uh

163
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,720
Engineering

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,039
Systems then if we enable the team to

165
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,120
collaborate more effectively we'll get

166
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,639
more stuff right that that's a small

167
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,680
percentage of the overall if

168
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,879
Effectiveness and we get that from

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,520
competence so organizations are

170
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,000
suffering because they don't have scrum

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,319
Masters that fundamentally understand

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,960
the work that needs to be done and how

173
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,960
to enable that work to be more effective
