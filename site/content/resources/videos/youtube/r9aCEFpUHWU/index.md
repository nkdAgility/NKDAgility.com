short_title: Competence in Scrum Masters Drives Team Success
description: Scrum Masters with deep knowledge and competence enable teams to deliver better products, drive business outcomes, and foster real improvement in software development.
tldr: Scrum Masters need deep knowledge of both agile practices and the technical work of their teams to drive real improvement in product delivery. Without this competence, teams stagnate and fail to deliver business value, while skilled Scrum Masters elevate team capabilities and outcomes. Development managers should ensure their Scrum Masters have practical expertise, not just facilitation skills, to maximize team impact.

When I reflect on my experiences as a [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master, one thing becomes abundantly clear: the effectiveness of a [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) hinges on their understanding of the philosophies, theories, and practices relevant to the team they support. Without this foundational knowledge, the impact on both the team and the organisation can be profound.

Imagine a soccer team being coached by someone who has never played the game. How effective would that coach be? The answer is simple: not very. Yet, I often hear the argument, “But Ted Lasso did it!” Let’s be real, Ted Lasso is a fictional character, and his success is scripted. In the real world, successful coaches possess a deep understanding of their sport, including training techniques and the physical demands placed on their players.

### The Importance of [Competence]({{< ref "/tags/competence" >}}) in Scrum Masters

This principle applies equally to Scrum Masters. If a Scrum Master is working with an engineering team, they must grasp the intricacies of [engineering practices]({{< ref "/tags/engineering-practices" >}}). Without this knowledge, meaningful change is unlikely to occur. A Scrum Master who has merely completed a two-day training course may facilitate better team engagement, but will they truly enhance the team’s ability to deliver product? That’s the crux of the matter.

- **What Businesses Care About**: Ultimately, businesses want working, usable products that solve real problems. This is the outcome we should be striving to improve. Are we measuring whether Scrum Masters are genuinely contributing to this goal?

- **The Status Quo**: A lack of basic skills among Scrum Masters often leads to an organisation’s stagnation. This is particularly concerning given that Scrum Masters are typically brought in to address the inherent challenges of [software development]({{< ref "/tags/software-development" >}}). Building products that don’t yet exist is no small feat.

### The Role of Scrum Masters in [Product Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/product-delivery" >}})

To effectively support their teams, Scrum Masters must understand various aspects of [product development]({{< ref "/categories/product-development" >}}), including:

- **Philosophies of Product Building**: Are we making the right bets?
- **Feature Design**: How do we design features that resonate with our customers?
- **Engagement with the Business**: How do we ensure alignment with broader business goals?

Without a solid grasp of these elements, Scrum Masters risk leading their teams into ineffective practices, think of team-building exercises like building bridges with spaghetti and straws. While these activities can foster camaraderie, they do little to enhance product delivery.

### Maximising Impact Through Knowledge

The real impact a Scrum Master can have lies in their ability to elevate the team’s knowledge and skills. In [Lean]({{< ref "/categories/lean" >}}) practices, for instance, reducing batch size can improve flow, but the most significant gains come from limiting work in progress (WIP).

- **Teaching New Skills**: The most effective Scrum Masters focus on teaching their teams new skills and capabilities. This enables teams to build better products, test more effectively, and ultimately deliver higher quality outcomes.

- **Collaboration and [Engineering Excellence]({{< ref "/categories/engineering-excellence" >}})**: Once a team has mastered engineering practices and [DevOps]({{< ref "/categories/devops" >}}), the next step is to enhance collaboration. This is where the Scrum Master’s competence truly shines, leading to increased productivity and effectiveness.

### Conclusion

Organisations are often hindered by the absence of Scrum Masters who fundamentally understand the work that needs to be done. It’s not enough to simply facilitate meetings or engage in team-building exercises. The most effective Scrum Masters are those who can bridge the gap between theory and practice, enabling their teams to thrive in a complex and ever-evolving landscape.

In my journey, I’ve seen firsthand how a knowledgeable Scrum Master can transform a team’s dynamics and output. It’s a reminder that competence is not just a nice-to-have; it’s essential for driving meaningful change and delivering value in today’s fast-paced environment.
