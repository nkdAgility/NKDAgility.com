1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,480
I think

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,580
my best day as an agile consultant is

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,760
difficult to answer so I'm going to

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,699
answer it in two different ways

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,100
my most memorable

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,960
moment as an agile consultant actually

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,680
happened

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,680
about

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,859
seven years

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,820
after

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:40,379
the engagement that it pertained to

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,140
so I I did a an engagement in in Utah

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,559
where we did some some training and

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,200
workshops and Consulting with a a team

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,719
of Java developers at the time I know

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,559
nothing about Java but Java developers

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,559
and

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,340
I mean I thought it went well we helped

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,320
them understand scrum we help them

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,539
understand agile we did some user story

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,540
workshops we did some engineering

22
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,400
practices workshops I I actually I did a

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,180
tdd

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,360
um

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,479
uh uh uh explanation and lesson and we

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,680
did a tdd Kata together even though I

27
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,479
was writing in.net because I know

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,860
nothing about Java and they were writing

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,439
in Java and they were still correcting

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,400
my code on the projector right

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,520
um

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,259
but but about seven years later I got an

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,500
email from one of the participants of

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,500
that

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,460
um just to let me know how much of a

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,220
game changer

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,159
that experience was

38
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,920
for him his team and the organization

39
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:50,939
and that that experience I think I was

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,360
only on site for five six days

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,119
um but that experience for them was a

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,939
felt like to them

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,159
as a catalyst for so much change inside

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,700
the organization

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,020
and I still speak to people that are

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,360
from

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,940
that engagement and hear from them on

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
occasion and they always they always

49
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,680
talk about it in in that way and I've

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,540
even I've done gigs for people that have

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,760
left and gone to other companies and

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,319
they've they've asked me to come in but

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,020
kind of nothing's compared to that one

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,560
which is funnily enough that was the the

55
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,440
first APS class I ever taught

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,420
