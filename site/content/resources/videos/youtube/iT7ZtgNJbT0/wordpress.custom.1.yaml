😅</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Even years later, people from that Scrum speak of it as a turning point. &nbsp;Some have even invited me into their new companies to recreate that magic.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But funnily enough, that first experience, the first APS class I ever taught, remains unmatched in my memory.🏆</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>But the true magic was seeing the long-term ripple effects of that short engagement. 🚀</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-your-turn-to-transform\">Your Turn to Transform</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Are you ready to experience the transformative power of Agile?</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Explore our Agile and Scrum courses. &nbsp;Because, who knows, it might just be the catalyst <em>your</em> team needs for a monumental change!
