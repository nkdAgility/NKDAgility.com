1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,680
really common mistake that agile

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,139
consultants make is just being cultures

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,200
and being a coach assumes that the

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,820
customer already knows and understands

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,279
what they need to do differently in

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,880
order to be successful and that is

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,820
definitely not always the case

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,820
um quite often if you're Consulting you

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,460
need to teach you might even need to

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,640
dictate right say do this differently

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,760
and try it differently you're definitely

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
going to be giving options right you're

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,420
definitely going to be suggesting

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,739
different ways to do things and helping

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,840
encourage those different ways and

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:43,920
organizations

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,480
um

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,500
the other way is going to make you more

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,840
money because you're going to be there

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,180
for longer but being a consultant is

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,780
about helping the customer not just

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,780
making money
