Really common mistake that agile consultants make is just being cultures and being a coach assumes that the customer already knows and understands what they need to do differently in order to be successful and that is definitely not always the case.

Quite often if you're consulting you need to teach you might even need to dictate right say do this differently and try it differently. You're definitely going to be giving options right you're definitely going to be suggesting different ways to do things and helping encourage those different ways and organizations.

The other way is going to make you more money because you're going to be there for longer but being a consultant is about helping the customer not just making money.
