# No go zone for agile consultants.

#shorts The transition from #agilepractitioner to #agileconsultant is often based on someone mastering the practitioner work, and being invited to teach and mentor others how to do the same, but it seldom involves coaching and mentoring on how to be a great #agileconsultant.

Most people learn through trial and error, and it can be easy to fall into some of the amateur cracks if you've never been taught or coached on how to excel in your role as an #agileconsultant.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about one of the primary mistakes he sees newbie #agileconsultants make, and what they should do instead.
