    "description": "In this video, we address compatibility concerns when migrating from TFS on-premises to Azure DevOps in the cloud. Many worry about potential issues, but the reality is that everything that works on-prem works in Azure DevOps, it’s the other way around where limitations may arise. We’ll go over what to consider for older versions of TFS (like TFS 2010) and tackle how to handle customizations, plugins, and extensions in the new cloud environment.\n\nYou'll also learn about important factors, such as maintaining on-prem build agents and ensuring your data integrity is secure during and after migration. With planning and some adjustments, compatibility issues are manageable, ensuring a smooth transition.\n\nVideo Chapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction: Compatibility Concerns in Migration\n00:31 - Handling Older TFS Versions (e.g., TFS 2010)\n01:22 - Ensuring Data Integrity and Security\n02:12 - On-Prem Build Agents and Cloud Connection\n02:40 - Managing Customizations in the Cloud\n\n👉 Watch the video to get expert insights on handling compatibility issues during your migration to Azure DevOps.
