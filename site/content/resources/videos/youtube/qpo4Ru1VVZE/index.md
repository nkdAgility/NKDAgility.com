When it comes to migrating from TFS on-prem to Azure DevOps, I often hear concerns about compatibility issues. However, I can assure you that if you're worried about these problems, you probably shouldn't be. In my experience, everything that works on-prem is compatible with Azure DevOps. In fact, the reverse is often true; not everything that functions in Azure DevOps will work seamlessly on older on-prem versions, which is where compatibility issues are more likely to arise.

### Understanding the Migration Landscape

Recently, I was involved in a migration project for a client still using TFS 2010. This version is quite dated and, as you might expect, it presented some unique challenges. Here are a few key takeaways from that experience:

- **Customisations Matter**: The client had several customisations—some they built themselves and others they purchased—that simply no longer exist in newer versions of TFS. This required us to plan carefully around what functionalities they would lose when moving to the cloud.

- **Upgrade Necessity**: Even a straightforward upgrade from TFS 2010 to a newer version would mean losing certain functionalities. TFS 2010 has been out of support for over five years, which means that companies still using it are at risk of data integrity issues and lack of support. It’s crucial to stay compliant to protect your organisation's intellectual property.

### The Importance of Your Codebase

Your code is not just lines of text; it’s a vital organisational asset. Here’s why you should treat it with the utmost care:

- **Safety and Security**: As you transition to the cloud, ensuring that your code can build your product safely is paramount. This is an expensive asset, and any disruption can have significant repercussions.

- **On-Premise Components**: Even as you move to Azure DevOps, you may still have on-premise components, such as build agents. The good news is that these can continue to function as they always have. The agents will connect to Azure DevOps in a one-way system, meaning they talk to the cloud without requiring any changes to your firewall.

### Customisations and Extensions

One of the most significant aspects to consider during this migration is your in-house customisations. Over the years, it has been relatively easy to create extensions, plugins, and other systems that integrate with TFS. As you move to the cloud, you’ll need to evaluate how these will function in the new environment. 

- **Planning for Change**: While it may seem daunting, addressing these customisations is manageable. With a bit of foresight and planning, you can ensure that your transition to Azure DevOps is smooth and that your existing functionalities are preserved as much as possible.

### Conclusion

Migrating from TFS on-prem to Azure DevOps doesn’t have to be a source of anxiety. With careful planning and consideration of your unique environment, you can navigate the transition effectively. Remember, the key is to understand what you currently have, what you might lose, and how to adapt your customisations to fit the new model. 

If you’re facing a similar migration, I encourage you to take a proactive approach. Assess your current setup, identify potential pitfalls, and don’t hesitate to reach out for help if needed. The cloud offers incredible opportunities for growth and efficiency, and with the right strategy, you can harness its full potential.
