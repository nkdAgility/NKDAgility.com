1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:08,080
if if you're worried about compatibility

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,280
problems once you've moved from TFS on

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,440
Prem to Azure devops um I probably

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:21,480
really wouldn't worry that much about it

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:24,480
um everything that works on Prem Works

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,199
in aure devops um it's more the other

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,880
way not everything that works in aure

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,199
devops works on Prem where there's more

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,840
likely to be compatibility issues uh but

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,480
there are certainly if you're on an

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,800
older version of Team Foundation server

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,160
um we did a migration recently for TFS

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,680
2010 and they had some

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,039
customizations that they built they had

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,039
some customizations um that they' bought

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,320
that are just no longer a thing um

17
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,239
they're no longer a thing in newer

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,320
versions of on Prem TFS uh so we had to

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,399
plan

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,600
around what are they going to do

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,000
differently

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,560
when they move to the new location right

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,320
um because even just an upgrade of TFS

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,400
they're going to lose that functionality

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,119
and they have to upgrade TF 2010 I think

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,960
was out of support five years ago maybe

27
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,280
longer um so they were they were really

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,680
hurting for for from that perspective

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,240
they need to you need to be in

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,520
compliance if you want support data

31
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,640
Integrity these are the systems that

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:34,520
hold your company's IP right um you you

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,720
you you need the the the the code to be

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,520
able to build your product um and that

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
needs to be safe and secure this is your

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,799
organizational asset if you're if you

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,560
have any building of software going on

38
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,759
this is a very expensive asset to to to

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,159
work on so you need to make sure that it

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,640
all works um as you move up to the cloud

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
um you will have still a bunch of on

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,960
Prem stuff going on you probably have on

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,079
Prem build agents you probably have um

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,520
other things locally those can largely

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,959
just continue to function as is uh the

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,120
agents will just connect to uh um Azure

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,599
devops in the cloud and it's a one-way

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,200
system so the agents talk to the cloud

49
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,239
the cloud never talks to the agent so

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,200
you don't need to punch any holes

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,120
through your firewall um and then you've

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,840
got to consider all of your own in-house

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,239
customizations that you've created it's

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:37,480
very easy and has been for oh 14 15

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:41,440
years to create uh extensions plugins um

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,519
other systems that bounce off uh TFS uh

57
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,080
so you'll need to take into

58
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,800
consideration what are they going to do

59
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,840
in um the new model of working with the

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,080
cloud these are all things that you can

61
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,400
just resolve they're they're not that

62
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,400
difficult
