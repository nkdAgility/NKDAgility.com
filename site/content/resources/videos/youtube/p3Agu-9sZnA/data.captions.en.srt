1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,960
technical debt it's one of those things

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,520
that creeps up on you slowly quietly

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,360
until suddenly you're spending more time

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,000
just keeping things running than

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,759
actually delivering anything new and at

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,880
that point it's not just slowing you

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,439
down it's actively getting in your way

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,160
so how does this happen well legacy

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,640
systems don't start out as a problem

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,439
they work they're familiar they've been

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,800
built up over time layer upon layer

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,640
quick fix stacked on top of old

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,280
workarounds at some point though making

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,440
even the smallest change becomes risky

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,440
everything is interconnected nothing is

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,879
well documented and nobody really wants

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,960
to touch it and yet the business still

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,440
expects progress customers still need

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
new features and your team they just

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,840
want to do good work without feeling

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
like every change is a

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,320
minefield this is where CTO's and

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,320
engineering leads hit a tough reality

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
you can't just stop everything and

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
refactor the whole system from scratch

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,720
the business won't wait and neither will

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,200
your customers that's why at Naked

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,240
Agility we don't tell teams to stop

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,320
delivering and fix their code instead we

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,400
help them change the way they work so

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
they can gradually refactor while still

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
keeping the lights on

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
it's about making better decisions at

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,439
the system level understanding what

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
changes will have the biggest impact and

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,200
how to prioritize them and making sure

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
that teams have the engineering

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,400
practices in place to actually improve

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,799
things over time without grinding

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
development to a

41
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,799
halt because here's the thing technical

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,439
debt isn't just a technical problem it's

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,000
a system of work problem and if you

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,320
don't change how decisions are made how

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,640
teams collaborate and how work flows

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,680
through the organization then even the

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,479
best refactoring efforts will lead to

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,079
just more

49
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,399
debt so if you're dealing with a system

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,439
that feels like it's holding you hostage

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,399
let's talk at Naked Agility we don't fix

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,399
the system for you we just help you

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,800
change the way you work so that fixing

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,800
it becomes a natural part of how your

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
teams deliver value

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,440
because in the end managing technical

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
debt isn't about rewriting everything
