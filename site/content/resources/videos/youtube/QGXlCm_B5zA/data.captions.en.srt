1
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,860
the question is what will you learn on

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,540
the PSM course

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,179
that's a great question I think there's

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,440
really two there's two main things that

5
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,820
you're gonna you're gonna learn on the

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,820
PSM course

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,260
that they Advanced PSM

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,880
um and the first one is uh and this is

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,380
for most people

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,480
that they've been doing this scrum

11
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,920
Master thing wrong

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,620
they've been focusing on the wrong

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,020
things it's not their fault quite often

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,760
they come in as a and I know many scrum

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,520
Masters that come in as a jira admin

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,559
right and that that then they become the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
scrum Master through being a beard Euro

18
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,760
admin and we kind of go back to our

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,559
default state right so we want to be

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
that jira admin because it's fun right

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,940
that's why you became well maybe

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,460
not so much fun in Europe but um you

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,320
became a uh that was your your thing

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,219
that you thought was fun

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,539
um

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:07,680
but the the that realization that

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,720
there's even more things that you need

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,860
to be looking at in fact the the jira

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,140
admin is something that should solve

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,820
itself right give give everybody on the

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,320
team admin rights to jira and let them

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,600
let them let them do it I know that

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,939
sounds crazy for to to authoritarians

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,220
but it that's pushing responsibility

35
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,920
down the organization teach the people

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,799
how to do the thing and then let them

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,360
get on with it and that leaves the scrum

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,100
Master free to focus on other things

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,659
what are the services that the scrum

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,100
Master is providing to the team what are

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,200
the services that the scrum Master is

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
providing to the product owner and

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,939
what's the services that the scrum

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Master is providing to the organization

45
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,720
and I think that's those those two to

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
the services the product order and

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,000
services to the organization are quite

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,420
often often missing and the services to

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,840
the team uh constitutes I was what's the

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,740
the age-old ones are you know protecting

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,740
the team

52
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,240
right uh uh why do you need to protect

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,820
the team can't they protect themselves

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,380
don't that doesn't the team have the

55
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,140
skills and knowledge and capability to

56
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,000
be able to say no to a customer right

57
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,440
that's what's missing not you don't need

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,260
to protect them

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,540
um or or doing the admin right updating

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,300
the tickets team can update their own

61
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,099
damn tickets you don't have to do that

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,360
um and and if you have to do it it's

63
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,780
like um

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,080
uh uh uh it's I I sometimes liken it to

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,900
to uh if you have if you have kids

66
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,239
and they've they've got an untidy room

67
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,160
you don't tidy it up for them

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,739
right because if you tidy it up for them

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,900
they'll always rely on you to tidy it up

70
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,680
and it will never be tidy unless you do

71
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,920
it

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,620
whereas if they have to do it and they

73
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,420
have to deal with the the the the the

74
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,280
the

75
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,440
maybe they'll take that plate down to

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,180
the kitchen because they know they'll

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
have to tidy it up later and it will be

78
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,540
nasty if they leave it if they just

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,180
slide it under the bed and leave it

80
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,640
right you know that bug you just kind of

81
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,379
slide

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,940
under the bed so you don't have to you

83
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,680
don't have to deal with it but if you

84
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,180
have to deal with it later and you have

85
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,800
to deal with the Fallout of it and talk

86
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,120
to the customer and why is it not fixed

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,519
and you have to do all of those things

88
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,900
you're more likely to go well I don't

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,000
really want that so maybe I should just

90
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,300
fix it I know it's I don't like doing it

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,860
but I'll just do it and that that that I

92
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,120
don't like the parenting analogy but I

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,159
think it works in that small

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,080
circumstance that you're trying to

95
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,640
enable a group of people

96
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,860
to

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,780
um be better at what they do to take

98
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,420
accountability for the things that

99
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,360
they're creating to deal with their own

100
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,659
stuff so that you can then focus on the

101
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,640
higher level uh uh uh things and

102
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,040
capabilities that that we want so that

103
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,159
the the improve the team's capabilities

104
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,720
improve the product owners capability to

105
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,400
deliver value to the business and

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,140
improve the businesses capability to

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,700
engage and interact with the team and

108
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,159
perhaps deal with organizational

109
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,720
impediments as well which is which is

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,739
very difficult to do especially from

111
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,420
where people think the scrum Master sits

112
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,840
um so that opening out of the scrum

113
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,580
master and being able to to

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,580
do greater things I think

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,359
