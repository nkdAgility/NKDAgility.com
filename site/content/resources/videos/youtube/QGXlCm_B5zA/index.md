{{< youtube QGXlCm_B5zA >}} 
 The #PSM II or #professionalscrummaster course from Scrum.Org is designed to help a #scrummaster progress in their career from entry-level capability to more advanced capabilities.

As a newbie #scrummaster, the focus tends to lie on helping the #developers through the #scrumframework and taking on a fairly strong administrative function within the team.

A #scrummaster role is far more significant than that, and so you need to develop the skills, capabilities and competence to serve the #productowner, the organization, and stakeholders/customers.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the learning outcomes in the PSM II course and why the advanced professional scrum master course plays a significant role in helping people advance on their journey to mastery.
