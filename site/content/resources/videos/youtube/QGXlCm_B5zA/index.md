When I reflect on my journey as a [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) Master, I often find myself revisiting the question: what will you truly learn on the [Professional Scrum]({{< ref "/tags/professional-scrum" >}}) Master (PSM) course? This is a question I get asked frequently, and I believe there are two main insights that emerge from the Advanced PSM course that can significantly reshape your understanding and practice of Scrum.

### The Realisation: You're Probably Doing It Wrong

First and foremost, many Scrum Masters come to the realisation that they’ve been focusing on the wrong aspects of their role. It’s not uncommon for individuals to transition into the [Scrum Master]({{< ref "/tags/scrum-master" >}}) position from roles like Jira admin. While managing Jira can be enjoyable—let’s be honest, it can be quite satisfying to organise and streamline processes—this focus can lead to a default state where the Scrum Master becomes overly involved in administrative tasks rather than facilitating the team’s growth and effectiveness.

- **Shift Your Focus**: Instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae of ticket management, consider empowering your team. Give everyone admin rights to Jira. Yes, it sounds radical, but this approach encourages responsibility and autonomy within the team. 

- **Embrace the Bigger Picture**: As a Scrum Master, your role should extend beyond the confines of Jira. You need to provide valuable services not just to your team, but also to the [Product Owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) and the organisation as a whole. 

### The Services You Provide

Let’s break down the services that a Scrum Master should focus on:

1. **Services to the Team**:
   - **Protection**: While it’s easy to think that the team can protect themselves, the reality is that they often need guidance. However, this doesn’t mean shielding them from every challenge. Instead, it’s about equipping them with the skills to say no to unrealistic demands and to manage their own workload effectively.
   - **Encouragement of Accountability**: Just as you wouldn’t tidy up your children’s messy room, you shouldn’t be the one updating tickets for your team. Allow them to take ownership of their tasks. When they face the consequences of their actions, they’re more likely to learn and adapt.

2. **Services to the Product Owner**:
   - **Facilitating [Value Delivery]({{< ref "/tags/value-delivery" >}})**: Your role is to enhance the Product Owner’s ability to deliver value to the business. This means helping them understand the team’s capabilities and ensuring that they can effectively communicate with stakeholders.

3. **Services to the Organisation**:
   - **Navigating Organisational Impediments**: One of the most challenging aspects of being a Scrum Master is addressing the barriers that exist within the organisation. Your position allows you to bridge the gap between the team and the larger organisational structure, facilitating smoother interactions and fostering a culture of agility.

### Expanding Your Role

The Advanced PSM course encourages you to expand your understanding of what it means to be a Scrum Master. It’s about moving beyond the administrative tasks and focusing on enabling your team to thrive. By improving the capabilities of your team, enhancing the Product Owner’s effectiveness, and addressing organisational challenges, you can truly embody the spirit of Scrum.

In conclusion, the journey of a Scrum Master is one of [continuous learning]({{< ref "/tags/continuous-learning" >}}) and adaptation. If you’re ready to take your practice to the next level, I encourage you to explore the Advanced PSM course. It’s an opportunity to not only refine your skills but also to transform the way you approach your role.
