The question is what will you learn on the PSM course? That's a great question. I think there's really two main things that you're gonna learn on the PSM course, the Advanced PSM. 

The first one is, and this is for most people, that they've been doing this scrum Master thing wrong. They've been focusing on the wrong things. It's not their fault. Quite often they come in as a, and I know many scrum Masters that come in as a Jira admin, right? And then they become the scrum Master through being a Jira admin, and we kind of go back to our default state, right? So we want to be that Jira admin because it's fun, right? That's why you became, well maybe not so much fun in Europe, but that was your thing that you thought was fun.

But that realisation that there's even more things that you need to be looking at. In fact, the Jira admin is something that should solve itself, right? Give everybody on the team admin rights to Jira and let them do it. I know that sounds crazy for to authoritarians, but that's pushing responsibility down the organisation. Teach the people how to do the thing and then let them get on with it. 

And that leaves the scrum Master free to focus on other things. What are the services that the scrum Master is providing to the team? What are the services that the scrum Master is providing to the product owner? And what's the services that the scrum Master is providing to the organisation? I think those two, the services to the product owner and services to the organisation, are quite often missing. 

The services to the team constitutes, what's the age-old ones? Protecting the team. Why do you need to protect the team? Can't they protect themselves? Doesn't the team have the skills and knowledge and capability to be able to say no to a customer? That's what's missing. You don't need to protect them. 

Or doing the admin, right? Updating the tickets. The team can update their own damn tickets. You don't have to do that. And if you have to do it, it's like, I sometimes liken it to if you have kids and they've got an untidy room, you don't tidy it up for them, right? Because if you tidy it up for them, they'll always rely on you to tidy it up, and it will never be tidy unless you do it. 

Whereas if they have to do it and they have to deal with the fallout of it and talk to the customer and why is it not fixed, and you have to do all of those things, you're more likely to go, well I don't really want that, so maybe I should just fix it. I know I don't like doing it, but I'll just do it. 

And that, I don't like the parenting analogy, but I think it works in that small circumstance that you're trying to enable a group of people to be better at what they do, to take accountability for the things that they're creating, to deal with their own stuff so that you can then focus on the higher level things and capabilities that we want. 

So that the improve the team's capabilities, improve the product owner's capability to deliver value to the business, and improve the business's capability to engage and interact with the team and perhaps deal with organisational impediments as well, which is very difficult to do, especially from where people think the scrum Master sits. 

So that opening out of the scrum Master and being able to do greater things, I think.
