all have all right moving swiftly on uh

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,000
this episode we were thinking about

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,840
stuff that was going down in the world

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,760
and we thought it would be interesting

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,760
to discuss ethics and

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:58,000
Agility uh ethics being uh moral

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,519
principle of doing the right thing so

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,879
the understanding the difference between

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,519
right and wrong wrong and acting on it

21
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,760
and Agility being the whole movement

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,520
like all of it where Frameworks whatever

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,040
the industry that is become agile

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,439
helping organizations deliver better

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,000
value more

26
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:21,159
quickly is it possible for an

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,159
organization to be agile and

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,200
unethical have there ever been examples

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,320
of organizations behaving in an

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,040
unethical

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,280
way are there consequences to organiz

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:38,079
ations doing that um

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:42,119
discuss um what's your thoughts

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,600
Martin I I think it's a very um I think

35
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,520
it's a very gnarly issue because there

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,040
are loads of things

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
that people believe to

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,920
be

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,479
ethical that aren't or maybe maybe maybe

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,759
I'm wrong in the way I'm phrasing that

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,960
maybe there are just lots of people who

42
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,840
don't understand ethic that's possibly

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,680
possibly possibly what it could be

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,119
because I I think there's there's doing

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,319
things unethically and not understanding

46
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,120
that you're being unethical and then

47
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,599
there's deliberately doing something

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,200
unethical that you know is unethical

49
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,360
Okay so we've got conscious and

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,280
unconscious ethical Behavior yeah I'd

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
also like to call out that you use the

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,599
term Nar in the context of complex as

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,879
opposed to Nar as in cool um oh I did

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,959
not know I had another I was thinking

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,319
Nali in um certain uh subcultures means

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,280
really cool okay was not aware of that

57
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,080
that's age thing I'm not sure well I

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,519
think I'm older than you so yeah thanks

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,239
for that

60
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,840
um all right so do you think most

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,840
businesses operate with a moral

62
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,440
compass oh not sure I like that word

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,840
most

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,120
well I'm putting some uh well should do

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
you want me to Rattle through the

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,879
businesses that have at one time or

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,000
another executed a poor or ambiguous

68
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,519
moral choice that I'm aware

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,080
of sure I could probably maybe I could

70
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,440
add to that list or maybe I'm just

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,280
thinking of the same companies as you

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,480
are yeah okay um so Ford with their

73
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,040
Pinto release they consciously released

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:37,080
a car that would probably cause deaths

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,879
um the Ford Mundo pulled to the left

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,840
under heavy breaking uh Rena with the

77
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:46,799
Bonnet catch that would fly up

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,879
okay um how about Exon right we really

79
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,079
want to like this will get everybody uh

80
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,480
running for covers uh really dangerous

81
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,840
one Exxon had evidence that the oil

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,760
industry would cause climate change in

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,439
1970 and pay

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,920
to suppress the information and

85
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,480
discredit the

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,079
information

87
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,280
yep

88
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:14,840
I Y there is climate change Exon one of

89
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,160
the biggest o companies knew about it

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,959
actionably invested in misinformation

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,320
around

92
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,240
it yep I'm pretty sure the tobacco

93
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,240
companies can be put on that list as

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,160
well for the same same style of action

95
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,360
yeah at a certain point they became

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,919
aware

97
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,600
that smoking wasn't so good for you

98
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,520
right yep gone with the adverts that

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,199
dentist put out that smoking was good

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,880
for you and doctors that helped you with

101
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,600
your asthma

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,080
right um how about this um diabetes and

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,680
sugar addiction kills three times more

104
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,800
people than smoking in

105
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,960
America and it's heavily regulated in a

106
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,080
way that promotes

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,320
it corn syrup is

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,639
in everything everything

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,039
us

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,120
um what about uh zoom's changing of its

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,960
uh user policy that if you continue to

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,520
use zoom you agree for it to sample some

113
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,400
of

114
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:25,280
your right that was the the update was

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,600
that um they would be able to consume

116
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,919
all of use have their AI consume all of

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,520
that content to learn off your your

118
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,600
conscience

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,240
interesting well here's here's a here's

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,440
a personal beef of mine I got autobanned

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,160
from playing Call of Duty by installing

122
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,240
a new

123
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,240
mouse so Activision have banned my

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,199
profile from playing Call of Duty

125
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,720
because I installed Logitech Suite of

126
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,759
gsync

127
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,240
and it's on a ban list and so my my

128
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,800
account got banned which means I'm not

129
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,720
able to use a product not not for

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,240
cheating but Logitech uh Activision

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
don't tell you that you can't use that

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,919
or corsair's IQ or a couple of other

133
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,560
things and they known false positives

134
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,560
but because they're making so much money

135
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,199
they're not adopting their Ricochet

136
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
system and they just autoban people it's

137
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,360
it's a thing is that ethical take

138
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
someone's money and then ban

139
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,039
them yep that's

140
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,639
bad um

141
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,759
so what about boing what about

142
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,479
boing uh

143
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,479
boing um

144
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,280
deliberately made a business choice to

145
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,800
focus on shipping rather than

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,479
quality are you talking about the 737

147
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Max 737 Max is definitely so allegedly

148
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,080
allegedly we have to use that term

149
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:10,039
otherwise we'll be bankrupt um I this is

150
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:12,080
a I'm I'm very keen on Aviation um the I

151
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,039
think the ethical challenge is Boeing

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,479
very much knew the behaviors of the 737

153
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,599
Max and they made a particular feature

154
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,440
optional and didn't educate about it

155
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,599
you'll find the airlines that suffered

156
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,000
those crashes did not educate their air

157
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,400
crew properly on the operation of the

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,400
equipment uh yes however they we're not

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,919
told that there was a change to the

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,360
operation equipment um yeah allegedly so

161
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,319
yeah the there's there's it's it's

162
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,919
dubious ground right yep yep absolutely

163
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,080
do you launch a product that is

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,120
potentially

165
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,440
dangerous well we don't have all the

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,960
facts so um the Activision one I know is

167
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,039
true and you can't see me because you've

168
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,120
done it to me that's personal I didn't

169
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,479
cheat you banned me what's wrong wrong

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,400
um what about

171
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,120
meta um meta's harvesting of data from

172
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,240
since they bought WhatsApp well also

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,759
harvesting of data into C Cambridge

174
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,159
analytics as well right wow that's well

175
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,440
that's proven right because they paid

176
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:21,479
the fine yeah yeah yeah okay so U let's

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,280
stop before we end up being in some yeah

178
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,000
big trouble so that that's stuff that we

179
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,400
know about that we're picking up from

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,440
papers or personal

181
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,039
experience it's very easy for companies

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,000
either consciously or unconsciously to

183
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,200
behave in a pretty shoddy

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,959
way do you think they intended to do all

185
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,160
this stuff or is it some Curious happen

186
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,440
stance rush to go to

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:49,839
live I think it I think it depends from

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,279
which perspective you look at it I I I

189
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,279
do

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,279
believe

191
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,160
in all of those circumstances that we've

192
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,880
talked about if there was indeed

193
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,640
wrongdoing that takes care of our

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,160
allegedly right if there was indeed

195
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,640
wrongdoing somebody knew about it

196
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,000
somebody

197
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,800
understood the problem and the

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,360
ramifications and either chose not to

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,399
act or

200
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,760
chose to act in a way that had that

201
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,519
negative outcome

202
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
right what would drive that motivation

203
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,839
I'm trying to lean here into the the

204
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,200
whole curiosity with positive intent

205
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,959
because I don't think anybody gets out

206
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,560
of well the majority of people don't get

207
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,760
out of bed to just kind of break the

208
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,000
world right you're you're turning up to

209
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
work to do your thing and we're talking

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,800
about major corporations we're not

211
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
talking about you know organized crime

212
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,360
or anything because obviously there's

213
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,839
there's there's real intent there to

214
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,000
harm people um just make loads of money

215
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,200
um so with these major corporations what

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,880
could possibly influence somebody to

217
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,160
make a decision like that what what

218
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,360
would drive

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:13,320
them people tend to behave how they're

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:17,279
measured right so if somebody is under

221
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,800
significant pressure to deliver

222
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,519
something they

223
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,320
may cut

224
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:29,120
Corners um they

225
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,880
may falsify data there's been enough

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,880
number of cases especially in the

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,440
medical world where data on the the the

228
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,560
the the ramifications of of drugs either

229
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,760
um sweeping side effects under the

230
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,120
carpet or um making a drug look like it

231
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,519
works when it doesn't by fudging the

232
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,360
data and because people are put under a

233
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,200
lot of pressure to deliver something

234
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,279
yeah yeah

235
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,720
so it's what I'm hearing is that it's a

236
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,560
financial impact comperative right

237
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,079
because medicines in particular are

238
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,399
horrendously expensive to come up with a

239
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:11,240
new one yeah so and that that pressure

240
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,480
to deliver that's that's what got um

241
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,240
cyberpunk 277

242
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,760
right did you hear about that game yeah

243
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,519
the game uh that had that that um issue

244
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,000
so there's an interesting example with

245
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,959
cyberp Punk

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,279
277 perhaps not ethical but an example

247
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,000
of releasing a product too

248
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,240
because of that that Financial

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,600
imperative and there's documented

250
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,480
evidence on YouTube of developers

251
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,720
showing what the flaws were product were

252
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,079
desperate to hit a particular release

253
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,839
date and it it didn't it wasn't working

254
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:51,680
so well sometimes there's a lot of money

255
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,600
on their line right that that they're

256
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
going to start losing a lot of money if

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,720
they aren't able to actually release the

258
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,399
product um and and those ramifications

259
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,440
put people under a lot of pressure um I

260
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:13,199
imagine for examp example that was the

261
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,079
the driving factor for Zoom at the start

262
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:19,279
of the pandemic right where they they

263
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,120
deliberately

264
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,560
made I don't know if I have to say

265
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,120
allegedly for that one allegedly made

266
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,680
changes in the product in order to

267
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,199
increase the stability and scalability

268
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:38,920
of the product but reduce users

269
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:41,839
security um and not to tell users and to

270
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,920
actively um I don't know how to describe

271
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,360
it what is it when you create a

272
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,399
situation where it looks like it's doing

273
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,320
the thing but it's not doing the thing

274
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,360
masking masking masking the fact that

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
they they had done it um the the

276
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,040
endtoend encryption and you still had

277
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,480
the green light even though they turned

278
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,560
the encryption service on off

279
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,120
behind the scenes in order to support

280
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,279
more users because I think for

281
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,880
encryption you lose about 40% of your

282
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,160
performance right with encryption on so

283
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,880
that gave them that boost but instead of

284
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,199
making it transparent and clear uh to

285
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,560
the users that that's what they were

286
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:24,560
doing you know and for the reason right

287
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:26,880
um it was kind of all hidden um which is

288
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,360
unethical okay

289
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,079
um is it possible

290
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,519
to work in a professional agile

291
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
way and be

292
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,320
unethical I

293
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,480
don't

294
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:51,240
remember reading anything

295
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,440
in the agile

296
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,440
Manifesto that

297
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,440
guarantees

298
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:06,199
ethics it focuses largely on teams

299
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,680
collaborating and delivering value to

300
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:11,639
the

301
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,480
customer so defining your Market

302
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,519
segment uh your target audience and your

303
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,920
customer could allow some ambiguous

304
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,360
behavior and you could apply all the

305
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,440
principles of the ago Manifesto in an

306
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,199
unethical industry so let's push it to

307
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,360
the extreme um fishing centers they're

308
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:35,160
huge right there's organizations around

309
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,519
the world that um massively Target

310
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,839
fishing emails fishing texts you know

311
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,920
the WhatsApp scams the

312
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:46,079
um they they blanket hundreds of

313
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,959
millions billions of people and they

314
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,680
need a very low bite rate to actually

315
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,480
make themselves profitable that's that's

316
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,839
how the crime Works y um they're

317
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,480
amazingly responsive right every time

318
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,880
you know they the the in yeah they're

319
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,639
they're they're it iterating almost un

320
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,040
real time on the the the the copy the

321
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,959
opens the links the security people are

322
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,240
uh blocking their stuff and they're

323
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:17,920
continuously iterating I don't know how

324
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,279
many emails I get with fake remittance

325
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,959
advice or as a company right you get

326
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,920
fake remittance advice you get all all

327
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:28,000
these things that some of them look like

328
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,639
legitimate emails like somebody just

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,560
asking you question but even if they're

330
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:37,519
just fishing for you to click a link and

331
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,959
validate that the email is actually a

332
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,680
real email it's still a fishing attempt

333
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,560
right yeah yeah and then there's uh your

334
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,440
Amazon account's going to be closed is

335
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,240
the latest one that's heading my inbox

336
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,920
um uh

337
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:59,160
your security software subscriptions out

338
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:01,680
of date um you know your could send that

339
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,040
out for your your your Microsoft

340
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
security subscription and you're going

341
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,600
to hit a large body of people who who

342
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,920
are like that could be me right yeah

343
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,000
yeah yeah and you just need that little

344
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,079
bit of uncertainty so billing has

345
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,360
expired yeah yeah you're going to lose

346
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,759
everything um so what we're saying is

347
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,079
that you can apply the product aspects

348
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,160
of

349
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:31,560
agility in any context at

350
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,639
all and so really is up to you driving

351
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,000
the product

352
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,800
process to choose to act in an ethical

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,759
way or not and I know in the in the PSM

354
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,600
course for instance we explore an an

355
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:46,120
ethical issue where you misrepresent

356
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,839
what can be done at a certain amount of

357
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,160
time yeah yep um which is ethical and we

358
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:55,440
tease that out in the psm3 assessment as

359
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,319
well so

360
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,800
that need for uh awareness

361
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,920
of ethical behaviors there there's

362
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,919
nothing in the the guide books the

363
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,760
Frameworks the rules of agile that says

364
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,919
you need

365
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:14,199
to do do good for the world right well

366
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,000
sure and I think it's it's definitely

367
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:21,880
interesting so I have

368
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,199
um my my MVP my Microsoft most valuable

369
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,559
professional comes with an

370
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,440
Ethics guide like uh uh you you agree to

371
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,080
comply by these these epics as part of

372
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,360
this this

373
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:42,880
award um but I think I I do remember I

374
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,520
do remember a time uh me many many years

375
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,559
ago I think I was on the job

376
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:54,880
maybe was it my second second

377
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:58,039
gig um 2001 2002 around that time and I

378
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
was working for as shows my age as a new

379
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,440
media

380
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,200
agency right before uh just after the

381
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:10,480
dot bubble burst um and I was asked I

382
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:15,600
had a um so I was probably

383
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:19,360
22 and I was asked to um create an

384
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:24,200
application that took in a list of uh

385
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,840
first name surname and Company um and

386
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,919
generated guest at what their email

387
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,720
might be based on comp common company

388
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,559
formats um and then emailed those emails

389
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,320
with a you know in those days you could

390
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,280
really do the opened right because there

391
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,600
wasn't so much security around it um to

392
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,440
to to find people's email addresses I

393
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,320
was that's one of the things I was asked

394
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,200
to do um at the company I was at and did

395
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,240
you do no I ref I refused to do it

396
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,320
absolutely abjectly refused to do it and

397
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,880
I kind

398
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,600
of

399
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
I I I I lied about why I didn't want to

400
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,320
do

401
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,400
it so I didn't want to do it because I

402
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,640
thought it was unethical that's why I

403
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,200
didn't want to do it but at 22 I don't

404
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,559
think I had the balls to say I don't

405
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,760
want to do this because it's unethical

406
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,400
yeah because if I say that it implies

407
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,919
that I think the other person's being

408
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,240
unethical right Jud yeah yeah that could

409
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,960
that could be that could be an

410
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,360
accusation and it was the the Sales

411
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,480
Direct that was asking me to do

412
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,760
it but what I did

413
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,159
see which I guess kind of didn't really

414
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:44,679
get around that but um I I think I was a

415
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,120
BCS member British computer Society M

416
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,799
and the British computer Society also

417
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,880
comes with a with an Ethics ethics guide

418
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:57,679
I think my membership had expired at

419
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,760
this point right but I claimed that my

420
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,520
my my contract my membership of the BCS

421
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,640
was based on compliance with a set of

422
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,120
rules and I said that this this would

423
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,039
break that set of rules so I wouldn't be

424
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,760
able to do it um so that's a

425
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:17,280
really good practical

426
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,039
tip is regardless of your organization

427
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,120
like if if you're a a computer person is

428
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,880
there a computer organization like the

429
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,080
British computer society that has that

430
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,640
code of ethics I know as professional

431
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,480
scrum trainers we've got a code of

432
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,880
ethics as an MVP you've got the code of

433
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,280
ethics if you do any coaching training

434
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,640
there's coaching ethics from the ICF if

435
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
you do facilitation stuff there's ethics

436
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,520
there

437
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,760
is whatever your profession is there

438
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,480
will probably be a professional body

439
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,159
that can offer you a code of

440
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,600
conduct to help you negotiate your way

441
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,120
through the moral

442
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,120
mace yeah because I not

443
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
everybody

444
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,919
I'm just I'm thinking that's why I

445
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,679
paused not not not

446
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,880
everybody has the same ethical

447
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:15,039
boundaries I think well there's there's

448
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,279
some there's some grounds that is very

449
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,640
personal right and we see that um being

450
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,440
played out in society like you uh

451
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,360
there's

452
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,039
very strong issues that they generate

453
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,440
really really strong response and some

454
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,480
of it's supported by the media some of

455
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,960
sure but some of it's just just some of

456
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,960
it some of it's supported by by other

457
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,240
things that people ascribe to that they

458
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,799
feel that other some things are

459
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,919
encroaching we're trying to avoid saying

460
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:51,000
you know religion and various bits and

461
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,600
Bobs right but are things that are

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,799
antagonistic what's societal Norm versus

463
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:01,960
my group norms and how how how do they

464
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,039
mush together and what do I what what do

465
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,120
I follow and what do I try and impose

466
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:11,480
upon others right person personal Ms

467
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:14,720
personal beliefs right

468
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,960
yeah however they come about right yeah

469
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,039
it's it's like how do how do you well

470
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,480
it's up to you how you balance that um

471
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,679
obviously you'll make a choice when you

472
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,640
join and work for certain corporations

473
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,000
that work with certain

474
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,279
industries um I know some people would

475
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,880
choose not to work with

476
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:39,600
tobacco for instance energy companies

477
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,240
um defense manufacturers other things

478
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,919
like that like there the people will say

479
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,919
no I'm not going to go and work with

480
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,000
them gambling is another one so some

481
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:50,279
people some people won won't work with

482
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,559
with gambling companies uh cannabis

483
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,600
companies in the states struggle uh with

484
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,080
their cash flow because they're many of

485
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,080
the credit card companies many of the

486
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,000
banks won't because it's federally I

487
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
think it was I don't know if it is just

488
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,320
now but last time I

489
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,480
was

490
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,600
exploring those ethical ideas or at

491
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,960
least Aon in news it was federally

492
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,480
illegal so none of the federal banks

493
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,120
would touch it but state-based it was

494
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,320
legal but the banks have to operate

495
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,480
across Federal boundaries and they had

496
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,039
all they they couldn't they couldn't so

497
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,960
they had all this cash on premises so

498
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,799
they were getting robbed right because

499
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,320
everybody knew oh they've got all this

500
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,440
cash and they can't because they can't

501
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,200
take cards so it has to be cash and then

502
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,919
they can't go put it in the bank because

503
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,159
their business can't do that so they've

504
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,840
got all this cash on the premises and

505
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:40,640
they were getting robbed so that's

506
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,120
that's

507
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,840
almost they're doing it for ethical

508
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,960
reasons they're their own personal

509
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:53,120
ethical reasons and causing an unethical

510
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,760
situation which is yeah it's the the

511
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,279
Curious conundrum you get when you have

512
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,880
you know legal ju the position that's

513
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,080
you know let's not go into yeah yeah

514
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,440
don't don't yeah we're not going to go

515
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:12,240
dancing down that rat hole

516
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,960
um um so we can be ethical how we behave

517
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,919
we can behave towards each other

518
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,960
ethically and be working on a product

519
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,600
that is arguably unethical by someone

520
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,480
else's standards there are

521
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,240
some grounds that some people would

522
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,279
argue that for instance working in a

523
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,120
fishing company uh not as in fishing for

524
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:36,480
fish but as in the fraudulent Fishing

525
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,760
Company um is the right thing to do

526
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,600
because often they're in disadvantaged

527
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,559
Nations it's a way for them to provide

528
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,000
for their

529
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,520
families uh it's that or sta so it's an

530
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,760
ethical choice they either do that or

531
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,000
the family staff so for them it's better

532
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,840
that they work for that you know that

533
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,559
that ethical choice to them it might

534
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,600
appear cut and dried to us that it's not

535
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,440
on but to them

536
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:07,760
them it's a way of stopping their loved

537
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:13,440
ones go hungry right yeah I think I

538
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:17,120
think I've always had a strong ethical

539
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,880
Compass of what I will and won't

540
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,240
do um that comes a little bit from from

541
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,919
Asbergers right folks with Asbergers

542
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,159
tend to be very it's it's it's either

543
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:33,399
true or it's not it's either FAL it's

544
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:37,360
true it's right or it's wrong right um

545
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:40,320
and I think that has set me in good

546
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,679
stead but also got me in a lot of

547
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:47,200
trouble as well

548
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,480
because I don't think refusing to do

549
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,200
that work when I was 22 inured me to

550
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,679
that company right no and that's an

551
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,720
interesting thing is that if something's

552
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,039
challenging your code of

553
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,000
ethics is it okay to

554
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,880
walk and I would suggest if something is

555
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
really against your code of ethics or

556
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,480
your

557
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,120
values the ethical and right thing for

558
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,240
you to do is to walk yeah and that way

559
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,520
you m at least you maintain truth to

560
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,279
yourself yeah well and it but it also

561
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,720
depends on whether like you might not

562
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,200
walk from the whole company but you

563
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,960
might just walk from that particular

564
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,399
situation yeah right cuz it might not be

565
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,720
a company ethics thing it might be a

566
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:36,880
specific situation ethics uh for that

567
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,640
particular company I feel like um it was

568
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,120
it was the whole thing I just didn't see

569
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,279
it from where I was if that makes sense

570
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:51,159
MH that it it wasn't wasn't an

571
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:53,720
unusual thing to happen um but also it

572
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,600
was the time 2001

573
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:59,039
2002 people didn't really necessarily

574
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,159
understand

575
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,440
not everybody especially if you weren't

576
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:06,919
an IT person right didn't necessarily

577
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,960
understand that that that ethical in the

578
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,520
software space because software's not

579
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,360
really been around that long I mean it

580
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,559
has been around what 70 or 80 years

581
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,000
right um

582
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,679
but everybody in the world needing to

583
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,559
understand software and the choices and

584
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,120
the implications is a relatively new

585
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:32,279
thing well um

586
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,000
having access to mass

587
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:37,080
data

588
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,960
having concerns like privacy like before

589
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,320
if you if you wanted to growing up I'm

590
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,320
not sure whether this thing growing up

591
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,080
in

592
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,039
Australia everybody had their name and

593
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,159
phone number listed in the phone

594
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:53,120
book yep because if you want to Define

595
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,120
someone you went to the phone book right

596
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,120
yep whereas now you actively work to

597
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,919
make sure

598
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,679
sure not in the phone

599
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,200
book and register it with in the UK

600
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,120
there's a telephone preference service

601
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,279
where you can register it and make sure

602
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,000
that your electoral role it's

603
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,320
acknowledged so that finance companies

604
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,600
know you're on the Electoral role but no

605
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,360
one else can find it out Y and it's

606
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,240
interesting the Electronic Frontier

607
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,640
Foundation they've been around since

608
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,200
before the internet was a big thing so

609
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,840
mid 90s the eff have been fighting for

610
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,080
trying to get balance on the internet

611
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:33,799
and to maintain some Fidel

612
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,880
but um how do we maintain the signal so

613
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,880
that it's greater than the

614
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,880
noise yeah I don't know is is the answer

615
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,679
I see a lot of

616
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:53,000
noise um and especially on on on social

617
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,919
media right

618
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,519
because I don't know I don't know I

619
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,559
don't know why that I think it's because

620
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,320
people are hidden as well people feel

621
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,039
like they can be unethical when there's

622
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,200
nobody there to judge

623
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,440
them that nobody knows who they are

624
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,720
right oh you've just triggered to me you

625
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,760
know how I think in memes and metaphors

626
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,640
right um two things popped up the the

627
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,240
classic XK CD uh someone is wrong on the

628
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,840
internet y there's the the comic where

629
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,159
you just look at that through your

630
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,600
favorite search engine it'll come up

631
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,799
like bang XKCD someone's wrong on the

632
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,840
internet and it's like I'm just

633
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:36,360
correcting somebody's wrong on the

634
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,480
internet and uh the other one is I think

635
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,760
because Mike Tyson who said it uh social

636
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,440
media created this space where people

637
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,240
thought they could talk nonsense without

638
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,679
getting a punch in the head yeah yeah

639
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,320
yeah you know something to somebody's

640
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,440
face and you say something so horrendous

641
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,440
that they could give you a punch in the

642
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:03,159
face so you you you there was that built

643
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:05,000
in res what people say that that

644
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:06,559
prevented you from from from doing that

645
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,559
people's faces but then on the internet

646
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,200
where it's a free-for-all and nobody

647
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:17,279
knows who you are and you can create a

648
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:19,360
fake account um it's it's very easy to

649
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,760
say things with no ramifications

650
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,679
whatsoever so what do people say when

651
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,760
there's no ramifications

652
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,840
whatsoever this is the what was it when

653
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,320
Microsoft put the AI bot up a few years

654
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,399
ago that it happened twice so the first

655
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,799
time they they they they built an AI bot

656
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,960
they connected it to Twitter and within

657
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:47,399
a few hours the bot became misogynistic

658
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,279
racist and aggressive and they had to

659
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:54,399
turn it off um and then they tried again

660
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,240
I think a couple of years later they

661
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,000
they'd work been working on these

662
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,519
filters for for a couple of years um and

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,480
they tried it again and it took 24 hours

664
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:06,039
this time to become racist misogynistic

665
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,960
and aggressive it was it was it was

666
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:14,720
threatening to come around and kill

667
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:16,279
people um within 24 hours and it's it ai

668
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,039
ai is not

669
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:21,679
AI

670
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:23,880
like it's a funny thing to say but a AI

671
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,279
that we have is not like AI in the

672
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:30,240
movies right AI in the movies is

673
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:34,360
artificial intelligence AI that we have

674
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,240
just now is um a an

675
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,399
interpretive system it's collecting all

676
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,279
of the data that exists within a

677
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,600
particular topic and then rationalizing

678
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:46,960
that down to what are the patterns in

679
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,480
that data and reproducing those patterns

680
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,000
right so it's it's it's a trained

681
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,440
suggestion engine it's not it's it's not

682
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,840
a yeah if if you suddenly think of

683
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:03,279
Terminator and a self-aware intelligent

684
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,960
identity walking around doing stuff or

685
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm I'm really old and and there was a

686
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,360
great BBC science fiction program called

687
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,440
Blake seven and there was a super

688
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,000
cool yeah yeah talks about Blake seven

689
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,000
yeah yeah so go and look at up it was

690
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,440
brilliant it was really well done um but

691
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,240
there was this superc computer called

692
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,320
orac which was this uh perspect box with

693
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,360
some lights in it and it was self-aware

694
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,720
right it was fully intelligent you

695
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,679
know Ziggy from uh Quantum

696
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,679
Leap I'll take your away for it missed

697
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,679
that one uh but yeah but that's why not

698
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,159
it's it's modeling right it's yeah it's

699
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:51,360
modeling so if you plug it into Twitter

700
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,240
the AI will reflect the sentiment on

701
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,440
Twitter so it became a racist

702
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,519
misogynistic horrible person right

703
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,600
because that's how people are act there

704
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,000
are there are people who are being nice

705
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,600
on Twitter but the majority of stuff on

706
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Twitter is people being nasty to each

707
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,840
other with no repercussions imagine it

708
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,559
if they did it now when a lot of the

709
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,240
checks and balances have been taken out

710
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:22,399
of X as it is now

711
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,399
known yeah I I and I

712
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,519
think if the thing I always think about

713
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,679
like the moral and ethical part right

714
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:32,600
should they be taking those checks and

715
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,600
balances out the the the the the the

716
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,639
part that I find more

717
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,559
interesting is

718
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:48,000
that H

719
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:49,399
humans also do some of what AI does

720
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,600
current current

721
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:57,279
AI is not doing what humans do but what

722
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:01,080
AIS are doing humans also do we we we

723
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,120
collect a bunch of information we uh uh

724
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,399
surf it for patterns pull out the things

725
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,679
that patterns that we connect with and

726
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:14,440
then that becomes part of ourselves

727
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,240
which is why we lazy load right we lazy

728
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,560
load and we generalize well it's it's

729
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:23,040
it's ultimately why uh magically we're

730
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,679
all we're always born into our religion

731
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,960
right that's the the the the thing where

732
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,720
the data we're absorbing

733
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,200
as we're growing up is the thing that

734
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,399
creates that that mental mindset that

735
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,720
we're in

736
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,399
therefore we're we're we're always in

737
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,320
the perfect religion for us because

738
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:43,879
that's the one we've been taught and

739
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,320
it's the same thing if if if you're

740
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:51,000
engaging with um a bunch

741
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:55,040
of nasty mean

742
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,200
people you're going to start talking and

743
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,400
acting in a nasty mean way well it's

744
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,200
that tribal drive right and if we yeah

745
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,320
okay so we we as humans have a desire to

746
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,960
be part of a group if we're surrounded

747
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,520
in a group that are behaving in a poor

748
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,599
way how do we become self-aware that

749
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,040
it's

750
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,280
poor and what do we do about the

751
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,720
situation so then this comes back to

752
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,800
ethics being subjective right the the

753
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,560
the what's what's one

754
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,160
person's bad

755
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,240
thing is another

756
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,400
person's it's fine

757
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,200
thing probably not not best words to use

758
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,079
but but there there's some general

759
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,079
trends

760
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,119
of of

761
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,000
what uh really poor behavior is and this

762
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,359
is where I you know reflect on asimov's

763
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,800
laws right yeah Mo most people

764
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,680
I probably feel comfortable with that

765
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
statement most

766
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,839
people are physically

767
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,200
upset when are physically affected in a

768
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,280
negative

769
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,359
manner when they

770
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,839
see another human or even another

771
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:25,599
animal being subjected to some kind of

772
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,960
pain right yep Mo most people are are

773
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,240
are upset with that and

774
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,000
even animal you you could see that in

775
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,119
the animal kingdom with each other as

776
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,280
well right they're they're usually

777
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,680
hunting to eat they're not yeah they

778
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,160
don't play with their food right yeah um

779
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,920
well except cats but they're Psychopaths

780
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,440
um yeah well this this is like cats and

781
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,760
humans are the only ones that torture

782
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:54,720
other things right yeah so that that

783
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,000
there

784
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,319
is inherent

785
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,440
moral and ethical rout sub

786
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:08,119
routines in humans that are triggered by

787
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,359
by those things that's probably part of

788
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:14,839
how animals survive right Humanity

789
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,079
survives is because we have helped each

790
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,960
other what was the the there was a a

791
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,000
lady she was a um

792
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Anthropologist and she was asked I don't

793
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,480
remember any of the names for this but

794
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,960
she was asked

795
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,280
um what was the

796
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:37,079
first indication that humans when when

797
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,319
when did humans become not animals but

798
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:40,720
uh uh uh sentient what was the first

799
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:44,000
sign of

800
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,480
sentients and it was a

801
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,720
uh a repaired broken

802
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:57,160
bone oh tools no so this is this is this

803
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,359
is yeah this is when we actually

804
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,160
look after a weak person right so when

805
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,200
we actually looking after a weak person

806
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,480
taking care of somebody till they're

807
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,599
they're bone had healed and then they

808
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,520
were able to be productive again and

809
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,280
that was

810
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,880
her moment that that that that's that's

811
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:19,200
what they're looking for when they look

812
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,599
back in in in history um for whether

813
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,680
this group

814
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,960
was sentent or not right so um I chall I

815
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,000
wouldn't say sentient but I'd say

816
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,760
civilized I'm the wrong words yeah so I

817
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,640
I'd say civilization that that was the

818
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,760
point that yeah the first say of

819
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,560
civilization you're right that's that's

820
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,240
that's exactly the phrase that I would

821
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,079
that I was trying to get to but couldn't

822
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,599
yeah thank you um so really if we're

823
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,760
thinking about it is basically that

824
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,880
first law of azimov which is um a robot

825
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,000
may not injure a human being or through

826
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,520
in action allow a human being to come to

827
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,240
harm so basically if we use that as the

828
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,760
ultimate

829
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,440
imperator that is the ethical boundary

830
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,680
but then immediately we're hit with the

831
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,599
Escape Clause of what if you're in

832
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,240
defense of your own and that is where

833
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:14,000
the military come into play because they

834
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,400
sure but

835
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,280
they're you know that's that's the in

836
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,680
extremist that's the straw man argument

837
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,640
right but dayto day most of us don't

838
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:27,880
have to go around and MIM or injure or

839
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,640
no not until theoc through we'll be fine

840
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,720
no so okay we're all good till the

841
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,839
zombie apocalypse yeah [Â __Â ] just has

842
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,520
to be any form of Apocalypse right yeah

843
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,800
so um well we found out through coid in

844
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,359
the UK that the first consequence of

845
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,359
Apocalypse is we run out of toilet

846
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,720
paper second consequence is I can't buy

847
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,079
a webcam that was the second consequence

848
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,920
of of Co yeah yeah I can't buy a chip

849
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,839
cuz uh for my graphics card cuz

850
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,960
everyone's crypto

851
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:07,200
mining everybody's crypto mining from

852
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,599
home yeah I think I think that that

853
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,680
that that

854
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,599
core moral and ethical code although for

855
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,520
some people it appears to be broken

856
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,040
right but in general for that core maybe

857
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,839
some people have overridden it they

858
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,079
still have it but they've overridden it

859
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:25,760
yeah um and some people definitely don't

860
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,760
have it that's for sure there psychop

861
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,319
that is

862
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,680
just statistically statistically a very

863
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,400
it's an extreme outlier they're beyond

864
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,040
the three standard deviations they're

865
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,079
the you know serial killers get a lot of

866
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:46,200
publicity because they're so rare right

867
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:50,079
yeah yeah than and yeah uh but the the

868
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:54,200
the beyond that people humans have an

869
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,760
inbuilt moral and ethical Compass which

870
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,359
means that if if if

871
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,280
somebody this is why you get

872
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,720
whistleblowers right people people are

873
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,240
making are making

874
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,720
decisions that go

875
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:14,480
against their moral and ethical and it's

876
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,640
learned or imposed Behavior yeah that's

877
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,240
overriding their

878
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,680
inbuilt and it's that sense of Do no

879
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,760
harm right and I think that's the

880
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,560
essence of the first law is we do no

881
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,440
harm we don't make the situation worse

882
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,200
for others now occasionally we will be

883
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,119
in a

884
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,319
system where that whole system is built

885
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,760
to take

886
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:45,240
advantage and at what point is the

887
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,319
checkout you know because ultimately

888
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,040
social

889
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,359
systems require some transactions some

890
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,560
people are going to come off better some

891
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:55,240
going to come off worse at what point do

892
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,680
you check out of the

893
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,440
system

894
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,280
yeah but also at at at what

895
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,880
point

896
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,560
do do the

897
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:14,240
rules imposed upon

898
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:19,040
people the system that's created

899
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:22,720
right um impose unreasonable constraints

900
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,720
so we we

901
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,119
create there's two forms of this right

902
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,160
one is one is obvious it's it's the law

903
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,520
right we create

904
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,520
systems to

905
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,280
impose and I'm using impose Loosely mhm

906
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:45,640
threat of punishment right so it's an

907
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,640
imposition to impose certain

908
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,920
behaviors yeah yeah Bas on societal Norm

909
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,480
right so yeah depending upon your

910
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,160
country that there's different policing

911
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,960
models to be very philosophical about it

912
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,160
and you know in a lot of the western

913
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,319
world it's policing by consent um where

914
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:10,599
they they're just a reminder some of

915
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:12,960
them um yeah okay Rat Hole Rat Hole Rat

916
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,839
Hole yeah yeah Rat Hole police by

917
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,760
consent versus police by enforcement

918
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:17,760
yeah

919
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,440
um there some social Ms or boundaries

920
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,480
they could be laws there could be some

921
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,720
social Ms or behavior codes um that's

922
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:32,359
the way our Tri RS um that that's like

923
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,359
my my MVP code of conduct or the BCS

924
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:40,280
conduct or the scrum.org C code of

925
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:43,119
conduct these are all um um they're not

926
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,920
expected I think the the the core thing

927
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,160
with those those types of things those

928
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,920
codes of conduct is that they're not

929
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,920
expected to be

930
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,920
broken right yeah like the doctor's

931
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,680
hypocritic o right just be the default

932
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,760
even if we didn't ask you anything even

933
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,839
if we didn't tell you about it we don't

934
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,599
expect you to do any of those things

935
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:06,800
yeah it's like here here table Stakes

936
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,559
don't be a dick yeah cuz I I I I I read

937
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,079
a lot of these codes of conduct and I'm

938
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,839
like yeah why would anybody do those

939
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,480
things just seems like a no-brainer that

940
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:19,839
that that you wouldn't you wouldn't do

941
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,760
those things but you know some of them

942
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,720
some of them are a little bit more

943
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,520
strict than others right um especially

944
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,280
when you that oh well that's probably a

945
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,559
rat hole as well

946
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,520
imposed

947
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,520
um how how what's the

948
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:47,440
word imposed speech right or

949
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,599
imposed uh uh ideas that you're you're

950
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,359
it's not necessarily A that core thing

951
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:54,160
but you're kind of forced to do that

952
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,839
thing there there's a few things like

953
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,480
that I've seen in codes of conduct

954
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:03,720
um that that maybe are starting to get

955
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,599
to that edge of that moral and ethical

956
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,319
is it ethical to to impose thought

957
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,280
on I'm using air quotes for thought but

958
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,160
impose thought on on on on other people

959
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:20,079
but um I guess pendulums right swinging

960
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,200
lots of different ways but I think

961
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,119
there's boundaries right and otherwise

962
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,520
we're going to go off on another segue

963
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,960
and start talking about the world of

964
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,319
Brave new world uh

965
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,920
1984 new speak you know the impos

966
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,680
thought and I couldn't help it but this

967
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,440
the way my weird brain works and you

968
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,640
know random connections firing off as

969
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,280
soon as you said policing by consent

970
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,319
policing by order you know good police

971
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,599
straight in my head Judge Dread walks

972
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:52,880
in yeah that and that that's that's

973
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,599
that's that ultim ultimate policing by

974
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:58,920
enforcement right yeah that you have

975
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,000
some some kind of societal this is the

976
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,079
whole side topic but you have some kind

977
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,559
of societal thing that changes which in

978
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,760
the Judge Dread Universe it's a it's ma

979
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,599
it's mass

980
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,920
unemployment because mechanisms are

981
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,000
taking over all of the jobs so there are

982
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,680
no jobs for people so if everybody's

983
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,040
sitting around not doing anything um you

984
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:27,040
end up with listless behaviors right

985
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:30,119
because people have no outlet for what I

986
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,119
want to do uh and then things can very

987
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:36,000
quickly get out of control and then you

988
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,960
need stronger enforcement of the rules

989
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,880
right that's and which ties into another

990
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,880
fantasy Universe because all the judges

991
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:49,280
are clients

992
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:52,200
um anyway all right so um just real as

993
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,079
back towards so ethics and Agility so

994
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,720
we' we've had a a wide rambling

995
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,319
discussion there have been evidence of

996
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,119
Corporations behaving unethically there

997
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,160
is clear evidence of people behaving

998
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:08,800
unethically some of it legally some of

999
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:11,079
it just not very nice y some of it

1000
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,319
alleged some of it

1001
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,000
demonstrated uh agility in its core when

1002
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:20,200
we look at the manifesto for agile

1003
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,400
software development there is an implied

1004
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:27,480
ethics in it but you can be agile and

1005
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,359
apply it in an unethical fashion for

1006
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:35,200
instance um fraudulent industry such as

1007
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:36,960
skimming fishing scams like that um well

1008
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,000
there might even be perfectly legal

1009
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,200
industries that a certain group of

1010
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,400
individuals believe is unethical right

1011
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,280
and that's contextual and up to for

1012
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,680
debate and that's why laws changed you

1013
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:53,760
know so um and that's that's fine that's

1014
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,920
the whole point of the legal systems is

1015
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,160
to uphold well it should be for the

1016
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,359
betterment of the the society and what

1017
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,079
have you without jumping into that um

1018
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:08,240
mess we not touching that

1019
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:10,440
um so then we thought about that and

1020
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,119
flipped it on its head and said well is

1021
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,920
it okay for somebody to work in one of

1022
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,800
those Industries if it saves their

1023
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,240
family and in that instance it may be

1024
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,319
ethical for them to behave like that we

1025
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,640
then sort of made a segue into personal

1026
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,440
ethics what does it mean to be a

1027
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,760
civilization

1028
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,640
and we thought about when we as a

1029
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,040
civilization look after the less

1030
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,680
fortunate we become

1031
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,400
civilized um and you said that the the

1032
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,160
Anthropologist was sorry we forgotten

1033
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,079
the name um defined the point of

1034
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,359
civilization is when the society

1035
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,319
became comfortable and capable of

1036
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:50,280
looking after an individual with a

1037
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:52,200
broken leg and that meant that they

1038
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,880
willing to expand the resources to look

1039
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,200
after that person for their uh healing

1040
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,799
and up until they could then become a

1041
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,839
productive member of the group again so

1042
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:05,040
that a civil society will look after

1043
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:08,079
people which will imply an ethical

1044
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,160
boundary we then explored professional

1045
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,079
organizations and their guides to code

1046
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:18,040
of

1047
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:21,559
conduct and we're then inviting you

1048
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,799
wonderful listener to think about what's

1049
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:26,760
your what's your values what's your

1050
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:29,760
ethics what's your boundaries

1051
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,799
yeah and and to and to consider how your

1052
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,880
ethics your boundaries apply to what

1053
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:38,880
you're actually doing every day and what

1054
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,079
are you doing in your organizations who

1055
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,599
are you working for what are they doing

1056
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:44,640
and does that fit within within within

1057
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,119
your ethical boundaries what have you

1058
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:51,680
been asked to do um and I I would again

1059
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:54,480
tie tie that back to that idea of of the

1060
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,720
squirrel burger that you mentioned right

1061
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:04,599
um of ask asking asking

1062
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:07,160
people to say and do things that they're

1063
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:08,000
not capable of saying and doing if that

1064
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,480
makes

1065
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,599
sense ask asking people to commit to

1066
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,160
something that's impossible for them to

1067
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:15,920
deliver

1068
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,760
yeah

1069
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,440
um which

1070
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,000
is a really important thing for agility

1071
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,200
well professional agility um for the

1072
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,520
professional cand professional scrum

1073
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,720
that we

1074
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:34,200
teach making sure that you have time and

1075
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,559
space to reflect so that you have the

1076
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,119
capacity to observe yourself and to make

1077
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,280
sure that you're honoring your code of

1078
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,839
ethics if you're practicing both of

1079
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,079
those either of those being able to use

1080
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:50,000
the force of the scrum values Focus

1081
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:55,079
openness respect courage and commitment

1082
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,960
Do no harm do good um be a be a positive

1083
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,160
influence uence on society in general

1084
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,400
and

1085
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,720
then what's what's the step so

1086
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,079
interesting say you suddenly realize

1087
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,799
you're in a bit of a dilemma and you're

1088
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,920
in a bit of a a moral

1089
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:13,680
maze what would you recommend for

1090
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,079
someone if they suddenly realize they

1091
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,880
come to the Epiphany that perhaps

1092
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:22,280
something they're doing is not quite

1093
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,359
good wow yeah what to

1094
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,319
do

1095
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:28,760
um

1096
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:32,319
depends on what it is right it depends

1097
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,440
on where what what what line is it that

1098
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:38,640
you feel that you're

1099
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,920
Crossing um perhap Perhaps Perhaps

1100
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,720
Perhaps you need to walk into your local

1101
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:46,559
police station right that could be an

1102
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:49,599
extreme case of of I I need to I need to

1103
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:53,640
do something I need to raise raise this

1104
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:57,280
um but perhaps it's just

1105
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:59,920
uh like I was asked to do one ethical

1106
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,920
unethical thing out of a bunch of things

1107
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,559
that I was doing and I just refused to

1108
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,559
do the things that I didn't think were

1109
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:09,760
were ethical and voiced that I felt that

1110
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,400
they were unethical right yeah yeah um

1111
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,440
that that could be enough for the person

1112
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,280
suggesting it to go oh oh actually

1113
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,799
you're right that's probably not a good

1114
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,839
idea right sometimes people do things

1115
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:24,680
unethically because they don't realize

1116
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:28,200
or they haven't thought through or or

1117
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,760
whatever we all have dumb ideas right um

1118
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:34,640
people jump offs onto trampolines right

1119
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:38,480
people have people have uh uh dumb ideas

1120
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,400
so perhaps just chatting about it with a

1121
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,040
friend see what somebody else thinks do

1122
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,040
two people think it's unethical or is it

1123
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,799
just one so right that that very

1124
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,040
practical first step is have a chat to

1125
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:52,079
someone and just

1126
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,200
validate yeah valid validate whether it

1127
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,240
is or it isn't before you go to the

1128
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,319
police station just check with someone

1129
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,319
else before you go there yeah and you

1130
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,040
you probably you you can probably assume

1131
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:05,480
that it's unethical if you're if you're

1132
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,960
asked to it in the phrase of don't tell

1133
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,760
anybody else

1134
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,000
but right I want you to do this thing

1135
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,319
that's probably a good indication that

1136
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,319
there's something fishy going on

1137
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:24,160
yeah so check with someone else yep give

1138
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,880
yourself time and space to think about

1139
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,599
stuff

1140
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,359
build your own set of

1141
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:33,359
values uh if in doubt use the scrum

1142
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:37,520
values until you build your

1143
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:39,440
own yep double check that your

1144
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,799
organization's values are aligned with

1145
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,920
yours and that you're working in

1146
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:44,280
Industry that you support and can

1147
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:48,880
comfortable live

1148
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:54,640
with um and

1149
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,760
just be be mindful right yeah always be

1150
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,480
consider

1151
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,640
ing the eth ethical ramifications of

1152
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,880
what it is you're doing and are you are

1153
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,960
you still on the right path are you

1154
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,880
still doing the right thing are you

1155
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,160
still um able able to live with yourself

1156
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,079
for the things that you're doing or are

1157
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,040
you going to be up all night worrying

1158
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,960
about making choices that you've made

1159
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,880
right and this is an important point is

1160
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,440
that the I think it was the engineer who

1161
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,599
wrote the code for the VW masking of

1162
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,799
emissions yes that's my favorite

1163
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,240
favorite

1164
00:54:22,799 --> 00:54:29,480
one D and the manager

1165
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:31,920
both wenton right yep the first he was

1166
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,200
the first person so I'm going to Cave at

1167
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,319
that one a little bit Simon um he was

1168
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,200
the first person to go to prison but he

1169
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,960
was also the lowest level person to go

1170
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,079
to prison so probably had the cheapest

1171
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,960
lawyers right so there's that as

1172
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,920
well you're not telling me that um

1173
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,760
there's a two-tier system in society

1174
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,079
where rich people get away with stuff

1175
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,520
because they can pay for better law you

1176
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,680
can afford more expensive uh lawy ERS

1177
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,359
then you have a greater chance of not

1178
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,960
being punished right I mean that's just

1179
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:05,280
a little bit of reality there that

1180
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,559
really shouldn't be there but it is um

1181
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,400
the the quality wise right quality of

1182
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:12,559
the service um but yeah the the the

1183
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,599
person who wrote the the lead developer

1184
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,680
who wrote the code um for for Volkswagen

1185
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,640
in the diesel Scandal was the first

1186
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,559
person who went to prison we we as

1187
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,880
software

1188
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:28,400
Engineers have a moral and ethical

1189
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,400
responsibility to do the right

1190
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,760
thing and I didn't

1191
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:38,359
know is not a defense for a moral and

1192
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:40,240
ethical ramification yeah nor is I was

1193
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:42,520
just following instructions or orders

1194
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,039
yeah I was just following orders is not

1195
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,319
a defense uh for doing something morally

1196
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,200
and ethically

1197
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,760
wrong and you know it's wrong if

1198
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,799
someone's going to get

1199
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,079
hurt and if you have to ask that

1200
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:55,920
question is it morally and ethically

1201
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:58,319
wrong probably probably probably want to

1202
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,240
want to consider it right so I just need

1203
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,440
to carate that thing about someone's

1204
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,799
going to get hurt there are certain

1205
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,400
industries that that's what you're doing

1206
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:08,480
so yeah yeah yeah there are certain

1207
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,720
industries where where where where

1208
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:16,920
that's that's that's the outcome

1209
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:20,839
yeah ultimately it's up to you

1210
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:23,559
and make the world a better place right

1211
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:25,559
it's in your gift so you can be agile

1212
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,760
you can be ethical

1213
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,799
do know har ethics there is an overlap

1214
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,000
um we need to be ethical regardless of

1215
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:36,760
