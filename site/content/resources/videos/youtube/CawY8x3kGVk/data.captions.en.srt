1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
one of the common uh myths in scrum is

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,200
that is really a a forum for

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,679
micromanagement and the there's a

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,560
there's a core test for this in your

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:21,240
team it is it is a myth right but it's a

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,840
reality for many teams so is it a myth

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,119
or is it not a myth that is a matter of

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,039
perspective however I would point out

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,920
that it's not scrum so it's a myth in

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,600
the context of scrum but it's not a myth

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,200
in the context of how lots of

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,640
organizations and teams approach scrum

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,440
because most organizations approach

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,000
something like scrum from their

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:51,120
traditional topown steering based

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,600
perspective and they want to tell teams

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,359
what they're going to deliver in a

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,519
Sprint so you walk into Sprint

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:03,280
planning and the product owner or the

20
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:06,960
tech lead or the project manager

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,360
or whoever the scrum Master the worst

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
one but the scrum Master says here's a

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,159
list of things we need you as a team to

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,400
do this

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,360
Sprint as soon as that

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,880
happens not

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,720
scrum we've gone out of the bounds of

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,960
the scrum guide who decides what we work

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,159
on this Sprint the developers who

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,960
decides how we work on it the Developers

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,640
okay it's not anybody else because the

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,040
developers that's this this core reason

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
why they dislike that approach it's the

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,600
developers that understand the nuance

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,520
and intricacies of the technical

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,920
challenges of actually delivering on the

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,479
work inside of the

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,360
Sprint nobody else can understand that

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,759
Nuance because they're living it right

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,320
they've got skills that I don't have as

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,119
a manager or as a product owner they've

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,799
got understanding of the product and the

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,680
technologies that we're using to deliver

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,240
that product the tools and techniques

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,039
that we're using their best place to

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,599
make that decision now can the product

47
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:17,360
owner say oh my goodness me we're in a

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,760
difficult place because we're not

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,280
working through the work that we need to

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,400
deliver as fast as we would like yeah

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,959
absolutely they can have that

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,440
conversation and they can have a

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
conversation with the developers about

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,599
how the developers might choose to cut

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,239
corn ERS into in order to accelerate

56
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:40,200
work but it must be done with their

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,959
Ascent if the developers say no then we

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,200
can't work any faster cuz we might be

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,720
taking on too much technical debt and

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,680
most businesses and for all businesses

61
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,480
all technical debt is a risk to the

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,720
business and most businesses don't

63
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,599
understand the context of technical debt

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,280
enough to make an informed decision on

65
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,879
whether they should acrew it

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,680
and how they should pay it back that's

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,799
why we have hired these technical

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,319
experts in order to deliver our product

69
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,200
and we should trust their understanding

70
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,319
and view of the product in order to do

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,239
that so I would say that it is a myth

72
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,200
that anybody should be telling the

73
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:27,280
developers what to work on and when to

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,000
work on it but I do understand that lots

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,840
of organizations don't understand and

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,439
how to let go of that control and are

77
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,439
