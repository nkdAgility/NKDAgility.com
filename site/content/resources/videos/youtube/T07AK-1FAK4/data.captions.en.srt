1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,279
one of the seven signs of the agile

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,559
apocalypse is the

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,040
Antichrist uh and in our context that

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,759
Antichrist is um fake agilists I think

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,039
that's probably the best way to describe

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,560
them people who perhaps have a

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,599
certification in agile they passed an

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,240
assessment perhaps they didn't even take

9
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,080
a class they just passed an assessment

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,280
and they believe that they're qualified

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:37,079
to help engage and enable software teams

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,760
when they have no clue whatsoever how

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,760
software is made those are the

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Antichrist
