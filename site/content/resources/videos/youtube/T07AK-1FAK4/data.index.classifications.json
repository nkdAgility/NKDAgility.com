    "reasoning": "The content critiques 'fake agilists', emphasizing the harm of superficial Agile adoption and stressing the need for genuine expertise, experience, and trust as core to real Agile leadership. It addresses the dangers of ritualism without foundational conviction, advocating for authentic value delivery and resilient team culture—aligning deeply with ethos. However, direct mention of 'ethos' as a concept is lacking, and discussion occasionally focuses on practical leadership and team dynamics, not always at system-level convictions. Still, it explores the contrast between authentic ethos and superficial compliance, with concrete examples, making it a strong but not maximal fit for the 'Ethos' category.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece robustly spotlights the tension between genuine and superficial Agile, advocating for authentic leadership rooted in experience and true values. While it doesn't use the term 'ethos' directly, its depth and focus on foundational convictions make it a strong, relevant fit for the Ethos category.",

    "reasoning": "Direct mentions of 'customer' and 'delivering value to our customers' are present but limited. The content's core theme is a warning against unqualified Agile leaders ('fake agilists') harming teams, with some emphasis on aligning Agile practices to outcomes that matter—'delivering value to our customers.' This fits the spirit of Customer Focus, but most discussion centers on leadership competence, team trust, and authentic agile, rather than deeply exploring how customer outcome measurement or feedback drives product delivery. The call to 'focus on outcomes' and reference to removing processes not aligned to customer value show partial alignment. However, explicit and in-depth discussion of defining/measuring customer outcomes, feedback loops, or value measurement is lacking. The audience (Agile practitioners, leaders) matches, focus is relevant, and content is well-structured with minimal off-topic material.",
    "reasoning_summary": "While the article warns against 'fake agilists' and speaks of prioritising customer value, its main emphasis lies on leadership credibility and agile authenticity rather than systematically measuring or driving development by customer outcomes. Thus, it’s partially but not deeply aligned with Customer Focus.",

    "reasoning": "While the content discusses deviations from 'genuine' Agile and the harm of unqualified practitioners, it does not explicitly mention or carefully define first principles as immutable constraints. The piece highlights values like trust and real experience, but these are more framed as best practices or indicative of authenticity than foundational first principles. There are no direct references to first principles in Lean, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps, nor does the discussion distinguish between first, derived, or heuristic principles. The main thrust focuses on avoiding bad leadership rather than grounding practices in irreducible truths, so while the alignment is partial (since integrity to fundamental concepts is implied), the content does not directly meet the strict inclusion criteria.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This article warns against unqualified Agile leaders but does not discuss first principles explicitly or in depth.
