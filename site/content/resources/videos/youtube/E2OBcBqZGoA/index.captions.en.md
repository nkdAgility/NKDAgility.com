If even large organizations are struggling to maximize the value from the work they're undertaking, what chance do small organizations have? They have a greater chance because they're more able to adapt the way they do business in order to get the benefits we're looking for. We want to decentralize decision making. We want to push responsibility down the organization, and we want to maximize the ability for the people in our organization to leverage the skills that they have in order to maximize our value. They need to be connected to our story. They need to be behind it, and you need to involve them in creating it.
