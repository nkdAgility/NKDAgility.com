In my experience working with organisations of all sizes, one thing has become abundantly clear: the struggle to maximise value from our work is not exclusive to large enterprises. In fact, I would argue that smaller organisations often have a distinct advantage in this area. Why? Because they possess the agility to adapt their business practices more readily than their larger counterparts.

### The Power of Decentralisation

Decentralising decision-making is crucial for any organisation aiming to thrive in today’s fast-paced environment. When we push responsibility down the hierarchy, we empower our teams to make decisions that are informed by their unique insights and expertise. This not only fosters a sense of ownership but also accelerates the decision-making process. Here’s how decentralisation can benefit your organisation:

- **Faster Responses**: Teams can react quickly to changes in the market or customer needs without waiting for approval from the top.
- **Enhanced Innovation**: When individuals feel responsible for their work, they are more likely to think creatively and propose innovative solutions.
- **Stronger Engagement**: Employees who are involved in decision-making are more connected to the organisation’s goals and vision.

### Leveraging Skills for Maximum Value

To truly maximise value, we must ensure that our teams are not just skilled but also engaged in the organisation's narrative. It’s essential that every member of the team understands the story we are telling and feels a part of it. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

- **Involve Teams in Story Creation**: Encourage your teams to contribute to the narrative of the organisation. This could be through brainstorming sessions, workshops, or regular feedback loops.
- **Connect Skills to Goals**: Help your team members see how their individual skills contribute to the larger objectives of the organisation. This connection can be incredibly motivating.
- **Foster a Culture of Collaboration**: Create an environment where collaboration is encouraged. When people work together, they can leverage each other’s strengths and create more value collectively.

### The Real-World Relevance

I’ve seen firsthand how organisations that embrace these principles can transform their operations. For instance, a small tech startup I worked with decentralised their decision-making process, allowing developers to take ownership of their projects. The result? Not only did they deliver features faster, but the quality of their work improved significantly as team members felt more invested in the outcomes.

Conversely, I’ve also witnessed larger organisations struggle under the weight of bureaucracy. Their decision-making processes are often slow and cumbersome, leading to missed opportunities and frustrated employees. This stark contrast highlights the importance of agility and adaptability in today’s business landscape.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while large organisations may have more resources, smaller organisations have the agility to adapt and thrive. By decentralising decision-making and involving team members in the creation of the organisation’s story, we can maximise the value of our work. It’s about creating a culture where everyone feels connected and responsible for the outcomes. 

Let’s embrace these principles and empower our teams to drive value in ways that resonate with their skills and passions. After all, when people are engaged and connected to the story, the potential for success is limitless.
