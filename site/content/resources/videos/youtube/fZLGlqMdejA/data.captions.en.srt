1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,040
so one of the civil and deadly sins of

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,879
agile is greed and this usually

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:19,199
manifests in um in

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,760
organizations by a an overwhelming focus

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,560
on resource

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,880
utilization let's let's get rid of the

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,640
fact that we're calling everybody

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,800
resources as if they're cogs in a

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,480
machine rather than actual people right

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:37,079
but but that focus on resource

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,719
utilization was a fantastic idea when we

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,399
were running

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,399
machines and machines could churn out

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,559
things on a regular Cadence and we were

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,199
able to the more your machine is running

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,280
the more value you're getting in return

17
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,359
for the the cost of the machine and the

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,960
cost to run it right um that's how you

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,840
would what where that re resource

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,040
utilization idea comes from but when you

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:11,000
start looking at people and how people

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,520
do work people need a a thinking time

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,520
people need uh um do things different

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,520
ways right if if we can automate stuff

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,960
that we do the same all the time but if

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,920
we're going to do something different

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,880
all the time which in my world

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,560
background is a software engineer

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,439
everything we coded was something new

30
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,360
otherwise we would have used an existing

31
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
framework

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,520
right um so anytime you're writing code

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,119
you're doing something new anytime

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,280
you're building a product that doesn't

35
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,799
exist yet you're doing something new

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,280
that's never been done before right so

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,720
when you're doing those even if it's

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,119
been done before by somebody else it's

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,920
not been done before by you um and when

40
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:54,520
you're doing that uh you need to um give

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,320
people the space to be able to do things

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,960
well to be able to think about things to

43
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,280
be able to learn things to be able to

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,759
try things and that means that people

45
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,240
aren't always 100% focused on the work

46
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,759
that they're doing they they're they're

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,599
doing other things while thinking about

48
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,959
that work uh some examples maybe um have

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,120
you ever uh been working on something

50
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,720
and got

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,640
stuck and the only way for you to get un

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,599
no matter how much time you spent on

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,400
this thing you were stuck right you're

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,800
100% utilized because you're working on

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,160
this thing

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,920
but you're not making any progress

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,760
you're not delivering any value but if

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,760
you just go uh go out for a walk right

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,400
or you sit with your wife and you

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,159
explain the problem to your I do this

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,760
all the time I explain some problem to

62
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,200
my wife and she doesn't necessarily

63
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,080
understand the problem that I've got

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,200
right I'm talking about code and

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,959
architectures and things and halfway

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,560
through explaining it I figured out what

67
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,400
my problem was right cuz I knew I just

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,640
didn't have a

69
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440
moment to look to the side I don't know

70
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,760
if that makes sense like like an out of

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,720
body out of idea experience out of body

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,640
experience and look at that thing from

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,239
the

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,440
outside um so that that resource

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,519
utilization is a fallacy uh when you're

76
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,879
talking about people um there's no such

77
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,319
thing as resource utilization you want

78
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:28,640
to be looking at flow efficiency and

79
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,360
value delivery how much value Are you

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,360
delivering to your customer and I

81
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,840
actually I don't care if my team members

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,120
are sitting around on their butts for

83
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,799
90% of the time as long as we're

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,879
delivering the value to the customer

85
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,959
right the value to the customer is the

86
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,360
important thing is the customer happy

87
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,720
are we getting an adequate return on

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,799
investment for our product those are the

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,720
ideas uh that make sense um I worked

90
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,360
with somebody years ago who ran a little

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,280
experiment with some teams um that he

92
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:02,400
worked with in a in a company in the US

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,360
and he uh decided to to or got convinced

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,400
leadership that per Sprint he would

95
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,200
remove an

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,599
hour from each

97
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,840
Sprint so you can imagine you've got a

98
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,519
40h hour

99
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,880
week per week per Sprint you've got a

100
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,440
40h hour week the next Sprint he's going

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,960
to do a 39h hour week with the team and

102
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,039
the Sprint after that he's going to do a

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,160
38h hour week with the team and the

104
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,520
Sprint after that is going to do a

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,360
37-hour week with the team and I've got

106
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,160
a question for you at what point do you

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,919
believe that value delivery

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,360
suffered if the focus is on value

109
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,280
delivery delivering features now that

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
doesn't mean that for the other two

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,120
hours people aren't the the the the

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,960
hours that you remove people aren't

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,160
actually working right if you think

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,919
about it scrum team somebody who's

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,320
focused on solving problems um works

116
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,759
100% of the time right when I'm when I'm

117
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,080
having a shower in the morning or when

118
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm I actually do a lot of my best ideas

119
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,120
at the gym I go to the gym I'm working

120
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,240
out the gym and I go oh that's a great

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,800
idea and I go on my phone and I message

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
it to myself right and then the next

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,000
idea Pops in how to solve problems and

124
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,240
figure these out is not something that

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,560
you get from 100% utilization it's you

126
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,880
need thinking time uh so can you guess

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,919
where he got to he got to 16 hours per

128
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,560
week before um uh uh value delivery

129
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
started to suffer because all the rest

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,479
of the time is thinking time that the

131
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,400
team needed thinking and then noodling

132
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,919
time um

133
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:52,479
so very much Stop Being

134
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,919
Greedy stop trying to get people to

135
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,240
maximize their

136
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,000
utilization and instead focus on

137
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,240
maximizing the flow of Val all you

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,199
