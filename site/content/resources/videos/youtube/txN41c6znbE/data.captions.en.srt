1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,600
agile went wrong fairly early on it

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000
started to go off the rails almost right

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,800
from the beginning because there were

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,719
there were certain assumptions that were

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,480
made by the folks that codified it that

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:20,519
created the agel manifesto so think

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,400
think of those folks as um they were the

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,720
right people that were available at the

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,279
right time right so there's probably

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,519
people that were around at the time that

11
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,759
could have been in that room but weren't

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,120
right uh just because weren't available

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,760
or whatever but the people that were

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,760
invited to to to

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,520
Snowbird um

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,840
were the best of the best working with

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,920
the best of the best so because um they

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,440
they were already very highly regarded

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,480
in their Industries um they were already

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,840
working with people who were very highly

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,879
regarded and there was an assumption of

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,080
uh competence I Assumption of capability

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,880
um of the people that were participating

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,159
within the process that we're talking

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:14,040
about so for agile to be

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,479
successful um we have to be

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,240
continuously trying to figure out

28
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,240
whether we're doing the right thing we

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,520
have to be

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,000
continuously validating we have to be

31
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,479
continuously learning and figuring out

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,799
new ways to do things and continuously

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,079
closing closing those learning loops so

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,000
that we change the our mental model of

35
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,520
of of of how things

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,119
work

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:49,040
and I don't think our current systems of

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,360
education and the world itself is is set

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,520
up to create the majority of people that

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,079
are like that I feel like uh the

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,479
majority of of people aren't really

42
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,520
interested in all of that stuff and

43
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,320
perhaps just want to go to work get a

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,920
paycheck and go home I think a lot of

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,599
people can be convinced to work

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,800
differently but I I if we're talking

47
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,640
about what's the current status um I

48
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,400
would probably Hazard a guess and it is

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,319
a guess um that that only about 20% of

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,879
people are really interested in that

51
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,080
level of uh of commitment of figuring

52
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,560
things out of of of trying to do things

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,440
which means

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,400
that the demand for folks that

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,280
understand agile now that's quite a wide

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,280
bucket right folks that understand agile

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,840
within organizations whether that's for

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,800
um leadership positions like scrum

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Master on up through the organization or

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,560
for product focused at folks product

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,400
management through the organization or

62
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,480
for um

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,840
doers right the the the the I work with

64
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,120
software teams so generally it's the

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,760
engineering team members that I'm

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
talking about there but the doers up

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,720
through the organization um what

68
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:19,959
percentage of of of your leaders

69
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,560
um product people and doers actually

70
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:28,439
take the time to go read blog posts read

71
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,959
books um experiment uh discuss and

72
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,239
collaborate like I I participate in a

73
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
number of of of

74
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:40,560
communities

75
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,920
um like meetups where people gather to

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,400
discuss some of these topics and learn

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,599
more and there's not that many people

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,000
there compared to the number of people

79
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,280
that are doing that type of work right

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,040
um when you sell a book on a particular

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,680
topic and the the well-known people you

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,200
know they sell more copies uh H the new

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,159
new spring gold book has been doing

84
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:11,640
awesome but still the number of people

85
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,680
that buy it is a tiny percentage of uh

86
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,720
the

87
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,400
people that probably need to read it

88
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,440
right so I think

89
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,280
that when we we need to caveat when

90
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,720
we're talking about

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,280
agile agile

92
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,120
teams are like Special Operations

93
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,840
teams right they have distinct

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,280
particular focus on maximizing the value

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,120
from the work done right and

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,960
continuously iterating on that and

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
learning new things and practicing they

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,759
probably spend quite a high percentage

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
of their time learning and practicing

100
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,919
and trying new things and that's not

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,280
most teams that's not most organizations

102
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,919
that's not most people I I read a blog

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,160
post years ago um and I it struck me

104
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,520
this was when I was brand new um it

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,280
struck me very much that that the first

106
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,600
line was if you're reading this you're

107
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,400
already in the top 10% it was about

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
software engineers and learning and that

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,600
kind of thing if you're reading it

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,000
you're already in the top 10 per. what

111
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
percentage of your people actually read

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,199
and learn and trying trying better

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,800
themselves that

114
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,560
that is the

115
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,319
assumption that you're going to have a

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,960
team of people like that that comes from

117
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,199
from from from agile there kind of a

118
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,400
fundamental requirement of being agile

119
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,560
is having folks like that and that's

120
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,280
kind of why um I guess the scrum Master

121
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,360
exists to proxy some of that because

122
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
you're going to have lots of people on

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,600
your team who are not like that so the

124
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,639
person who's like that on your

125
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:56,240
engineering team the doer who's most

126
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,560
focused on the effectiveness of the team

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
is probably the perfect choice to be the

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,919
scrum master and and then move up

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,600
through the organization through

130
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,759
leadership roles right a great example

131
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,039
of that is satian Adela right um was a

132
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,960
software engineer now runs the whole

133
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,880
runs the whole show um so the thing that

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,599
went wrong is agile accelerated much

135
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,520
more quickly than there was supply of

136
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,160
these folks there was an assumption that

137
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,360
these folks had those skills and

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,560
capability and they're just not there

139
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,520
and they don't exist today um there's

140
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,720
not been systemic

141
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,960
investment in

142
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,440
bettering people within organizations of

143
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,039
hypothesis driven practices right of of

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,080
encouraging people to experiment and try

145
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:53,199
things and H place bets right if if you

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,759
can get that that that that efficiency

147
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
um we can spread that across the

148
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,000
organization because it works within our

149
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,240
context if we don't then we advertise

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,280
the the the cost of running that

151
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,759
experiment across the whole business and

152
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,599
that that philosophy is just not

153
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,440
fundamentally there so when we do find

154
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,120
people that are really good at it that's

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
the folks that t that that we want to

156
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,120
have promoted through scrum Master

157
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,080
through leadership in our in our

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:27,240
organization um but they're so few and

159
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,720
far between that even within that

160
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,800
context most people in positions as

161
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,759
scrum Masters um there's some data from

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,440
an organization called scrum match um

163
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,560
who if

164
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,400
effectively I'm I'm I'm going to

165
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,280
paraphrase this it's not quite the way

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,240
it works but they're effectively

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:50,080
validating um scrum

168
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,199
Masters so that if you're going to go

169
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,919
hire this person as a scrum Master you

170
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,560
know where what you're what you're

171
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,720
getting um so it's validated through a

172
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,319
valid an in iners is not the right word

173
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
but a face Toof face uh validation

174
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,599
process with two professional scrum

175
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,240
trainers um who understand not just the

176
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,599
scrum Masters uh competence within scrum

177
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,840
right but their competence within their

178
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,199
enabling teams to be effective enabling

179
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,680
product owners to be effective and

180
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,000
enabling the organization to be

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,479
effective so all the way up the tree and

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,280
they they give effectively a a level a

183
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,560
capability level based on based on based

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,200
on their their engagement with that

185
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,599
person I think it's like a two or three

186
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I think it's a two or three hour process

187
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,320
right validation process of of of of

188
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,000
talking and discussing and describing

189
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,480
scenarios and and talking about the

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,839
skills and what they

191
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,880
found not everybody that's coming to

192
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,839
them is looking for a job for example I

193
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,320
went through their their their process

194
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,200
um and I'm not looking for a job right

195
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,760
um but that's their intent is you have

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,800
this moniker for your for your for your

197
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,160
CV to validate for

198
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,640
employers that you do have a certain

199
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,160
level of skill so there certainly going

200
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,560
to be a bias to people who are who are

201
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,760
looking for work um and what they found

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,920
was that

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:21,160
39% of the people that were

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,959
coming and saying I'm a scrum master um

205
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,320
hadn't hadn't even read the scrum guide

206
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:30,120
hadn't even taken the most basic

207
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
learning step

208
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,640
of reading the

209
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,240
manual manual for the thing the job that

210
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,160
they're taking and there you know the

211
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,320
scrum guide exists it's there it's been

212
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,000
around for h four 14 years it's been

213
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,480
around for 14 years

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,920
and these were not just new scrum

215
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Masters these were people who had been

216
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,040
in rooll for up to 10 years so this is

217
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,160
somebody who's been a scrum Master for

218
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,279
10 years in organiz ation and hasn't

219
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,519
read the scrum

220
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,680
gu for me that's AB

221
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:12,760
incompetence that is not capable of of

222
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,760
fulfilling the role of of of of scrum

223
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,880
master in an organization I mean it may

224
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,720
depend how the role of scrum Masters

225
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,519
defined right I'm kind of separating

226
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,320
here the idea

227
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,800
of what the accountability for the scrum

228
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,720
Master within the context of scrum and

229
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,120
the job title of scrum Master which is

230
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,440
company specific specific and will have

231
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,640
other accountabilities um but a

232
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,760
fundamental level if you're going to be

233
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,040
a scrum Master you should have read a

234
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,760
scrum guide and even I think there was a

235
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,200
further

236
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,440
12% um that that had read the scrum

237
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,040
guide but had a really

238
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,240
rudimentary understanding of of scrum

239
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,360
and then another few percent that that

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,600
probably weren't capable of applying it

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,519
within the context so what it ended up

242
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,000
with was

243
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,360
61% of of people people who identify as

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,440
scrum Masters perhaps currently hold

245
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,839
jobs as scrum Masters um are not capable

246
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,839
of being scrum Masters yet they've been

247
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:17,000
holding positions and have experience as

248
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,480
scrum Masters um and that is systemic of

249
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,839
what what we're talking about here

250
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,399
that's systemic of the problem that the

251
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:29,959
the the the two things the the demand

252
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,959
has outstripped Supply therefore

253
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,160
organizational hiring practices have

254
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,160
systematically reduced the bar to meet

255
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,800
the Demand right the quality of the

256
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,639
participants that they demand has

257
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,760
dropped um so that they can fill the

258
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,880
positions um and that means that there's

259
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,320
a lot of people who have absolutely no

260
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,760
business being scrum Masters in in role

261
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,040
and you may go look to hire somebody and

262
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,399
they're like I've been a scrum Master

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,600
for 10 years at XYZ and they are still

264
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:06,160
incapable of of fulfilling that role um

265
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,240
I just saw a a comment recently um it

266
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,320
was highlighted by one of one of my my

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,959
colleagues on LinkedIn of a scrum master

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,399
who had been in role for two years

269
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,600
they've been a scrum Master for two

270
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,680
years didn't know what a release plan

271
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,079
was no idea what a release plan is no

272
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,000
idea how to create one or what one looks

273
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:30,320
like how can you possibly cach a team

274
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,920
within the context of that organization

275
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,720
and not understand the things that that

276
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,120
organization needs to function rightly

277
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,480
or wrongly you might not like release

278
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,279
plans right or you might have a

279
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,680
different idea of release plan from I

280
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,440
have from release plan but if you've

281
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,720
worked for two years in a company in a

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,839
role for maximizing the effectiveness of

283
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,120
teams and you don't know what the assets

284
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,800
are that the teams need to create in

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,639
order for the organization to consider

286
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,240
them

287
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,480
effective you

288
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,160
right and why I mean that's a specific

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
that's a very specific occurrence not

290
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,880
trying to throw them under the bus um

291
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,920
but why why do people not have this

292
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,040
information why do they not understand

293
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,000
it why why are are are businesses hiring

294
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,360
people that have no ability absolutely

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,519
no ability to do the job and and for me

296
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
there's a couple of things that this

297
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,639
comes down to it comes down to the

298
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,600
supply demand issue I.E there are very

299
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:35,560
few people who take the time and effort

300
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:39,279
who care enough about their

301
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,680
capability to go do that stuff to go

302
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,199
read blog posts watch videos uh try

303
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,240
stuff learn there's very few people in

304
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,880
that in that in that category I know

305
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,720
lots of people in that category right I

306
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,959
know lots of people who do that but I

307
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,560
think I probably wouldn't know the

308
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,720
people that aren't because that's the

309
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,399
circles that I'm in

310
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,240
right so all of my colleagues are kind

311
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,320
of like that I do come across uh people

312
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,639
who have absolutely no interest in in

313
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,480
learning anything new um none at all so

314
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:17,000
that that that's a big piece but I also

315
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:21,000
think a big piece is organization's

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,160
willingness to cut quality to fill roles

317
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,240
it's just not I mean I I can I can I can

318
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,600
kind of understand that in certain cont

319
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,959
text right if it's if it's software

320
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,680
Engineers people on teams doers right

321
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,800
you can you can train doers um I I would

322
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,639
say it's much it's much easier to teach

323
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,720
somebody a programming

324
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,800
language or teach somebody a a a test

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,959
tool or some capability that they don't

326
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:56,240
have than it is to teach them a

327
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,920
philosophy so that fundamental

328
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,639
philosophy of continuous lifelong

329
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,720
learning is something you need to hire

330
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,880
for not teach for because you're

331
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,759
probably going to be very difficult to

332
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,440
teach

333
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:10,839
that I think please correct me in the

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,440
comments right but I think that's going

335
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,720
to be very hard to to to teach for

336
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,360
so for such a

337
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,079
fundamental pivotal role as the coach

338
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,360
for the

339
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:30,519
team how are they possibly going to be

340
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:35,560
able to be capable

341
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:40,040
without deep knowledge and understanding

342
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,680
of the context of that team the context

343
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,720
of the product and the context of the

344
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,240
organization right those are the three

345
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,720
contexts that that person needs now you

346
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,240
you gain contexts in the organization

347
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,800
General organization you're your

348
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,680
organization by being in it for for time

349
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,040
right um you gain context of the product

350
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,800
by either working in that industry or

351
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,600
that context for a long time and then

352
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,519
that specific product for a while and

353
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,759
you gain context of the type of work

354
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,600
that the team are doing by doing that

355
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,959
type of work for a time so the most

356
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:26,440
logical

357
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:29,160
people to go through that promotion into

358
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,680
scrum Master right for the team which is

359
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,399
which is should be a self- selection not

360
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
self- selection I I select it but the

361
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,880
team selects the person they're the

362
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,040
candidates for moving through leadership

363
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,959
in the

364
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,720
organization they have they have empathy

365
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,800
they have skills in the context of the

366
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,639
work that we're doing they have skills

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,440
in the context of the organization and

368
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,680
they have time in the organization

369
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
experience in in understanding those

370
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,199
things that's who you want as scrum

371
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,959
Masters you don't really want to be

372
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:03,560
hiring them in in because they're not

373
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,720
going to have any of those contacts or

374
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,559
potentially not have any of those

375
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,640
contacts this is this is why um

376
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,760
H the the the financial industry who

377
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,000
have very

378
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,360
specific kind of

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,079
idiosyncrasies tend to require if we're

380
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,480
going to hire people they need to have

381
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,160
worked in finance before we're not going

382
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,120
to hire somebody who's not worked in

383
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,799
finance because it's too much trouble to

384
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,840
teach them and it's too

385
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,480
disruptive because

386
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,559
finances like this so I need we need

387
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,160
people who are already able to work

388
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:44,400
within that environment that that that

389
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,760
struggle

390
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,600
um so why does that just apply to

391
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,440
finance why doesn't that apply to to to

392
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,960
to other

393
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,600
places this fundamental lack of not just

394
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,760
lack of initial competence

395
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,799
right but our skills atrophy I I I I

396
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,080
once and this was in finance I one work

397
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,400
worked in finance many mons ago I

398
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,640
probably wouldn't do it again as an

399
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,240
employee for sure um but I worked in

400
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,559
finance and the person sitting next to

401
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,159
me um I just started a new job the

402
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,080
person that ins to me was a user

403
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,840
experience specialist um and they were

404
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,240
complaining that they hadn't done

405
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,280
anything new they've been working there

406
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,559
for four years and they hadn't done

407
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,360
anything new in four years and they felt

408
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,440
like they were unemployable

409
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,919
think how sad and dejected and unhappy

410
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,200
that person

411
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,880
is and how much effort do you think they

412
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,600
spend on enabling the success of the

413
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,240
organization none right they're not

414
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,880
spending any time on that they're biing

415
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,559
their time that organization actually

416
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,919
didn't last super long um after that

417
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:59,440
but that's that fundamental competence

418
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:03,159
that you should be looking for and

419
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,840
we we we need to have that Focus

420
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,200
otherwise we're going to continue to end

421
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,480
up in exactly the same position which is

422
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,520
bringing what what this is what

423
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,080
organizations have been doing for many

424
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,440
years is we're going to take the most

425
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,960
Junior unskilled person and make them

426
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,600
the scrum Master who's accountable for

427
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,480
the effectiveness of the team how the

428
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,120
most Junior unskilled person is going to

429
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,039
be able to do that I do not know um

430
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,919
because it's not deemed as a valuable

431
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,880
thing therefore there's no

432
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
leaders to promote through the

433
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,760
organization who have a fundamental um

434
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,799
background and understanding of what it

435
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,640
is that we're doing how we're building

436
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:43,000
products and that experimentation and

437
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,919
and and ideas up through the

438
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,280
organization so I think we've kind of

439
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,000
done it to ourselves this is this is

440
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
there are po there are pockets of

441
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,520
agility there are folks out there who

442
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,360
are really good at this stuff uh but

443
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,000
they're generally not listened to um

444
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,280
they're generally skilled enough that

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,919
they go become a consultant right

446
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,480
because of the supply demand issue if

447
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
the supply demand issue was different

448
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,720
they would maybe still the employees

449
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,919
because they would be being successful

450
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,960
and having fun within an organization

451
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,240
but they're not they they're they're

452
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,919
getting frustrated that organizations

453
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,640
can't change and organizations can't

454
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,559
change because they're fundamentally not

455
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,720
addressing these core competency issues

456
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,000
they don't have enough momentum they

457
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,440
don't have enough people who have those

458
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,159
core competencies to move forward

459
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,000
um and these folks get frustrated and go

460
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
s this I'm going to go start my own

461
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,440
business being a consultant and at least

462
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,960
I get paid more for doing terrible work

463
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,360
with with these

464
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,679
organizations um but there I mean

465
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,679
there's there's light at the end of the

466
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:48,320
tunnel if you're an

467
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,320
organization

468
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,679
who is already on their

469
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:58,280
journey to improve the agility of their

470
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,960
organization or you want to be higher

471
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:05,280
for competence hire for lifelong

472
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,960
learning hire for somebody who has the

473
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,400
interest enough to do more than a PSM or

474
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,720
CSM level one

475
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,760
certification to be that

476
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:20,120
thing I I I really fundamentally don't

477
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,840
understand why HR and hiring managers

478
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,520
are expecting somebody who's done a

479
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,360
two-day

480
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,320
course to understand how to I mean I

481
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,000
kind of do I years ago I worked in an

482
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,120
organization and the accountant was sent

483
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,600
on a MS project course and when he came

484
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,039
back he was the new project manager and

485
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,320
it was the disaster that you're

486
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,760
expecting in your head it was the a

487
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,760
absolute

488
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,440
unmitigated accounting focused disaster

489
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,480
of of of

490
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,480
uh yeah so

491
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,520
so I understand that it's happening but

492
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,760
if we want to be different if we want to

493
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,159
get the value from agility that we need

494
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,320
we have to change the way we approach

495
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,480
that we have to hire for competence

496
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,960
within the context of the roles and that

497
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,919
probably means now I don't know the the

498
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,159
Cs um I'm not a scrum Alliance trainer

499
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm a scrum the do trainer so my

500
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,159
understanding my knowledge is is more in

501
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,760
that space um I if I'm looking to hire

502
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:32,240
scrum Masters I am not looking for PSM

503
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,600
one not even remotely looking for psm1

504
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,279
I'm looking for if I'm looking for a

505
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,480
scrum Master for one team in a large

506
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:43,640
organization I'm at least looking for

507
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:46,520
psm2 but realistically I want a PSM 3

508
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,000
psm3 has demonstrated knowledge and

509
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,440
capability it's essay based questions

510
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,360
we're no longer in the multiple choice

511
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,640
world so it's much harder for somebody

512
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,760
without the competence who isn't

513
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,080
interested in lifelong learning it it's

514
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,240
much harder much much harder for them to

515
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,480
gain that

516
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,840
certification right uh the psm3 so

517
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,000
that's that's probably would be my

518
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,120
minimum bar I would it be my minimum bar

519
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,559
I think it has to be my minimum bar my

520
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,120
minimum bar would be psm3 if I'm hiring

521
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,159
a scrum master and I'm bringing them

522
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:26,000
into my business minimum psm3 and I then

523
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,600
want to look at what's the context of my

524
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,039
my product does that scrum Master have a

525
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,720
experience within that context so if my

526
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,120
context is software engineering which

527
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,880
mine generally is I want to hire

528
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,960
somebody who understands software

529
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,400
engineering somebody who has experience

530
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,240
and understands the philosophies of

531
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,200
devops who understands the the the the

532
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,520
practices and techniques that make sense

533
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,400
to help teams be effective because a

534
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,120
good coach coaches and teaches the team

535
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,520
in practices they don't understand or

536
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,240
aren't very good at right and in order

537
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,720
to do that you have to understand them

538
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,720
if you want to teach those things so at

539
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,279
at the very least PSM 3 then look at um

540
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,000
engineering

541
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:14,960
competence then look at product

542
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,880
competence because they need to help

543
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,720
coach the product owner product

544
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,679
management in building a better product

545
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,320
and then business well that's kind of

546
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,360
business product/ business and then I

547
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,559
guess it's called organizational Evol

548
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,200
uary context right what skills and

549
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,960
capabilities do they have in

550
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,960
organizational change in building

551
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,559
relationships across the organization in

552
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:44,799
doing those things these the folks that

553
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,440
can do it all are fairly rare right

554
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,640
folks that can do it all are absolutely

555
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,799
fairly rare I I I agree there but if

556
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,880
I've got somebody just for a team I

557
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,480
probably need mostly if it's a new team

558
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,279
mostly engineering support with a little

559
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,320
bit of business and a little bit of org

560
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,799
if I'm hiring for somebody who's looking

561
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,320
across multiple teams I probably have

562
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,640
the engineering is maybe not as

563
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,720
important but the business context is

564
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,200
much more important and if I'm hiring

565
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,640
somebody who's looking across the whole

566
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,360
organization then the organizational

567
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,919
transformational Mastery is is is the

568
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,720
most important but I still want business

569
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,360
context and I still want I'm calling it

570
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:32,200
engineering context right but he cont

571
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:35,919
context the work context uh uh on that

572
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,799
end as well so this is fundamentally why

573
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,159
somebody like Sati and Adella is is so

574
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,320
hugely successful within the context and

575
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:49,120
has absolutely turned a multi-million

576
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,679
dollar business around because while he

577
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
has engineering capability he

578
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,039
understands engineering he understands

579
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,320
the proc practices he understands how

580
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,039
important it is to spend time on

581
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,799
learning and those practices and those

582
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:04,559
things he also understands business

583
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,000
which is how we made it up through

584
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,240
management the organization and he

585
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,600
understands organizational

586
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,760
transformational context right how do

587
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,360
you change an organization how do you

588
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,000
adapt it towards a new outcome that

589
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,880
opens up new markets and new

590
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,320
capabilities and that's why he's the

591
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,159
CEO right and he's been hugely

592
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,880
successful at it he's got a book hit

593
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,039
refresh definitely worth uh a

594
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,600
read this is what we're talking about

595
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,720
this level of competence is what's not

596
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,480
there and this level of competence is

597
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,480
what we need to fix
