    "description": "ðŸ”§ Where Agile Went Wrong: Addressing the Competence Crisis ðŸš¨\n\nIn this video, I discuss how Agile started going off the rails right from the beginning due to certain assumptions made by the creators of the Agile Manifesto. While they were the right people at the right time, there was an assumption that everyone participating had a high level of competence and continuous learning capabilities. Unfortunately, our current systems of education and work donâ€™t foster that level of commitment to learning and experimentation. I explain how demand for skilled Agile practitioners has far outpaced the supply, leading organizations to lower the bar and hire Scrum Masters and leaders who lack the necessary skills to truly support their teams. \n\nI dive into why we need to refocus on hiring people who prioritize lifelong learning and why the roles of Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and leaders require deep context and competence to drive Agile success. If we donâ€™t address this, weâ€™ll continue to see a disconnect between Agile theory and real-world results. This video is all about how we can course-correct and build a more capable Agile workforce. ðŸ’¡\n\nb) Chapters\n\n0:00 - Introduction: Agileâ€™s Early Mistakes \n0:28 - The Assumptions Made by Agileâ€™s Founders  \n1:06 - The Importance of Continuous Learning and Validation  \n1:52 - Why Most People Arenâ€™t Committed to Lifelong Learning \n2:31 - The Supply-Demand Imbalance for Agile Competence  \n3:29 - The Role of Agile Communities and Learning  \n4:45 - Agile Teams as Special Operations Teams  \n5:09 - The Competence Crisis in Agile Roles\n6:03 - Scrum Masters: The Proxy for Team Competence  \n7:30 - The Incompetence of Many Scrum Masters  \n9:05 - Why Hiring Practices Must Change to Fix Agile  \n10:35 - Promoting Competent Leaders from Within the Organization  \n12:02 - The Importance of Context in Agile Leadership  \n13:22 - Why HR Should Demand Higher Standards for Scrum Masters  \n14:54 - Satya Nadella: A Case Study in Agile Leadership Competence\n\nIs your organization struggling with a shortage of truly competent Agile leaders?
