  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Agile was supposed to revolutionize the way we build and deliver products, but it veered off track surprisingly early. The seeds of these challenges were planted during the creation of the Agile Manifesto itself. At Snowbird, a group of experienced and capable practitioners crafted a vision for agility in software development. However, they made some assumptions that have come to haunt us.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Let’s dive into where these assumptions came from, how they shaped Agile’s early days, and why today’s landscape demands a more rigorous focus on competence and continuous learning. 🌱</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-assumptions-made-by-agile-s-founders\"><strong>The Assumptions Made by Agile’s Founders</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Agile pioneers at Snowbird were highly esteemed professionals—working with the best in their industries. But their selection came with an implicit assumption: that everyone involved in Agile’s growth would be just as competent, curious, and capable.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Assumption of Competence</strong>: The expectation was that everyone participating in Agile practices would have a high level of competence.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Assumption of Capability</strong>: They believed that people would have the drive and skill to engage deeply with Agile principles.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The reality, however, turned out to be quite different. Many teams and organizations have struggled to live up to these expectations, leading to a competence gap that continues to impact the effectiveness of Agile.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-continuous-learning-matters-in-agile\"><strong>Why Continuous Learning Matters in Agile</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For Agile to truly succeed, we need to constantly reassess whether we are on the right path. This requires:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Continuous Learning</strong> 📚: We must be committed to learning, experimenting, and adapting.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Continuous Validation</strong> ✅: Regularly testing assumptions to ensure we’re moving in the right direction.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Closing Learning Loops</strong> 🔄: Adjusting our mental models based on new insights and experiences.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Yet, the world isn't set up to foster this kind of mindset widely. As someone who has seen Agile in action, I can tell you that only about 20% of people are truly committed to this level of continuous improvement. The rest? They often prefer a simpler routine—go to work, get a paycheck, go home.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-supply-demand-imbalance-for-agile-competence\"><strong>The Supply-Demand Imbalance for Agile Competence</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The demand for Agile professionals has outstripped the supply of truly competent individuals.

Organizations have lowered their hiring standards to fill these roles, leading to a large number of people who don’t have the necessary skills to be effective Scrum Masters.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:separator -->\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\r\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-hiring-practices-must-change-to-fix-agile\"><strong>Why Hiring Practices Must Change to Fix Agile </strong><strong>🛠️</strong><strong></strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Organizations must rethink their hiring practices for Agile roles:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":1} -->\r\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Hire for Lifelong Learning</strong> 📚: Seek out individuals who actively pursue knowledge—those who read, watch videos, and experiment with new practices.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Raise the Bar for Certifications</strong> 🎓: A two-day course like PSM or CSM Level 1 isn’t enough.
