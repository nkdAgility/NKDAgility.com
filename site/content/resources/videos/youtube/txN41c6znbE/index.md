# The difference between a rock solid, deeply competent scrum master and a Jira Jockey

ðŸ”§ Where Agile Went Wrong: Addressing the Competence Crisis ðŸš¨

In this video, I discuss how Agile started going off the rails right from the beginning due to certain assumptions made by the creators of the Agile Manifesto. While they were the right people at the right time, there was an assumption that everyone participating had a high level of competence and continuous learning capabilities. Unfortunately, our current systems of education and work donâ€™t foster that level of commitment to learning and experimentation. I explain how demand for skilled Agile practitioners has far outpaced the supply, leading organizations to lower the bar and hire Scrum Masters and leaders who lack the necessary skills to truly support their teams. 

I dive into why we need to refocus on hiring people who prioritize lifelong learning and why the roles of Scrum Masters, Product Owners, and leaders require deep context and competence to drive Agile success. If we donâ€™t address this, weâ€™ll continue to see a disconnect between Agile theory and real-world results. This video is all about how we can course-correct and build a more capable Agile workforce. ðŸ’¡
