Agile was supposed to revolutionize the way we build and deliver products, but it veered off track surprisingly early. The seeds of these challenges were planted during the creation of the Agile Manifesto itself. At Snowbird, a group of experienced and capable practitioners crafted a vision for agility in software development. However, they made some assumptions that have come to haunt us.

Let’s dive into where these assumptions came from, how they shaped Agile’s early days, and why today’s landscape demands a more rigorous focus on competence and continuous learning. 🌱

* * *

## **The Assumptions Made by Agile’s Founders**

The Agile pioneers at Snowbird were highly esteemed professionals—working with the best in their industries. But their selection came with an implicit assumption: that everyone involved in Agile’s growth would be just as competent, curious, and capable.

- **Assumption of Competence**: The expectation was that everyone participating in Agile practices would have a high level of competence.

- **Assumption of Capability**: They believed that people would have the drive and skill to engage deeply with Agile principles.

The reality, however, turned out to be quite different. Many teams and organizations have struggled to live up to these expectations, leading to a competence gap that continues to impact the effectiveness of Agile.

## **Why Continuous Learning Matters in Agile**

For Agile to truly succeed, we need to constantly reassess whether we are on the right path. This requires:

- **Continuous Learning** 📚: We must be committed to learning, experimenting, and adapting.

- **Continuous Validation** ✅: Regularly testing assumptions to ensure we’re moving in the right direction.

- **Closing Learning Loops** 🔄: Adjusting our mental models based on new insights and experiences.

Yet, the world isn't set up to foster this kind of mindset widely. As someone who has seen Agile in action, I can tell you that only about 20% of people are truly committed to this level of continuous improvement. The rest? They often prefer a simpler routine—go to work, get a paycheck, go home.

## **The Supply-Demand Imbalance for Agile Competence**

The demand for Agile professionals has outstripped the supply of truly competent individuals. Here’s where the gap lies:

- **High Demand, Low Supply**: Many companies need Agile leaders, Scrum Masters, and effective doers—developers, product managers, etc.

- **Quality vs. Quantity**: While there’s a plethora of people taking on these roles, the depth of understanding is often lacking.

- **The Role of Communities**: Participating in Agile meetups, reading books, and engaging in discussions are crucial for growth, yet participation remains low.

I remember reading a blog post in my early days that said, “If you're reading this, you’re already in the top 10%.” This resonated with me because it highlights just how rare it is to find people who are genuinely dedicated to continuous improvement.

## **Agile Teams: Special Operations Units** **🛠️**

Think of Agile teams as Special Operations teams:

- **Focused on Value**: Agile teams are meant to maximize value through iterative learning and adaptation.

- **Unique Skillset**: They spend a significant amount of time practicing, learning, and improving.

- **Not the Norm**: Most teams and organizations don’t operate this way. Many struggle to maintain that high level of focus and discipline.

But this is precisely why a Scrum Master is vital—to act as a proxy for that focus and drive. When we find the right people to fill these roles, like Satya Nadella at Microsoft, they can transform an entire organization.

## **The Competence Crisis in Scrum Master Roles**

This gap in competence becomes especially apparent in the role of the Scrum Master. A study from a validation organization found that:

- **39% of Scrum Masters** hadn’t read the Scrum Guide—yes, the basic manual for their role!

- **12% had only a rudimentary understanding** of Scrum, even if they had read the guide.

- **61% were not capable** of effectively fulfilling the role, despite having years of experience.

This is a systemic issue. Organizations have lowered their hiring standards to fill these roles, leading to a large number of people who don’t have the necessary skills to be effective Scrum Masters.

## **Why Hiring Practices Must Change to Fix Agile** **🛠️**

Organizations must rethink their hiring practices for Agile roles:

1. **Hire for Lifelong Learning** 📚: Seek out individuals who actively pursue knowledge—those who read, watch videos, and experiment with new practices.

3. **Raise the Bar for Certifications** 🎓: A two-day course like PSM or CSM Level 1 isn’t enough. Look for advanced certifications like PSM 3, which require deep knowledge and application.

5. **Focus on Contextual Understanding** 🌍:
    - **Product Context**: Does the Scrum Master understand the industry or product domain?
    
    - **Team Context**: Have they worked directly with teams in similar situations?
    
    - **Organizational Context**: Do they know how to drive change within a company’s unique culture?

Satya Nadella is a prime example of someone who embodies these qualities. His engineering background, deep business understanding, and vision for organizational transformation have allowed him to turn Microsoft around successfully.

## **The Role of Competence in Agile Success**

If Agile is to thrive, we need to focus on fostering competence within teams:

- **Encourage Experimentation**: Create a culture where trying new things and failing forward is part of the norm.

- **Invest in People**: Systemic investment in training and development is essential to build the skills required.

- **Promote from Within**: The best candidates for Scrum Master roles are often those who have grown within the team—people who already understand the product, the team dynamics, and the company culture.

I’ve seen firsthand how organizations struggle when they ignore this advice. One memorable instance was when a company promoted an accountant to project manager after a two-day training. It was, as you can imagine, a disaster.

## **Conclusion: A Path Forward for Agile**

The Agile community has come a long way since the early days, but we still face a competence crisis that needs to be addressed head-on. To build truly effective Agile teams, organizations must:

- **Raise the bar for competence**: Don’t settle for basic certifications; look for deep knowledge and experience.

- **Emphasize continuous learning**: Create a culture where growth and adaptation are valued.

- **Hire for context**: Understand that the right Scrum Master needs to align with the team’s needs, the product’s demands, and the organization’s vision.

🚀 By focusing on these areas, we can build a future where Agile truly lives up to its promise—delivering value, adapting continuously, and empowering individuals and teams to thrive. Let’s get back on track, and make Agile what it was always meant to be!
