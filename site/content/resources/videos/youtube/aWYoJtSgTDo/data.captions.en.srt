1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,420
one of my friends tends to say that I

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,820
see agile and scrum everywhere including

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,699
in the including the forest and me going

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,020
to uh to one of my favorite activities

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:26,820
so mushroom foraging and yes I believe

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:29,220
we can learn a lot about agility uh when

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,199
we when we look at what I do especially

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,980
in the autumn in the forest

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,160
so first point you have to choose the

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,140
right environment right territory right

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,780
so

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,739
um you most likely will not find great

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,500
mushrooms in some of the forest so this

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:53,460
is the knowledge that you can either ask

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,660
someone there is some sources of of

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,059
knowledge how to find how to find the

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,699
Forest where there where there will be

18
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,540
some some mushrooms potential mushrooms

19
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,540
there some of the ideas you can quickly

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,360
cut out from your list don't go to the

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,540
city center don't I don't recommend such

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,840
places for mushroom for adding so some

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,720
of the places obviously will not work

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,659
and and when you are coming into the

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,020
forest there are also some other I would

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,560
say learned rules for me

27
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,280
so if you want to explore if you want to

28
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,579
find the best mushrooms well if you just

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,920
stay in the safety zone so close to the

30
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,439
edge of the forest

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,020
my piece of advice as an experienced

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,060
mushroom forager maybe a lot of people

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,600
have been there already

34
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,759
so if you want to achieve more if you

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,700
want to potentially find better

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,899
mushrooms more mushrooms

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,960
leave this comfort zone go deeper

38
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:06,540
explore and when it comes to how do you

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,440
do that well you don't run in the forest

40
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,980
because of many reasons and one of it

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,540
because you want to focus you want to

42
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,300
make small steps you want to sense

43
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,260
environment around you and trust me

44
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,620
sometimes I can even smell good places

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:32,459
where mushrooms can be found so all your

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,180
senses are needed your focus is needed

47
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,640
and you have to be patient so it happens

48
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,160
that sometimes you you are so excited

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,239
you have nice new buckets going to the

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,760
forest and oh well nothing in the

51
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,700
buckets but at least that's a very

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
healthy healthy sport I would I would

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,700
say

54
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,959
so being patient learn how to explore be

55
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,959
careful be focused and

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,280
be prepared that this journey will will

57
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,700
need more time more devotion uh

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,780
definitely you can learn more and gather

59
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,400
more mushrooms if you invest your time

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,400
wisely in that process
