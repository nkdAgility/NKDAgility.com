# The importance of knowing the territory.

#agileleadership is about sensing opportunities, responding to threats, and making valuable decisions even when you don't have all the information you need.

Joanna Plaskonka - #professionalscrumtrainer and #agile expert - talks us through the similarities of navigating new territories and what she has learned through one of her favourite hobbies, mushroom foraging.
