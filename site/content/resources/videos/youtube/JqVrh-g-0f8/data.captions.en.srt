1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:07,020
uh poor product backlog

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,540
um is probably unordered probably the

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,360
stuff that's important is not at the top

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,679
probably the team doesn't understand

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,179
what all the things are in the product

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,039
backlog

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,779
um and the the stakeholders don't

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,820
understand it either

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,859
what's a better idea it was a good

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,939
product backlog look like it looks like

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,619
a well understood ordered list that

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,779
everybody can get behind everybody

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,880
understands whatever what's in there

14
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,920
everybody understands what they need to

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
do to get the things that are in there

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,000
and how they can help and how it

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,260
contributes towards the overall

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,260
organizational goals
