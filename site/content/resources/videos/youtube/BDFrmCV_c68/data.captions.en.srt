1
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:12,160
one of the seven deadly sins of agile is

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,639
pride now you do want to take pride in

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,279
your work we all want to do good things

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,080
we want to believe that the things that

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:24,720
we create are valued but I think the

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,880
pride that's the sin part is blind Pride

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,759
you're taking pride in something without

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,200
actually measuring its outcome right we

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,920
talk about this all the time for for for

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,719
product owners don't just build stuff

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,280
willy-nilly you need to collect the data

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,480
the Telemetry the analysis you have to

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,920
do hypothesis you have to create the

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,680
hypothesis I think this thing if I build

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,760
it is going to add

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,680
value you create it and you don't just

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,120
assume that it's going to make the value

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,519
that you think it is that's Pride

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,600
talking you need to analyze the data and

20
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,040
figure out if that actually did provide

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,680
the value You're Expecting and you need

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,759
to stop investing in something that

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,119
isn't providing the return that you're

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:20,040
expecting it to do another good example

25
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:23,520
of that uh is is H Satia uh writing down

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,280
the cost of Windows phone right writing

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,640
off Nokia for for 8 billion sometimes

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,880
you have to swallow your pride and not

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,240
sink more money into something that's

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,159
not going to provide a return and you

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,880
just have to stop um I used to work at a

32
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,600
at a bank um in the UK in uh near

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Edinburgh and they created they had this

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,439
massive piece of software that basically

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,280
all it did was create forms for

36
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,159
customers to fill out but it was the

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,399
most

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,360
convoluted unusable

39
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,680
unwieldly um I don't I don't know I I'm

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
trying to think of more words to

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,479
describe this Ridiculousness of this

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,280
this software um it

43
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,160
was didn't provide the features that

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:18,319
they actually needed but they'd spent 2

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,200
million on building it so they must use

46
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,200
it we must continue to use it that's

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,879
that sunk cost fallacy right which I

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,959
think is very closely related to Pride

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,200
while we've invested this much money it

50
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,959
must be awesome so we must use it um and

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,560
those are assumptions yeah I think pride

52
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:42,120
pride is how come we we assume stuff we

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,800
assume lots of things the product owner

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,879
assuming that the features the ideas

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,680
that they have are good ones right the

56
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,760
market doesn't always agree um

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,760
developers building

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,720
things in a

59
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,720
way that entertains

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,959
them rather than that actually focuses

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,480
on the value delivered to the business

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,319
um I've been guilty of that many times

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,519
of working on features because they were

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,920
fun not because they provided any value

65
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:20,760
to the customer um done that a ton um so

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,519
you need to be really uh uh careful that

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,000
you don't become too prideful make

68
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,879
assumptions about the products and

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
capabilities that you're building the

70
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:34,519
code that you're writing the the the the

71
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,439
stories that you tell in such a way that

72
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,200
it clouds your view of what's really

73
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,799
going on right because then all you're

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,760
looking at is Vanity metrics you're

75
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,040
you're missing out on what's really

76
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,480
going on so don't be so prideful that

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,280
you miss out on what's really going
