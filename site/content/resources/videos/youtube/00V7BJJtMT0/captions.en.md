Um, so the question was, what is DevOps and how is it different to Agile? I would say fundamentally it's not. Right? Fundamentally, DevOps and Agile is really the same thing. We're solving the same problem, but we're just looking at it from different angles.

So you'll usually find the folks that are very process orientated are like, "Oh yeah, Agile is the thing," and DevOps is, you know, part of that story. It's the automation piece in that story. But then you talk to the DevOps folks and they'll be like, "Oh, DevOps is this big thing and Agile is the process piece in this story."

Um, and I think that for me, having lived both worlds, indicates that it's all the same stuff. We're talking about the same thing. We're trying to solve the same problem. We're telling the same story; we're just coming at it from a different perspective. It's how would technical people solve this problem and how would non-technical people solve this problem?

Right? Although there are non-technical people, a lot of technical people in the Agile space. So, I think of DevOps and Agile as two heads; they're the two sides of a coin, right?

Um, come at it from whatever angle you want. It's the core practices; it's the principles that are behind it that are the thing that we should be focusing on. Everything else is just the [__] we have to do to make those things successful, right?

Um, whether it's getting tools in the DevOps space, whether it's looking at shortening cycle times, it's a big focus in DevOps, or it's systems thinking. In the Agile space, it's more looking at how do we encourage people to take accountability? How do we encourage shared ownership? How do we, um, build an empirical, hypothesis-driven mindset?

Right? Those two things, you can't have one without the other. They both go together. And if you want to be successful at delivering software products, then you need both Agile and DevOps in unison to be able to be successful.
