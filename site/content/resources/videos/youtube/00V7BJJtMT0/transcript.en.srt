1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,679
um so the question was what is devops

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,100
and how is it different to Agile and and

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,100
I I would say fundamentally it's not

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,199
right fundamentally devops and agile

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,560
um is is is really

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,080
the same the same thing

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,279
right we're solving the same problem but

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,099
we're just looking at it from different

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,579
angles so you'll usually find the the

10
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,000
folks that are very process orientated

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,340
are like oh yeah agile is the thing and

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,620
devops is you know part of that story

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,520
it's the the automation piece in that

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,500
story

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,360
but then you talk to the devops folks

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,180
and they'll be like oh devops is this

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,879
big thing and agile is the process piece

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,520
in this in this in this story

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,620
um and I think that that for me

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,140
indicates and having lived Both Worlds

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,000
and indicates that that it's it's all

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,320
the same stuff we're talking about the

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,880
same thing we're trying to solve the

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,340
same problem we're telling the same

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,560
story we're just coming at it from a

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,540
different perspective it's how would

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,860
technical people solve this problem and

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,860
how would uh uh uh

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,920
non-technical people solve this problem

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,720
right although there are non-technical

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,820
people a lot of technical people in the

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,420
agile space so

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,820
um I think of devops and agile as two

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,920
heads they're the the two sides of of a

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,020
coin right

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,100
um come at it from whatever angle you

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,640
want it's the core practices it's the

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,200
the principles that are behind it that

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,900
are the thing that we should be focusing

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
on everything else is just the [Â __Â ]

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,439
we have to do to make those things

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,659
successful right

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,780
um whether it's getting Tools in in the

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,060
devops space whether it's looking at a

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,439
shortening shortening cycle times it's a

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,780
big Focus uh in in in devops or it's and

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,479
systems thinking or in the agile space

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,060
it's more looking at um how do we

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,940
encourage people to take accountability

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,200
how do we encourage shared ownership how

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,560
do we

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,260
um build an empirical High hypothesis

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,599
driven mindset right though those those

54
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,400
two things are you can't have one

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,879
without the other they both go together

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,180
and if you want to be successful at

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,780
delivering software products and then

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:38,280
you need both agile and devops in unison

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,200
to be able to be successful

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,060
