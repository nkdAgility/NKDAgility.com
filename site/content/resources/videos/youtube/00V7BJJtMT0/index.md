# What is DevOps and how is it different to Agile?

One of the primary #agile values is to continuous deliver working, valuable software that delights customers.

In practice, that requires more than simply developing software, it requires an integrated solution that enables the software to run effectively and efficiently.

Many people don't consider the DevOps element of product development, but it is an incredibly important part of ensuring valuable and continuous delivery of working software for clients.

In this short video, Martin Hinshelwood talks about the difference between DevOps and #agile.
