    "reasoning": "The content does not mention Service Level Expectation (SLE) directly or indirectly, nor does it discuss any of the criteria set in the classification definition—such as forecasting cycle time, probability ranges, or references to Kanban, Scrum, or authoritative sources. The main focus is on cultivating patience, trust, and a positive work culture within agile teams, which is outside the strict scope of SLE. While the audience intersects with those interested in agile practices, the content's alignment and depth with respect to SLE are minimal to nonexistent. No penalties were applied as the tone is positive and there is no evidence of outdated nor critical or satirical treatment. The low confidence accurately reflects the lack of relevant signals.",
