    "reasoning": "The content focuses on coaching and leadership qualities for Scrum Masters, emphasizing values like trust, respect, and influence. While it references Agile principles and roles, it does not explicitly discuss first principles as immutable constraints or foundational truths within Lean, Agile, Scrum, or DevOps. Principles are treated more as best practices or team values than as non-negotiable fundamentals. There is no distinction between first principles and other types of guidance. No penalties were applied as the tone and references are current and professional, but the lack of explicit first principle discussion limits alignment, depth, and intent scores. Audience fit is strong, and the discussion is focused, but not on the required core topic.",

While relevant to Agile coaching, it doesn't meet the strict criteria for the 'First Principal' category, resulting in low alignment and confidence.",
