1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,260
it depends what type of coaching we're

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,420
talking about if

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,280
um we're talking about coaching an

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,100
individual

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,359
um then the absolute top thing they need

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,980
is permission

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,939
you don't you don't coach without

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,820
permission that's just rude and comes

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,619
across man it can sometimes comes across

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,719
quite dickish right

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,239
whereas the the I think I think what I'm

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,760
thinking is the the coaching stance is

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
when are you when are you coaching the

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
team

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
like as a group the whole team rather

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,100
than one-on-one coaching the team versus

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,140
uh

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,260
um you know telling them telling them

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,960
stuff teaching the team and I think

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,899
um three things you need to learn are

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,660
are to listen you need to listen to the

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,940
team and not just listen to respond but

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,619
you need to listen to understand one of

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,659
the problems that the people on the team

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,400
have what are the problems in their

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,659
interactions with themselves between

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
each other

28
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,479
um outside of the team how how do you

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,640
understand the dynamic right so

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,500
listening to the team is is is really

31
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,360
important

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,580
um

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,220
another top thing

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,799
I think is the understanding of what is

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,380
it that the team are doing

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,060
um for me I would maybe put that one

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,920
first although I thought of the other

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,979
one first but I would put this one

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,560
probably pretty high on the list that

40
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,259
as a scrum master

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,840
you're leading

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,939
therefore

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,119
you lead from credibility you don't lead

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,460
from

45
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,560
mediocrity right you need to you need to

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,759
be credible within the space that you're

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,399
leading people

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,040
so do you understand what it is they do

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,259
how they do it what the trials and

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,479
tribulations are what does good look

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,759
like for the type of work that the team

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,380
is working on

53
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,380
um and and and how

54
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,660
what does good look like and how can you

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,700
engage with the team in a way that

56
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,560
enables them

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,720
to do more of the right thing and less

58
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,879
of the wrong thing thanks for watching
