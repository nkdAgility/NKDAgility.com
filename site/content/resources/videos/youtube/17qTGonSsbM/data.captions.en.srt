1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,279
so there's a quote from Lau which is if

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,120
you do not change direction you may end

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,160
up where you're heading and I think

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,080
that's that's

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,720
absolutely absolutely a thing we have to

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,800
be concerned with we want to be

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,400
continuously asking

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,000
ourselves are we going in the right

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,840
direction and that that can be asked at

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,080
at many levels right I can be a a a a

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,760
developer building um product and I'm

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,719
writing code and am I writing the right

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,600
code am I taking this product in the

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,559
right direction am I making the right

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,960
architectural choices am I making the

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,600
right security choices right because you

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
don't want to head in that that

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,800
direction where you end up at the end of

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,480
a product cycle you're shipping your

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,199
product uh to a bunch of a bunch of

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,480
users and the there's security flaws and

22
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,320
there's usability issues and there's cuz

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,440
we've not been heading in the right

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,159
Direction and and that's also true at

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,720
the at the product owner level right are

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,000
we building the right features in our

27
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,920
product are we going in the right

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,200
direction to to maximize our ability to

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
to to provide benefit in the market and

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,720
thus have lots of people use our product

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,799
and it also works at the organizational

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,000
level um are are are are we as a

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,439
business focused on the right Vision are

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,479
we going in the right direction and

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,280
quite often lots of organiz ations head

36
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:36,240
off the

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,479
cliff and don't change direction right

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,840
they forget to look at the data they

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,840
forget that the world is ever changing

40
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,680
and ever

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,680
Dynamic um and that where you thought

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,840
you were going might not be the right

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,200
place for you there's a great example

44
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,960
it's a product I use uh called it used

45
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,320
to be called zoom. a nothing to do with

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,280
uh Zoom the video conferencing tool um

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,799
but it allowed you it was BAS basically

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,840
a an AI um assistant that would help you

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,959
with booking your meetings so you could

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,319
add them on on teams you could add them

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,879
on whatever chat platforms you've got

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,680
and I could just message it and say uh

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,160
you know set me up a meeting with uh uh

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,920
with Satia at 3:00 on Thursday right and

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,920
it would go off and it would email Satia

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,000
and say you know we've got this meeting

57
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
to set up um how would you like it to to

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,640
be you want to pick your pick your valid

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,080
options and it would figure out from

60
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,239
everybody's valid options what's a good

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,560
time uh uh to host that meeting and then

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,239
it would just book it right it would

63
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,760
book it straight into your calendar and

64
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,480
and and book it um but they they

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,080
realized that that's not how people use

66
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,319
their product most people that used

67
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,400
their product just went to the website

68
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,319
and booked through the website right

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,599
they they they literally went new

70
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,080
meeting here's who I want to attend

71
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,720
submit and that would go off and do it

72
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,040
so they weren't going going through the

73
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,000
chatbot so the chatbot was largely

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
irrelevant to their business outcome to

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,480
the thing that they were delivering that

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,080
people were using was largely irrelevant

77
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,640
um so they actually changed their whole

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,640
business strategy in order to fit how

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,400
people were using their product right

80
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,560
they're taking advantage of an

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,239
opportunity that arose instead of

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,239
heading in the direction that they were

83
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,439
heading they pivoted maybe not far right

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,120
but they pivoted over to a different

85
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,080
direction and they actually renamed

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,560
their entire organization they they they

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,239
reasserted all of their interfaces and

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,000
stuff around this this this is the

89
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,319
Paradigm that people are actually using

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,280
in our product and

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,000
that's something that lots of

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,319
organizations don't do um what's a good

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,079
example of things not happening that way

94
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,400
are the oh I'm not going to remember the

95
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,000
dude's name

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
um but the the the the the dude that was

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,799
doing the high jump and he was doing the

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,040
high jump everybody at the time was

99
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,480
doing the high jump one leg

100
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,040
first right um and he started doing it

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,759
he was the first person to start going

102
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,959
backwards doing the back flip over the

103
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,160
high jump and he was winning gold medal

104
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,960
and totally outing all of the comp like

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,160
going far higher than everybody else for

106
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,199
10 years

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
before everybody else went oh actually

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,440
we maybe we should do it that way maybe

109
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,880
maybe that's better he seems to be

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,280
getting better results why does it take

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,400
10 years because this is the way we've

112
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,199
always done things we're going in that

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,600
direction and we like to keep going in

114
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,400
that direction that's our comfortable is

115
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,600
to keep doing the thing that we've

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,680
always been doing and perhaps keep doing

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
the thing you've always been doing is

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,199
going the wrong way if you want to have

119
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,880
