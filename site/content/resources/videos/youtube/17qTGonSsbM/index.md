As Lao Tzu wisely said, _“If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.”_ This quote resonates deeply with me, both as a professional [Scrum]({{< ref "/categories/scrum" >}}) trainer and a practitioner. Whether you're a developer writing code or an organization strategizing for the future, it's vital to continuously ask yourself: **Are we heading in the right direction?** 🛤️

In this post, we’ll explore why it’s crucial to evaluate your direction regularly at different levels—individual, team, and organizational—and how you can pivot when necessary to achieve better outcomes.

## **Hitting the Target as a Developer** **🎯**

At the developer level, the idea of assessing direction is highly applicable. When you're deep into coding, it's easy to focus on _just_ delivering features and forget to evaluate whether you're making the right choices along the way. Here are some key questions you should ask:

- **Am I writing the right code?**

- **Is this the right approach for this feature?**

- **Are there better architectural or security decisions I could be making?**

One personal experience I often share is when a team I was working with delivered a product that, while feature-rich, was riddled with security flaws. Despite excellent feature development, the oversight in security direction led to customer dissatisfaction and extra work post-launch. This is why we must constantly reevaluate our progress. The worst case? You could end up delivering a product with functionality, but it's insecure, buggy, or unusable for your target audience. 😱

### **Key Takeaways for Developers:**

- Regularly check if your code aligns with the product vision.

- Ensure that architectural and security choices are sound.

- Don’t wait until the end of the product cycle to assess usability and security issues—fix them along the way.

## **Product Owners: Are You Building the Right Features?** **🚀**

The same principle applies to product owners. It’s easy to get tunnel vision, especially when you're committed to delivering certain features. But the real question is: **Are you building the right features that truly benefit your users?**

I remember working with a [product owner]({{< ref "/tags/product-owner" >}}) who was keen on adding more features to a product. The team built these out with speed and efficiency, but the customers weren’t interested in using them. The product was feature-packed, yet didn’t solve the key pain points of its users. Had we stopped to evaluate direction, we would have realized this much sooner.

### **Product Owner's Evaluation Checklist:**

- **Does this feature align with customer needs?**

- **Is this the right time to introduce this feature, or could resources be better spent elsewhere?**

- **What feedback are we receiving, and are we truly listening?**

💡 **Pro tip**: Constantly monitor market trends and feedback. Don’t assume the path you’re on is the right one just because it worked in the past. Products and users evolve, and so should your direction!

## **The Organizational Level: Avoiding the Cliff** **🏢🕳****️**

On a larger scale, entire organizations sometimes fail to course-correct. They are so set on their established strategy that they overlook the shifts in market dynamics, customer needs, or even technological advancements. This stubbornness often leads them off a cliff. 📉

A memorable example comes from a company I worked with that built an AI assistant for booking meetings. It was a brilliant idea: the bot could schedule meetings for you through chat platforms like Teams. However, after analyzing user behavior, they realized most customers preferred booking meetings directly on the website. The chatbot feature, once seen as innovative, was barely used. Instead of doubling down on the chatbot, the company pivoted its strategy, rebranding itself and realigning the product with actual customer behaviors.

### **Lessons for Organizations:**

- **Don’t fear change**. Sometimes, your best-laid plans might not align with reality, and that's okay!

- **Gather and analyze data** to understand how users are interacting with your product.

- **Be adaptable**. If the data suggests a change in direction, embrace it.

### **Case Study: The High Jumper Who Changed the Game**

If you’re looking for a historical example of direction change, the story of Dick Fosbury, the Olympic high jumper, is a perfect analogy. In the 1960s, high jumpers would leap over the bar with one leg leading. But Fosbury introduced the _Fosbury Flop_, a revolutionary technique where the athlete jumps backwards over the bar. He won gold medals and broke records using this method, yet it took **10 years** before others adopted it! 🤯

Why? Because people were comfortable with the old way, even if it wasn’t the best way. This highlights an important lesson: doing things the same way for the sake of comfort can prevent innovation and success. Don’t wait 10 years to change direction when a better way is clearly visible.

## **Pivoting: Knowing When It’s Time to Change ⏳****🔄**

So how do you know when it’s time to pivot?

- **Listen to feedback**. Whether it’s from your customers, team members, or the market, feedback is invaluable. If the data is telling you something, don’t ignore it.

- **Regular retrospectives**. Scrum offers us the chance to reflect and adapt at regular intervals. Make sure your team is not just going through the motions but is genuinely evaluating the direction.

- **Embrace flexibility**. Being too rigid in your strategy could lead to failure. Sometimes small pivots, like the AI assistant example, can make all the difference.

### **Practical Tips for Agile Teams:**

- Schedule frequent retrospectives to evaluate direction.

- Don’t be afraid to abandon a feature or project that isn’t working.

- Foster a culture where feedback is embraced, not feared.

## **Final Thoughts: Direction Determines Destination 🧭**

Whether you're a developer, a product owner, or leading an organization, one truth remains: **Direction determines destination.** If you don’t assess where you're heading, you could end up in a place you don’t want to be.

To recap:

- **Developers**: Always ensure your code aligns with the overall vision and product goals.

- **Product Owners**: Build features that add real value, not just more complexity.

- **Organizations**: Stay flexible and open to change; otherwise, you risk driving off the cliff.

It’s crucial to take a step back, evaluate, and be willing to adjust your course. As Lao Tzu suggests, if you don’t change direction, you may end up somewhere you don’t want to be. And nobody wants that, right? 🚫
