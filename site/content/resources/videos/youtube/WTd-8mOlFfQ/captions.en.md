Another common mistake that Scrum Masters make is being the team secretary, filling out, being the Jira admin, right? Being the admin for the team and filling out their Jira tickets for them, doing reporting for them, doing all those things. Don't do any of that crap; it's totally pointless. There might be organisational reasons why it has to happen, but the focus for the Scrum Master should be on the effectiveness of the team, not on doing stuff for them.
