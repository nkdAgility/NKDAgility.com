1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,120
another common mistake that scrum

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,519
Masters make is uh being being the team

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,679
secretary

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,660
uh filling out being being the jira

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,420
admin right being the admin for the team

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,900
and uh filling out their jira tickets

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,060
for them doing reporting for them uh

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,939
doing all those things don't do any of

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,680
that crap it's totally pointless

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,740
um there might be organizational reasons

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,560
why it has to happen uh but the the the

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,500
focus for the scrum Master should be on

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,640
the effectiveness of the team not on

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,640
doing stuff for them
