    "reasoning": "The content examines mistakes Scrum Masters make, specifically avoiding administrative duties to improve team effectiveness. However, there are no direct references to customer value, customer outcomes, or customer-centric practices. The focus remains entirely on team roles and internal effectiveness, with no discussion or evidence of how these actions connect to or are evaluated by customer needs or outcomes. While it addresses improving Scrum Master performance, it doesn't tie this to any customer focus themes or measurements as defined by the classification. The small score increments reflect loose, indirect alignment in that effective teams might support customer value, but this is neither explicit nor explored.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This piece is about internal team roles and avoiding admin tasks as a Scrum Master. It doesn’t discuss customer needs, outcomes, or value delivery, so it weakly fits the 'Customer Focus' category.",

    "reasoning": "The content is focused on advising Scrum Masters against common mistakes, specifically avoiding administrative tasks. It frames these recommendations as important professional behaviors but never discusses or identifies first principles directly or indirectly. The material doesn’t attempt to define foundational, immutable constraints (first principles) but instead centers on practical advice and best practices for the Scrum Master role. The language used is prescriptive but contextually driven, referencing situational pitfalls rather than expounding on foundational truths. No penalties for outdatedness or tone are applicable.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content offers practical advice for Scrum Masters but doesn't identify or apply first principles as foundational, immutable constraints. Its focus is on context-dependent best practices, so confidence in the fit with the 'First Principal' category is very low.",
