There are no direct mentions of OKRs, nor is there conceptual alignment with the theory, system, or practices of Objective Key Results as defined by John Doerr. While there is some overlap in improvement philosophy, there is no explicit or implicit OKR reference, outcome-based measurement linkage, or discussion of strategic alignment and stretch goals. The audience is generally practitioners interested in Kanban and process optimization, not those seeking OKR-specific guidance.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on practical tips for visualising and customising Kanban boards to improve team efficiency and process clarity. While it references continuous improvement and encourages team adaptation, it does not mention Agentic Engineering or its philosophical underpinnings. There is no discussion of developer autonomy, ethical AI, systemic observability, or decentralised decision-making. Audience and signal-to-noise ratios are higher due to relevance for practitioners, but there is minimal alignment or depth regarding Agentic Engineering’s core themes.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This practical Kanban guide provides workflow visualisation tips aimed at improving team efficiency, but it does not engage with the core ideas, philosophy, or terminology of Agentic Engineering. Its focus is operational, not agentic, resulting in low category confidence.",
