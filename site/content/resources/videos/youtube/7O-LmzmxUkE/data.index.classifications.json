The signal-to-noise ratio is low for SLE: most of the content is on event philosophy and practices, not flow metrics or service expectations. No penalties were applied as the content is neither outdated nor critical toward SLE.

The article doesn't explore foundational constraints or non-negotiable principles but does indirectly reference the immutable nature of empiricism in Scrum.
