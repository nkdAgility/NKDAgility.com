1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,240
there's a myth in scrum that you spend

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:14,920
more time talking than doing I see this

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,680
quite a lot people talking usually

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,080
people are using old school terminology

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,760
when you hear them talking about that

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,199
you hear them talking about ceremonies

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,359
right rather than events and one of the

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:32,920
main reasons why scrum doesn't call the

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,760
the activity the events ceremonies is

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,320
because it's ceremonies we get together

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,879
and nothing happens it's a ceremony it's

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,480
something we do that's perhaps the same

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,680
every time and there's no actual outcome

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,559
to a ceremony apart from maybe people

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,800
have some jollies and they feel good

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:57,079
right um the reason scrum calls them

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,320
events and also not meetings the reason

18
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,359
they're called events is something's

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,560
supposed to to happen

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,720
there every single one of the scrum

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,159
events serves

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,400
empiricism that's their purpose right

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,720
you're going to inspect something and

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
adapt

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,119
something if you're not

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,079
adapting there's no point in being there

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,200
there's no point in having it there's no

28
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:30,640
point in doing it their purpose is to

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:33,079
adapt so for example at your Sprint

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,399
planning you're inspecting your product

31
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,560
backlog and your product goal and you're

32
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,640
adapting your Sprint back clog in your

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,920
Sprint goal you that emerges through

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,799
that con perhaps through that

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,119
conversation right but at the end of

36
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,240
your Sprint planning you should have a

37
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,840
Sprint

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,719
goal you should have selected backlog

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,920
items what do the developers think best

40
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
serves work working towards the product

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,799
goal and you should have some kind of a

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,560
starter plan to complete them if those

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,080
three things don't exist at the end of

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,760
Sprint planning there was no point in

45
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,440
having it that's what it's there for so

46
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,959
that we understand what it is we're

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,879
going to take into the next Sprint so

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,160
that we can communicate that perhaps

49
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,360
with other people what's our goal for

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
this Sprint what are we trying to

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,800
achieve how do you get the stakeholders

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,160
to actually turn up for the Sprint

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
review well you have to give them

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,879
something that they're interested in

55
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,720
coming and Fe providing feedback on

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,159
that's your Sprint goal right and that's

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,800
just one of the events in scrum every

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:45,040
sing your daily scrum it's only 15

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,720
minutes how does that add up to a

60
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:54,040
boatload of meetings at most 15 minutes

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,920
per day where the team gets together and

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,480
plans the next 24 hours that's its

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,959
purpose you're inspecting your exist

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,319
Sprint back

65
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,840
clog and you're adapting that Sprint

66
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,480
back clog based on what you learned in

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,200
the last 24 hours you might have learned

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,560
some stuff from actually working on the

69
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,920
product what can and cannot be done you

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,440
might have uh uh gained more information

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,319
and insight from other stakeholders and

72
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,920
collaborating with the business and

73
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,519
doing analysis on what it is you're

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
going to work on that means that

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
something that you've got in the Sprint

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,239
needs to be taken out because it's no

77
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
longer viable or something else needs to

78
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,720
be brought in in because it becomes part

79
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,120
of that that story of what it is you're

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,400
trying to achieve that

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,640
Sprint that's your daily

82
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,239
scrum right it's not an elaborate status

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,840
event it's not a time that you're

84
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,720
wasting it's where you're maintaining

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,120
the transparency that is required to be

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,799
able to inspect and adapt you're serving

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,760
empiricism and all of the scrum events

88
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,599
