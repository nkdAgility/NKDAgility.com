    "reasoning": "The content primarily discusses Kanban and its advantages over traditional project management, with only brief mentions of Scrum. While it touches on the concept of Scrum as a potential strategy for organisations, it does not delve into the core principles, roles, events, or artifacts of Scrum. The discussion lacks depth regarding Scrum's framework and practices, leading to a low confidence score in its alignment with the Scrum category.",
