The closest the text comes is in referencing the collection and analysis of cycle time and workflow metrics—yet these are generalized flow metrics discussions, not about SLE specifically. The article targets practitioners interested in Kanban, matching the audience somewhat, but remains focused on adoption and incremental improvement, not on the core concepts, calculation, or application of SLE.
