1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,920
so the question is if you're working in

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,000
traditional a traditional project

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,760
management world I know everybody has

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,280
quams about the word traditional but

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,920
what people have always done um

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,439
traditional project management world and

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,400
you're I guess daunted by this idea of

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,880
of of agile and the changes that need to

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,759
happen in order to get there then

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,559
probably a a a cand strategy is is a way

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:35,640
that you can gain

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,280
benefits over over over a longer period

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,239
of time so what lots of lots of teams

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,000
and organizations get benefit from

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,480
jumping to a scrum process right it it

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,160
it highlights where you've got problems

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,239
it very quickly identifies things in

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,199
your organization that inhibit the

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,680
ability for you to move towards towards

20
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,199
an agal process but quite often

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,199
depending on the organization that can

22
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,519
be too much too fast um you you can end

23
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,200
up with just bad scrum right we we we

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,159
we're going to call everything with the

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,600
agile terminology use use the scrum

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,600
terminology but in actual fact uh we're

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,920
not going actually going to make any

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,479
changes to the way we do things so maybe

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,159
a better approach for those types of

30
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,960
organizations that don't have the

31
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,240
willingness to change and by the way the

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,240
best time to change the way you do

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,280
things in an organization is when your

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,840
organization has completely and utterly

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,680
failed to deliver or achieve something

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,399
that's when people are most open to

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,240
change so that's where you might bring

38
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:41,680
in a radically different process like

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,399
scrum uh but the advantage of a cand

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,159
strategy is you start from where you are

41
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:52,200
right now cand strategy does not require

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,200
you to change the way anybody

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,799
works I'll I'll I'll say that again a

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,039
cban strategy applying a cand strategy

45
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,240
creating and applying a cand strategy

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,799
does not require anybody in your

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,960
organization to change the way they work

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,319
right

49
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,920
now that's really important to

50
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:16,120
understand caman is not a way of doing

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:19,599
things it's not a process in itself it's

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,959
observational it observes your existing

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,440
process and gives you data and

54
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,760
information about how effective it is

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,840
being that's the purpose of a CA

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,200
strategy so you don't need to change the

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,800
way you work you just need to document

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,519
how you work right now that's your

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,959
definition of workflow right you write

60
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
down how you work right now and then you

61
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,440
need to collect some

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,840
metrics once you've collected those

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,519
metrics you're going to look at

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,800
them and you're going to see if there

65
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,319
are any patterns that allow you to

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,519
identify things that need to change

67
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,519
that's

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,879
it so one person you as the project

69
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,480
manager in your

70
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,000
organization can

71
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,000
yourself Implement parts of a cand

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
strategy you can at least collect the

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,400
data right you can you can load it out

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,000
of jira or as your devops into tools um

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,360
you can you can you can pull it into a

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,440
spreadsheet and figure this stuff out

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,159
right so you have the the start date and

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,200
the end date the age of the work items

79
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,120
because you get the start date and the

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,239
end date you get the cycle time right

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,239
how long things take to go through the

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,560
process and then you can do some data

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,879
analysis on

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,159
that you can start to you can you can

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,560
you can plot it in a in a cycle time

86
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,000
scatter plot and look for outliers

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,319
there's a number of graphs that you

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,840
would definitely use within the context

89
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,599
of caman and each of those graphs are

90
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,400
there to visualize the flow of work

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,120
through your system right once you

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,879
visualize the flow of work through your

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,040
existing system that you've not changed

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,519
how everybody

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,799
works you'll then see things that you

96
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,760
want to have a conversation about it's

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,200
it's actually quite quite uh

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,920
startling how easy it is once you point

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,079
out once you do the graph and somebody

100
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,959
like like myself who's been trained to

101
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,400
read the graphs and have read graphs

102
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,400
from lots of teams point at some things

103
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,440
and say what's this why why is this

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,800
group of things kind of like this and

105
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,360
then you're like oh yeah I I can see

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,120
that too it's very once you understand

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,160
the patterns that you're looking for

108
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,880
it's very easy to

109
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,639
identify at least initially right when

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,440
we're when we've not made any changes to

111
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,520
the system it's very easy to identify

112
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,639
anomalies it's it's going to be super

113
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,479
obvious you'll have you'll have things

114
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,880
like lots of dots clumped together

115
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,360
you're like what's that well that was a

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,880
release okay well is that the best way

117
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,039
to do that or you've got all of these

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,479
dots way up up on your your your cycle

119
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,360
time scatter plot cuz they took a really

120
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,120
long time to complete it's like why did

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,720
these all take a long time to complete

122
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,080
well we've got to get the Architectural

123
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,919
Review Board to approve this thing um

124
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,120
and they they only sit once every six

125
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,960
months oh right so you can only get

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,400
architectural stuff approved once every

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,280
six months what happens if you need a

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,639
change in between sorry I'm using this

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,280
example because I worked in this

130
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,560
environment what happens if you need a

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,400
change in between well you need to stop

132
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,840
work put it into the Architectural

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,319
Review Board and they meet every six

134
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,759
months so you need to wait and it it

135
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,080
could take years to deliver a a product

136
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,360
because you need to make changes to

137
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,520
it those types of things you probably

138
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,080
already know some of them right you

139
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,000
already know that some of those things

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,240
in your organization are broken you know

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,479
it handan strategy will give you the

142
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,600
data to prove it and if you can prove it

143
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,680
you can put it in front of somebody who

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,800
can do something about it and say look

145
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,039
at the data I would like to run an

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,440
experiment stuff's taking a really long

147
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,039
time to complete I think this is the

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
problem this data is telling me that

149
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,840
this is the problem I'd like to change

150
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,199
this and we can see if the data

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
improves you just Chang your

152
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,680
system you just

153
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,919
optimized your

154
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,319
system keep doing that and you'll get to

155
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,120
the most optimal system

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,919
for the type of work that you're doing

157
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,560
which will be different for every team

158
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,080
every group everybody right but that's

159
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,840
how you make that transition you need to

160
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,560
understand how the system works in order

161
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,639
to be able to make the

162
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,440
change so how long would it take to

163
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,080
transition from traditional uh uh

164
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,720
project management to cban as long as it

165
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,960
takes right you optimize as much as you

166
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,039
need at whatever speed you

167
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,720
want and that that's up to you if your

168
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,080
current system of work is failing you

169
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,759
then you would benefit from creating and

170
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,720
applying a camand strategy our

171
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,639
professional cand trainers and

172
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,280
Consultants are ready to help don't wait

173
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,280

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,280
improve get in touch below
