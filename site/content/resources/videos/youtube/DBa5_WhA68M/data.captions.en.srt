1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,160
one of the things to teach a product

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,720
owner Apprentice is

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,719
negotiation negotiation is something

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,280
that as a product owner really as any

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,520
team member but especially as a product

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,720
owner you're going to be using

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,640
constantly um you're going to have to

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,960
negotiate with the developers on your

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
team you're going to have to negotiate

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
with your stakeholders you're going to

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,199
have to negotiate with leadership in

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,440
your organization if you as a product

13
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:36,600
owner want to be able to

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,360
influence the things in your

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,840
organization that affect your ability to

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,719
deliver value even if you don't control

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,000
them you need to understand how to

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,000
negotiate and engage with the people who

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,160
can so negotiation is really important

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,920
so as a product owner Apprentice there's

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,039
a great book um I'm trying to remember

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,800
the author uh but the title is never

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,560
split the difference a never split the

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,240
difference is about negotiation it's

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,520
written by the FBI's head hostage

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,040
negotiator for the last 20 years and he

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,080
talks about it as whether you're

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,840
negotiating bedtime for your kids or

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,320
negotiating hostage release is the same

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
tools and techniques that you use um he

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,119
has a a masterclass on

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,920
masterclass.com um and what you need to

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,600
consider as a product owner and if

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,200
you're helping out an apprentice product

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,960
owner they need to understand the

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,399
ramifications of the decisions that

37
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,880
they're making and how to engage in

38
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:50,320
communication that gets them to an

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,520
effective result right so just because a

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,240
a a stakeholder wants something even if

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
they're the CEO doesn't mean it's a good

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,520
idea to build it it just doesn't mean

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,200
it's a good idea to do it

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,320
but you might not be able to just say no

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,239
to that

46
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,039
person what are the tools and techniques

47
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,400
that you build as an individual to help

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,480
you make help you

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,840
enable that other person to withdraw the

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,400
request is the way I think about it

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,040
right you don't want to say no you want

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,400
them to say no um if so you might not

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,319
start with uh saying no you might start

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,480
with asking them questions about what it

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,720
is they expect to achieve from that

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,120
thing and when they don't know the

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,599
answers that could be a good indication

58
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,360
that it's not well thought through

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
perhaps you sit with them and do a lean

60
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,080
business canvas what information do they

61
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,000
need for example the CEO if you're an

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,400
apprentice product owner you're not

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,760
going to be able to say no to the CEO

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,920
what do they need to

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,840
understand themselves so that they say

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,640
no that that's what you need to enable

67
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,720
as a product owner you need to enable

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,080
their understanding so that they realize

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,959
that that's not the outcome that they're

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,560
trying to achieve and if you're you're

71
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,560
you want them to say yes to something if

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,040
you're the product owner asking for more

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
money or asking for new features or

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
asking for a different name for your

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,000
product or more budget whatever those

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,080
things are you don't want to start by

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,720
just asking a question that has a yes or

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,200
no response will you give me the money

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,200
for this no right you want to figure out

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,599
how do you get to yes and it's not

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,640
always a straight line that's what

82
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,159
negotiation is all about so this these

83
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,040
are fantastic

84
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,640
skills that you need to learn and we do

85
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,920

scrum product owner class uh we don't

87
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,159
dive that deeply right I mean we've got

88
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,319
a two-day class you can't really dive

89
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,760
too deep ly into some of these topics

90
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,159
but what we do cover is what is what are

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,720
the things that you need to understand

92
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,799
and where can you find the additional

93
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,400
information that you need to to engage

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,840

engage with people in your organization

102
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,720
and how you improve those techniques

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,280
over time that's the value of

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,400
negotiation and as a product owner

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,639

you've been a product owner for a while

108
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,240
and you're struggling to engage with

109
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
people and

110
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,639
