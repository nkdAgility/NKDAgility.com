1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
and but i mean fundamentally the

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
definition of done is the work we're

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,519
going to do

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
so and that's very different than what

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,240
the the people that asked us for

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,320
something

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,520
they need the content of what they've

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,960
asked for

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
that's important but how are we going to

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,080
create it and so thinking about that is

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,599
our definition of done

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
what is the least amount of work we

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,880
could do

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,800
in order to to validate the hypothesis

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,360
but also produce

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
the quality of the work that's necessary

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,840
to be usable

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,239
in a sustainable way for that end user

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,239
customer

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
my name is mark naumann and i work at

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
smn consulting

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,559
and um my background is electrical

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
engineering and software development and

24
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,640
i've been working with folks to adopt

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
scrum and agile practices and get better

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,440
at it for

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,600
gosh about almost 20 years and

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
focused in as a professional scrum

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,479
trainer here for the past

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
uh about eight years or so and had a lot

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,920
of experience with

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
data development particularly data

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,040
warehouse business intelligence

34
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,799
report writing things like that both

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
from the perspective of working on teams

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,240
doing that work

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
as well as working with teams as an

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,920
agile coach and consultant helping them

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
figure out how to get better agile

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
business results

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
in that particular problem space

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
well and for people that are familiar

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,720
with software it's

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
it's for the same reason that we want

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,479
the the

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,960
i'll call it the technical quality of

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,680
the work that the team is doing

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,520
is developing is appropriate and ready

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,880
for the customer to actually use it and

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,799
get benefit out of it whatever the

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,719
benefit is

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,880
so in the case of data

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,119
we have to go through a certain number

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
of technical steps some tasks that we

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
have to perform

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
in order to get to that level of

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
technical quality we're going to be

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
extracting some data we're going to be

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,640
transforming it we're going to be

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,400
loading it in we're going to be creating

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
reports on that data

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
the reporting data is going to be

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,319
formatted in a certain way

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,640
when the data changes we have to ensure

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,800
that those changes are actually

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,040
visible in the report so that the report

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
can show updates on a regular basis or

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,480
trends if it's

69
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,480
visualizing the data as many reports do

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,640
and what data we're looking at is a

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,319
different question

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,360
what what metrics the user wants to get

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480
out of the data

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,239
is a different question the way that

75
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,519
they're seeing that data is a different

76
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
question those are all what

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
questions and in scrum those what

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,280
questions are answered

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,080
on the product backlog but whatever it

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,360
is that the

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
that the end user of our report usually

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,120
in the type of data we're talking about

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,040
it culminates in some form of a report

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,599
it could be an online dashboard

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
it could be a a pdf file that's

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,239
generated periodically

87
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,519
it could just be data ready for

88
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,640
consumption through

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,760
an api but whatever that

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,360
end result is that we're going to define

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,599
that by the product backlog

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,120
and we want it to be consumable at a

93
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,799
level of quality

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,480
that meets the needs and expectations of

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,680
the end user so

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,239
we have to make sure that we've

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
tested it properly we have to make sure

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,040
that we've done

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
whatever cleanup is necessary to the

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,440
standards that we've established for

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
ourselves

102
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,360
that infers that we have standards so

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,440
maybe the standards are set by the

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,879
organization

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
that's pretty common in fact if you look

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
at the scrum guide when it talks about

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
the definition of done

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
it says that if the development

109
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,480
organization has a definition of done

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,640
then that's the definition we need to

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
live up to but if there isn't

112
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,080
a definition of done from the

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
organization then the scrum

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
team needs to ensure they've defined

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
what will

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
constitute done work so if we haven't

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,480
done adequate testing

118
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,879
if we haven't validated that it

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,840
produces the the type of information

120
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,600
that

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,799
is needed at the precision and accuracy

122
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
those are concerns that we have

123
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
particularly in the data world um

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,199
that we're expecting uh for this

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
particular application type

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,479
then it's not done and that means if

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
it's not done

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
that we can't deliver it or at least we

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
should not deliver it at least in a

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
well-formed

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,520
team that's executing scrum correctly we

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
would not ever deliver done work

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,080
we won't present done work uh i'm sorry

134
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
undone work is what i meant to say and

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,639
at the sprint review we're not going to

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
review undone work we're only going to

137
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960
look at done work

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,759
and in the words of scrum uh in the

139
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
increment

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,840
that we develop this particular sprint

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
only done work is included in that

142
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
increment

143
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
and it happens sometimes especially

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
early on in scrum adoption that we

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
will work during a sprint to try to

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
produce

147
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,520
done work but we don't get all the way

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,720
there we we're not able to complete all

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,880
of the tasks

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,080
necessary to get to our agreed upon

151
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,600
definition of done

152
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
maybe there were some tests we couldn't

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
perform or maybe

154
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
maybe there has to be an approval in our

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,600
environment i'm not encouraging that

156
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
but sometimes in some environments we

157
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,680
have to get some kind of review or

158
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,120
approval process that has to happen

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,639
and if that's part of our definition of

160
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
done and we have not done that yet the

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,639
work's not done

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
now that means it can't be in the

163
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
increment at least in well

164
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,199
in a mature scrum environment we're not

165
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
going to talk about it is done we can

166
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,080
talk about the fact that we worked on

167
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,840
this particular

168
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,520
aspect of the data but we didn't get

169
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,680
there that's fine

170
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,680
we'll be transparent about it of course

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
and whatever work remains for that

172
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
particular valuable piece of work it's

173
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,680
going to go back on the product backlog

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,520
and the product owner can validate that

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
it's still the most important work

176
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,759
or not the most important work anymore

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
and then in our future sprints we'll

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,680
continue that work as appropriate or

179
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
either next sprint or later whatever it

180
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,039
is

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,919
so that it's really useful to separate

182
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,680
the idea of

183
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,120
what we need to do and why we need to do

184
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,319
it and that's represented on the product

185
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
backlog

186
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,520
and um what is the work this team is

187
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,960
going to do

188
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,800
in order to make it usable to our

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
standards for the end user

190
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,080
and thinking about the end user is

191
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
really important that could be an end

192
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
customer

193
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
it could be a manager in the

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,039
organization it could be another system

195
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
in the organization that uses the data

196
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,960
that this team provides

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,440
in order to do other things for whoever

198
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,039
customers or other stakeholders

199
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
so think about that think about the what

200
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
versus the ha the that

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,840
how we're doing the work itself that's

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
the definition of done

203
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,280
well typically there's a sequence of

204
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,960
steps that

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,479
teams are already familiar with that

206
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,240
work in this space

207
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,400
if it's a data warehouse or business

208
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,639
intelligence or goes by different names

209
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,199
in some areas

210
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,680
um they probably have a way of working

211
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
and

212
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
even though they're going maybe they're

213
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
adopting scrum those tasks that they

214
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
used to perform

215
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
all need to happen now the thing is

216
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
because we're working in these small

217
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,080
increments and we're trying to

218
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,919
produce bits of value and deliver them

219
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
early and often so that we can get

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,599
feedback

221
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
and use empiricism to inspect and adapt

222
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
our progress

223
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
toward the you know the big goals we

224
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,319
have for this particular

225
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,240
product um

226
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,160
we probably have to apply those tasks in

227
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,440
a bit of a different way

228
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
and uh we the etl acronym still works

229
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,879
you know extract

230
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,319
transform load now in business

231
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,680
intelligence there's additional things

232
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,879
we have to do in terms of

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,360
report creation all of the steps that we

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
did

235
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,000
in identifying the data sources

236
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,919
connecting to those data sources

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
extracting data elements from those

238
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,199
sources

239
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,919
evaluating the quality of that data

240
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
and then performing transformation steps

241
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,919
by

242
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,599
joining data sources together

243
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,000
manipulating the data through

244
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,199
whatever means could be through you know

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
elaborate formula

246
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,319
it could be very simple transformations

247
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,560
of just lookups

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,479
and then of course loading it into a new

249
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
data which requires that there be a data

250
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
model that can contain the data

251
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,360
and that data model has to have all the

252
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,880
right elements

253
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,560
configured in a way that we can read

254
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
them out and use them

255
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,839
in whatever the reporting mechanism

256
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,080
mechanism is again a dashboard

257
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,440
uh static report that's periodically

258
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,080
generated or

259
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,360
a live data feed through an api so all

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
the steps are going to have to happen

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,519
but they're going to happen

262
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,120
in a different way and this uh

263
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
to think about what's different about it

264
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
we have to link back to

265
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
what will make this work acceptable so

266
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
now we get into this question that we've

267
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
kind of touched on of acceptance

268
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,320
criteria which occurs in the product

269
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
backlog

270
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
and the definition of done which is the

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,560
quality of the work that the developers

272
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,160
on a scrum team are producing in our

273
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,240
increment

274
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
of course the increments accumulate from

275
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,120
sprint to sprint to sprint in order to

276
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
achieve our product goals

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,480
so the key difference from the way data

278
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,000
teams used to work

279
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,360
in a traditional environment or let's

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,519
say a waterfall environment very

281
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
project-centric environment

282
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,560
let's think about that for a second what

283
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
are we trying to achieve

284
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,399
let's keep it really simple we need to

285
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
produce a particular report

286
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,760
for a particular business purpose

287
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
there's a particular audience that we

288
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,560
would focus on

289
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
we'd understand what that business

290
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,680
purpose is why they want the data what

291
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
they're going to do with that data how

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
they're going to use that data

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,399
and then we would find the sources of

294
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,959
the information and of course it can be

295
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,480
distributed very broadly across multiple

296
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,399
systems usually it is in this

297
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
environment

298
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,160
we have to find the data first of all

299
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
and there would be we'd find all of the

300
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
data

301
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,640
and we would design uh all of the

302
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,440
interfaces to all the different data

303
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
sources

304
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
some of them may already exist some of

305
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,519
them may be brand new but we do all that

306
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
design

307
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,640
up front and we would then implement all

308
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
that

309
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,680
extraction of the data and of course we

310
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,040
will have analyzed the existing data to

311
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,160
look for data cleanliness

312
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,800
issues data error problems uh

313
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,800
redundant data and all the issues that

314
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
the audience is probably familiar with

315
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,000
we do all of that analysis and we do all

316
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
the corrections as part of our

317
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
transformation

318
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,320
and as also as part of the

319
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,000
transformation we combine the data

320
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
services together and manipulate them in

321
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
the way

322
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,480
that we'll have the actual data needed

323
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,399
for the ultimate report

324
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,079
we then that we do all the

325
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
transformation then we load all that

326
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,000
data into

327
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,000
our data repository

328
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
or get usually a data warehouse uh

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,360
depending on the technology you're using

330
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
and uh we would load all of all the data

331
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
into the data

332
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
warehouse and then we would start

333
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
working on the

334
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,920
the whole report and would create all

335
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,120
the different elements in our report

336
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
if it's a dashboard or a

337
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
hard copy output of course there'll be

338
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
formatting involved there'll be

339
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,839
visualization involved in one form or

340
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
another and we'd

341
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,760
produce the entire report and then

342
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
deliver the end result

343
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,839
okay the problem is that that process

344
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,480
takes months or longer

345
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,079
and maybe years and typically by the

346
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
time we actually deliver that report to

347
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,160
the end user

348
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,079
who requested it many months ago

349
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,200
we discover all the errors we made in

350
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,680
interpreting what they asked

351
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,880
for first problem more importantly what

352
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,399
typically happens is they don't need

353
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
that report anymore because it took too

354
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
long and now they're off and they have a

355
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,399
different need

356
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,079
which is why we need to go to something

357
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
much more responsive so in a more

358
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,959
responsive environment

359
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
we need to be able to get a little bit

360
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,480
of data directly to the user as quickly

361
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,079
as possible

362
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,600
that'll help validate that they have the

363
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,200
data they need to avoid the kind of

364
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
errors and interpretation

365
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,519
that we're still going to make we just

366
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,200
want to find them really fast

367
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
but more importantly we may discover

368
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,800
that what they ask for isn't what they

369
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
really need and we can change what we're

370
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,079
doing

371
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
as we continue to deliver in this

372
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,920
continuous fashion

373
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
but that means that the what we need to

374
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,800
do is going to look different than what

375
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,760
we're used to

376
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
from traditional development so we're

377
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
not

378
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
going to design all of the extraction up

379
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
front and identify all the data and then

380
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,399
do all the transformation that

381
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
you know that sort of relay race

382
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
waterfall

383
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,680
approach instead we're going to look at

384
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,079
the individual

385
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
information that the end user needs for

386
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,680
specific purposes

387
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
so maybe they need to understand the

388
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,000
current

389
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
uh customer ordering of a particular

390
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
product

391
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,160
and so we need that means for that

392
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,240
particular information of the

393
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,399
ordering trend of a given product we'll

394
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
need to find information on the product

395
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,519
uh itself the name of the product maybe

396
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,240
it's

397
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,200
product sku number uh we may need to

398
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,279
find information

399
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
on customer orders for that particular

400
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,680
skew number maybe there's a variety of

401
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
sku numbers

402
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
for a given product because it's a

403
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
product family we have to understand all

404
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,320
that

405
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,240
well instead of trying to collect all of

406
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
that data for this one little element of

407
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,399
the report maybe we're just going to

408
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
find

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,079
uh the product sku number that we're

410
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,440
looking for

411
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,040
and be able to load that data transform

412
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,760
it in a way that's usable in the end

413
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,279
report

414
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,800
and say here is one product okay i don't

415
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,200
have the order information yet

416
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
yep that's true we don't have that yet

417
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,440
uh but

418
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
is this the product that you're looking

419
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
for is this in a format that's usable

420
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
for you

421
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,199
yeah it's good so far i just need more

422
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
of it or they might say

423
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
well it's the product i'm looking for

424
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
but it's not in a format that i can

425
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,199
understand i can't use it that way

426
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
i don't need a sku number that doesn't

427
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,680
tell me anything i need to actually have

428
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,680
the product

429
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,440
name with its description because of

430
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
what i'm doing with this data oh okay

431
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,079
well that's important to know

432
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,079
so we don't even need to show you the

433
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
sku number we but we need to make sure

434
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,079
we've

435
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
collected the data associated with that

436
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,360
oh we're going to make a correction now

437
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
we're going to change what we're doing

438
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,920
based on feedback from the end user but

439
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,959
we need to get that feedback

440
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,480
uh certainly in you know certainly less

441
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,440
than many months that it took us to get

442
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
the whole report

443
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
in fact i'd like to be able to get

444
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
feedback like that in a matter of days

445
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,199
or maybe even hours if that were

446
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
possible

447
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,360
based on our ability now the question is

448
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,000
what do we have to do along the way to

449
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,079
collect that little bit of product data

450
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,839
to extract it from its source to

451
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,440
transform it into some useful

452
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,440
uh information and uh

453
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,360
load it so that we can then create that

454
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
bit of a maybe it was a table that has

455
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
this it has only one row in it

456
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,000
which says right now it says the

457
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,000
product's you number

458
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,680
that how we're going to work but what

459
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
we're going to do

460
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,720
is our definition of done this is what

461
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
we expect of

462
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,720
our cells in the scrum team the develop

463
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,320
what the developers are going to do

464
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,279
they're going to do some analysis of the

465
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
source data

466
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,880
they're going to create technology

467
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,040
which is often a you know software code

468
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
that will connect to that data source

469
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,480
they're going to build an extraction for

470
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
this one bit of data

471
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
they're going to uh and when they do

472
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,920
that they're going to test it by

473
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
finding different sources of data to

474
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,560
make sure the data is transmitted

475
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,279
accurately

476
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,320
so there's now we've done a an analysis

477
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
a design

478
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,360
an implementation of the code and

479
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,680
testing of that code

480
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
and that's only for this first stage or

481
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
first couple of stages of extracting and

482
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
maybe transformation

483
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,320
then there's the same thing of

484
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,240
connecting it to our data warehouse

485
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,920
we've got to make sure it it's loaded

486
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
correctly we're going to test that

487
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,279
by looking at various aspects of data

488
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,040
all along the way

489
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
we may need to collect information about

490
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,920
what we've done

491
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
because we know this is just one piece

492
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,759
of the whole puzzle and we're going to

493
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
modify it in the future

494
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,880
now a lot of people first hear what i'm

495
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,519
saying and say oh my god this will be

496
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,920
terrible well

497
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
we'll have lots of rework and

498
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,120
fundamentally rework is the wrong way of

499
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,800
thinking of it

500
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
in the agile world we're simply

501
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,600
enhancing what we already have so

502
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,800
everything we're going to do is an

503
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
enhancement

504
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
there could be rework if we make an

505
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,839
error

506
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,920
particularly an error we don't find

507
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,079
let's say that we

508
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,000
do some of the steps in our definition

509
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
of done of analysis and design and

510
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,880
implementation

511
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
but we forget or maybe there's a lot of

512
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,199
schedule pressure from outside and we

513
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,160
we skip the testing of that it'll work

514
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
it's so simple

515
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
we've done it so many times we don't

516
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
have to bother testing that

517
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,880
the problem is inevitably when you skip

518
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,040
steps like that which you might know is

519
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
creating technical debt

520
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,880
we're going to discover the errors we

521
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,360
didn't discover when we created them

522
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
some point later that's going to be

523
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,079
reworked when we have to go back and

524
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
correct something that we could have

525
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,040
found right

526
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,079
when we did it the error that we made

527
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,600
when we made it

528
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,120
corrected it right away and carried

529
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
forward with good

530
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,880
uh a good product so that good product

531
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,800
is the definition of done that we're

532
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,720
looking for

533
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,720
the thing that will make it acceptable

534
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
is the particular information in the

535
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,199
right format

536
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,400
giving the right the

537
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,760
the right level of accuracy

538
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,559
precision and visibility

539
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,079
of the data itself so that the end

540
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,839
business user can make the kind of

541
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,160
decisions they need to make

542
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,280
in this data reporting business

543
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
intelligent

544
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,720
business intelligence realm so that's

545
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,079
the acceptance criteria that's going to

546
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,919
be on the product backlog the steps

547
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,840
we're going to do to create that value

548
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,400
is the definition of done and um

549
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
i think that that's an important aspect

550
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,120
that we ought to be thinking about so

551
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,679
what what do you see on the definition

552
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
of done

553
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
you're going to see those analysis tasks

554
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
whatever they are for you you're going

555
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,360
to see design tasks

556
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
whatever those are for you that'll

557
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,360
include data modeling

558
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,280
it'll include uh code implementation

559
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,120
what interfaces do we need what objects

560
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,600
do we need in our source code

561
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,640
uh what methods are going to exist in

562
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
order to

563
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
do transformation for example that's

564
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,039
design activity as well

565
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,799
we're going to implement that through

566
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,559
code implementation

567
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,440
through creation of data models

568
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,640
through the implementation of data

569
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,559
interfaces

570
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
various signatures maybe you're passing

571
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,440
data with json or something like that

572
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,799
all of that has to be

573
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
implemented and then we've got to test

574
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,400
every step of the way those are really

575
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
common ones that we would see

576
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
in the code world that's pretty clear in

577
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,160
the reporting space

578
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,840
it's the same problem but it looks a

579
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
little bit different

580
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,840
uh because let's let's take a pdf report

581
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,919
we're going to have we're still going to

582
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,400
do analysis which is to say

583
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
what is this report going to look like

584
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
and how are we going to implement

585
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
it that's design then we have to

586
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,840
actually create the data

587
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,320
the report we have to have a report that

588
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,919
we can look at and evaluate the testing

589
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,080
to validate that it's actually doing

590
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,080
what we thought it was going to do

591
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,320
and then as we get even more mature in

592
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,160
scrum all of this has been

593
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,000
what we would call a hypothesis this is

594
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,280
what we believe the end user

595
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
is looking for that's going to create

596
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,080
the value that we need and now we want

597
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
to

598
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
validate that hypothesis and this should

599
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,200
still be part of the work that the scrum

600
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
team is doing

601
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,679
and the only way really to validate this

602
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,760
hypothesis to get the end user engaged

603
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,679
so in the case of this hard copy pdf

604
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,880
report let's give it to the user let's

605
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
talk to them about it let's get their

606
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
feedback and say is this what you need

607
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
will this solve your problem will this

608
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
allow you to make the decisions you need

609
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
to make

610
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,400
yes or no or what do we need to do to

611
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,000
make it better

612
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
that provides new information on our

613
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
product backlog so that we can really

614
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
deliver what they need

615
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,400
so again another way to say this is the

616
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,960
task that a developer would do

617
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
in their day-to-day work is the type of

618
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
things that we would see on the

619
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,720
definition of done

620
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
the things that the user needs that's in

621
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,440
the product backlog

622
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
and that'll help us understand what will

623
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,880
make this acceptable or

624
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,880
as we say acceptance criteria

625
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,240
well that brings up a good point because

626
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,159
in the data world there's often

627
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,760
well it's not it's it's true virtually

628
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
for everything but there could be a lot

629
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,559
of regulatory concerns

630
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,400
um depending on what the data is and how

631
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,080
we're using it what it's used for

632
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,919
there may be additional things we need

633
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
to do in our definition of done to

634
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
ensure compliance to

635
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,080
regulation or governance issues and that

636
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,880
could be governance

637
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,520
from within the organization or external

638
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
governance

639
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,799
again like regulators and any

640
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,280
audits that might occur either by

641
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,720
other independent organizations or by

642
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,880
government entities or whatever it might

643
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
be

644
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,840
you know that's an interesting question

645
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,120
because this can show up in either the

646
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
acceptance criteria

647
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,120
or the definition of done or both

648
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
depending on what you're doing

649
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,200
um if the end client let's imagine that

650
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
we're developing

651
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,400
uh we're one company we have a client

652
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,440
organization a different company that

653
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,960
has hired us to create a particular data

654
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,080
report and we're implementing the report

655
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
for them

656
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,080
the overall process doesn't change but

657
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,039
they need that report for some specific

658
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
business purpose

659
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,919
which includes all of their governance

660
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,320
needs their regulatory compliance needs

661
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,440
things like that all of that customer

662
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
needs

663
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,640
uh including the governance and

664
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,120
regulatory compliance needs to show up

665
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,960
in our product backlog as part of the

666
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,360
items on that backlog and the acceptance

667
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,799
criteria of those items

668
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,679
at the same time we have our own needs

669
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
because

670
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,400
what we produce is part of the the

671
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,919
quality of our product the brand image

672
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
of our organization and the way we

673
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,200
interact with our clients

674
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
and we're not willing for example to

675
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,280
give untested code to our clients

676
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,960
to fumble through and find defects let's

677
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,480
imagine we work for an organization like

678
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,840
that

679
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,159
and so our definition of done is got to

680
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,200
ensure that what we give to our clients

681
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,880
is that the that appropriate level of

682
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,919
technical quality to meet the um

683
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,360
overall objectives of our own companies

684
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,559
brand image and commitments to our

685
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
clients because there may be even

686
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,520
contractual

687
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,120
commitments around that and then of

688
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,919
course we have our own

689
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,840
governance and regulatory compliance

690
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,679
issues

691
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,000
whether that's reporting to

692
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,200
in the united states we have things like

693
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,880
sarbanes-oxley and other things that

694
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,440
virtually every company has to comply

695
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
with

696
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,520
and very often the data we collect is

697
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,159
how we demonstrate compliance

698
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,559
to the regulators of those particular

699
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,159
concerns

700
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,000
then we could have contractual

701
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,200
requirements from our client which is

702
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
another form

703
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
i mean we wouldn't call that a

704
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
regulation maybe but

705
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
there's a term or a condition in our

706
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,840
contract with our client that says we're

707
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,880
going to have done something

708
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,520
we may well need to show evidence

709
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
of perhaps they could audit us or

710
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,320
perhaps they simply

711
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,640
expect it from us as part of our

712
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,280
delivery to demonstrate that we've

713
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,080
actually done

714
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,240
some work well that would be need to be

715
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,159
part of our definition of done to record

716
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,120
the fact whatever that means

717
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,840
that we've done what's required of us

718
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
and

719
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
a lot of times the tools we use in our

720
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,360
environment maybe it's azure devops

721
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
or any other tools in our development

722
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
environment might collect some of that

723
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,039
data

724
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,480
but if it doesn't we still need to

725
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:32,960
collect it that's still required

726
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
for us to fulfill those particular needs

727
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,919
and even if we have to

728
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,440
collect it with a clipboard and a pencil

729
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,039
then that needs to be part of our

730
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,080
definition of done that we've collected

731
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,240
that particular

732
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,159
information that's necessary for the

733
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,799
operation of our organization

734
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
so again the your point is really

735
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,120
interesting and important because it

736
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,400
actually could show up as either

737
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
acceptance criteria in the product

738
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
backlog

739
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,919
or our definition of don and so

740
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,520
having a clear understanding of the

741
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,279
difference between the two is crucial

742
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,200
from that perspective

743
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,600
and even more importantly what is the

744
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
ultimate use of all this information and

745
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
what are all the different

746
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,760
dimensions of need it's not just the end

747
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
user need or the client need

748
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,799
there's also these regulatory needs

749
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,279
there's our own operation there's

750
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,039
perhaps governance from uh interaction

751
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,159
with our customers and clients

752
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,400
so all of those will have to be

753
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
considered sounds like uh

754
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
coming up with your definition of done

755
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,960
is rather complicated

756
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
well it is complicated and that's why if

757
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
our organization has been focusing on

758
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
how to

759
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,440
develop things in an agile way hopefully

760
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
the organization's helping us out

761
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
through a development whatever

762
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,000
development means

763
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,080
for us but in our case we're talking

764
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
about the data warehouse business

765
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,640
intelligence in a lot of organizations

766
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
that's its own

767
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
let's call it department or organization

768
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
and

769
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,919
ultimately i'd want that organization to

770
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
say look there's a minimum definition of

771
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
done

772
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,480
for all of the data warehouse report

773
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,679
business intelligence and reporting work

774
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,600
that we do

775
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,200
and here it is now you can go beyond

776
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
that meaning more

777
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
you can increase the quality level in

778
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,120
any team based on the need of that team

779
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
but there's a minimum below which we

780
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,799
won't go

781
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,480
but whether there's an organizational

782
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,679
definition of done or not the scrum team

783
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,279
is responsible

784
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,840
to comply with one and if they're not

785
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:23,679
given one they need to create their own

786
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,679
and then it's going to change over time

787
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,360
this is an interesting aspect of the

788
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,799
definition of done

789
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,480
sort of sounds obvious when you say it

790
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,000
but you have to be able to do the

791
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,840
definition of done i mean you have to

792
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,320
have the technical skills

793
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,320
the tools the capability to get to done

794
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,039
so let me make up a bit of an example

795
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,159
here let's say that we would like to

796
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,559
make sure we run

797
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,240
a suite of automated regression tests

798
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,760
every time we modify

799
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,679
our data warehouse and our report

800
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,039
and we think that's an awesome way to

801
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,279
ensure the technical quality of our work

802
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,159
if we put that in the definition of done

803
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,000
but we have no

804
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,279
ability to run automated regression

805
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
tests in fact we don't even have

806
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,279
automated regression tests

807
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,039
then our work can't be done so

808
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
what we what is the work we're going to

809
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,640
need what will it take for us to get to

810
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,760
that awesome capability of automated

811
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
regression tests

812
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,159
we need frameworks we need tests we need

813
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,919
et cetera et cetera et cetera we need

814
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,159
continuous integration and deployment

815
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,760
ultimately which of course azure devops

816
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
can give us all of that stuff but if we

817
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,520
don't write the automated tests

818
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,360
there won't be any automated testing

819
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,919
which means we would not have done work

820
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,000
ever so in the meantime we have an

821
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,320
aspiration to get

822
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,640
to this automated regression test idea

823
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,240
but we can't do it yet

824
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,840
before we can change the definition of

825
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,120
done we're going to have to go do

826
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,880
the work that's necessary and maybe this

827
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
team is doing that work so maybe there's

828
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
some

829
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,760
fraction of our capacity we're going to

830
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,159
do to create that while we're still

831
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,360
building the k the the data warehouse

832
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,919
and the reporting and delivering value

833
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,919
in the way we're currently able so we

834
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,840
got to keep delivering value otherwise

835
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,039
we're not valuable and as we gain new

836
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
capability

837
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,080
in raising the bar of technical quality

838
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,320
like

839
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,760
the ability to begin doing a few

840
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,840
automated tests

841
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,679
we can start to modify our definition of

842
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,399
done to include

843
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,480
maybe a few key automated tests even

844
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,000
though there might still be many tests

845
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,919
that are not automated it doesn't mean

846
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,360
they're not necessary anymore

847
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
it means we'll need to do them in the

848
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,799
way we used to do them until we can

849
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,960
automate those as well if that's part of

850
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,960
our goal so the definition of done will

851
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,320
modify over time as we continue to raise

852
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
the bar

853
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,279
on our technical quality and the

854
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,720
delivery to our customers

855
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,200
as well as meeting the overall

856
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,039
objectives of our own organization

857
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,880
automating tests is one key way to get

858
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,000
faster at things because computers are

859
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
really good at that type of

860
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,559
work that sort of repetitive

861
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,919
step-by-step things computers should do

862
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,799
that work we shouldn't be doing that

863
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,039
manually

864
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,720
that'll take a lot of our manual effort

865
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,480
away and allow us to focus on other

866
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,960
things that humans are really good at

867
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
that analysis part the design part the

868
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
implementation part

869
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,640
those creative aspects are what humans

870
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
are good at and as we get computers to

871
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,159
do more and more of the manual

872
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
stuff that the computers are good at

873
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,120
will get faster at what we're doing

874
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,080
that's usually a goal for the

875
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,240
organization because

876
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,799
i've never encountered a data reporting

877
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,880
group that didn't have too much to do

878
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,880
so finding ways to be able to get faster

879
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,240
would be great

880
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,279
well um i would say that the hardest

881
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,039
part of all this

882
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,720
really isn't you know the events of

883
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,480
scrum or the artifacts

884
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
having a product backlog or a sprint

885
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
backlog or even in

886
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,799
an increment per se or even having a

887
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,720
definition of done the real hard part is

888
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,279
thinking about this problem in this new

889
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,880
way uh most people try to use all of

890
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,240
their waterfall practices in the scrum

891
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
environment and you know fundamentally

892
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
you're just not going to get very much

893
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,919
benefit

894
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,279
i'll even be bold enough to see it just

895
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,000
doesn't work

896
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,039
so um learning to think in this new way

897
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
is the hard part

898
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,640
so there is a reference work i usually

899
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,440
point to people

900
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
in in the in the state of space ken

901
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,880
collier

902
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,960
who uh he may still be i at least was

903
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,960
the chief technology officer

904
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,399
of thoughtworks which is a pretty famous

905
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,799
maybe some would say infamous i don't

906
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,320
know but um the agile software

907
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,840
development organization

908
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
and ken collier wrote a book called

909
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,559
agile analytics

910
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,399
so this book breaks down how do you

911
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,919
develop data warehouse and reporting

912
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,520
capability

913
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,520
for your organization whether that's for

914
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,000
clients or within your own company

915
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,360
using agile practices and as he breaks

916
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,559
down how to do it

917
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
helps understand what are the

918
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
consequences and talk through how it's

919
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,240
different and

920
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,640
overcoming the different objections that

921
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,200
people have because this new way

922
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,880
of working seems to be quote unquote

923
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,799
inefficient

924
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,399
and from the old way of thinking it

925
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,399
probably is

926
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,159
but it's so much more effective in

927
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,240
delivering real value

928
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,679
that it's worth it um also as we grow

929
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,159
the definition of done

930
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,960
just to link this back in and ken's book

931
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,159
and again agile analytics by ken collier

932
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,000
as he talks about the different

933
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,080
practices you needed to adopt

934
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,360
like automated testing and continuous

935
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
integration and delivery and all of

936
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,200
those practices

937
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,679
as they apply in the in the data space

938
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,159
will actually get to be very efficient

939
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,840
in addition to being very effective

940
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:37,840
which is really the ultimate goal for

941
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,840
any group like this

942
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,880
yeah do they really are they going to

943
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,080
use and get them not just even use but

944
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
are they really going to achieve

945
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,360
their goals the customers goals are they

946
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
achieving their goals

947
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,880
with what we deliver and that'll require

948
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
this

949
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,600
new way of working so that we can

950
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,080
validate our hypothesis along the way

951
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,840
but also continue to raise the bar on

952
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,240
how we're developing in such a way that

953
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
we can do this very very rapidly

954
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,919
and adapt what we're doing so they get

955
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,200
better benefit maybe even than they

956
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,640
thought of

957
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,480
and um that's the way we're going to

958
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
beat our competition whatever that is in

959
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,799
the data world our competitors are often

960
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,919
you know excel spreadsheets and data

961
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,799
dumps that people are

962
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,799
are manually manipulating and unless we

963
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,840
can deliver something better and faster

964
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,279
than that

965
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,200
they're going to continue to use those

966
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,640
approaches and

967
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,320
what value we're delivering will always

968
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,000
be in question so

969
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,200
but that's that's the ultimate goal

970
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,799
we've got to help our customers be

971
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,640
successful that's the only way we can be

972
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,720
successful
