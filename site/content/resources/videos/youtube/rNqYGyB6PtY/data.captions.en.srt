1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,920
so the question is what does a product

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,400
owner

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:11,360
do if the team are

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,839
incompetent well if it's really that bad

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,199
and the team really are incompetent I

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,800
would say fire them and get a new team

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,240
that's ultimately where I would where I

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,320
would go with that now that predisposes

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,519
obviously we're going to try our hardest

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,600
to engage with that team to to enable

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,160
them to have every opportunity to

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,239
improve um all of the things that you

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
would expect to happen right we not

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,200
[Â __Â ] we're not just going to fire

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,920
people for no reason uh but the fact

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,719
that the question

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,160
is the team is

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,920
incompetent don't work with incompetent

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,840
people don't hire incompetent people

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,079
don't keep incompetent people they are

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,199
not the people you need in your business

22
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,119
to be successful um amazing teams build

23
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,240
amazing products and amazing teams don't

24
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:07,360
come from

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,560
incompetence um so get rid of those

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,240
folks as as quickly as you humanly can

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,280
now if it's they don't know something

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,880
that they could have known that's not

29
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,360
necessarily incompetence you want to

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,680
provide them with training opportunities

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,360
you want to provide them with knowledge

32
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,360
opportunities you want to provide them

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,439
with um I

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,159
yeah I don't know I've never worked with

35
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,159
a a truly I've never actually met

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,920
actually that is not true well it's kind

37
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,520
of true kind of not true I was going to

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,880
say I've never actually worked with a

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,360
truly incompetent team um but I

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,960
have but they

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,159
were not incompetent in their favor if

42
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,960
that makes sense um so I worked with a a

43
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,240
team in an organization it was a bank

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,560
and they had uh um

45
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,159
man I'm trying to think of other teams

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,079
yeah plenty of other teams I've worked

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,679
with that that that present as

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,040
incompetent that actually aren't so this

49
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:17,400
team that I'm talking about they they

50
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:19,680
they have I I was a lowly devops

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,040
consultant helping uh a part of the

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,920
organization transition from what they

53
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,920
were using before into uh Azure devops

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,319
TFS at the time and this was Java teams

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
so at the time if you if you were a Java

56
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,640
team and you had to use TFS you were

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,599
already a little bit hostile towards it

58
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,159
right so there that but this particular

59
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,400
team uh didn't want to use Source

60
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:46,120
control they they believed that it would

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,159
slow them down that's their their uh uh

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,000
uh comment on um Source control and I

63
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,959
kind of kind of asked them I challenged

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,040
them a little bit and said well why do

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
you think it would slow you down and

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,840
they're like well if we need to make

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,000
make changes we just just log into the

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,599
environment and make the Chang changes

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,360
so I asked them about how you know how

70
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,319
do they develop and it's like well we

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,360
just log into the the the server the

72
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,480
production server we open up our our IDE

73
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,680
we make changes to the code and we we

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,120
publish it right away and I was kind of

75
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,159
like but how do

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,879
you how do you do that publish and

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,280
they're like well we just click the

78
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,239
publish button and it goes straight into

79
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
production so already I'm horrified

80
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,480
right I was horrified already even more

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
horrified

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,280
now and then I asked cuz they have five

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,040
servers around the world I said how do

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,879
you keep all of those servers in sync

85
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,680
you know how do you make the changes

86
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,400
across all of those servers and they

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,760
said that's why there's five of us was

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
five people on this team each one owned

89
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,560
a server independently and when there

90
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,159
were changes needed to the to the code

91
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,799
um they would they would all log in

92
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,840
independently write their own code in in

93
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:05,760
their own way on their server in order

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,680
to um action those changes so I was I

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,040
was even more horrified and then you

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
find out that it's the realtime banking

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,319
transaction system for a multinational

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,639
bank and now you don't want to you know

99
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,799
keep your money in a bank anymore and

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,199
the those types of teams I they they

101
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,560
they were there was a strategic

102
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,919
incompetence right because they're

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,240
they're making sure the bank can never

104
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,720
fire them and when I brought it up with

105
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,600
with Le ERS ship and said that this is a

106
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,400
massive risk to your business they said

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,680
we know but if we say anything they'll

108
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,919
leave and then what do we do right so

109
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,600
this this small group of people we're

110
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:50,320
holding an entire multinational Bank

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,320
hostage um for for this this this piece

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,320
of software and that's that's not okay

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,000
that's that's that goes beyond

114
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,520
incompetence towards Mal levance right

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,479
um and that level of Mal malel evance

116
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,280
the

117
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,639
organization this would be my

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,919
recommendation the organization needs to

119
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,520
fire that entire group of

120
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,800
people and take their lumps for figuring

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,080
out how to resolve the problem right of

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,120
actually figuring out the software

123
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,240
getting it out of those servers if those

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,199
people are still around they're going to

125
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,319
sabotage that at all costs because it's

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,800
their their their property they believe

127
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,160
it's their property they believe they

128
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,639
control it so if you have a truly melant

129
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,000
team definitely fire them if you have an

130
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,800
incompetent team probably probably fire

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,440
them but be careful that you're not

132
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,680
reading incompetence into just they

133
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,919
don't know stuff they've never been

134
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,440
told I've worked with teams that don't

135
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,000
understand how Source control works that

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,000
they know how branching works but they

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,039
didn't know how merging worked cuz

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,120
nobody had ever explained it to them um

139
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,560
so teach them as best they can get rid

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,560
of the Mal

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,000
elevant uh work on the incompetence But

142
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,880
ultimately if if they're that bad get

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
rid of them thanks for watching the
