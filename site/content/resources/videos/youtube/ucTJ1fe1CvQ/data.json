    "description": "In this video, I dive into the critical importance of addressing assumptions in complex product development environments. Whether you're a product leader, owner, manager, or part of a product team, this video is for you. \n\nWe all know how easy it is to get caught up in the delivery process, focusing solely on creating product increments. But are we truly solving the right problems for our users? This video will help you understand the dangers of unconscious assumptions and the risks of turning your development process into a \"feature factory.\"\n\nI’ll guide you through how to better incorporate discovery, validation, and learning into your product development processes, ensuring you're creating high-value products that genuinely meet user needs. \n\nBy the end of this video, you'll have a clearer understanding of how to navigate the complexities of product development, focusing on what works best for your users. This is a must-watch if you want to shift from merely delivering features to creating impactful, user-centered products.\n\n**Chapters:**\n\n1. **Introduction - The Why Behind the Course (00:00-00:40)**\n   - Understanding the critical focus of the course: addressing assumptions in product development.\n\n2. **The Importance of Beyond Delivery (00:40-01:17)**\n   - Why solving complex problems requires more than just delivering product increments.\n\n3. **The Danger of Unconscious Assumptions (01:17-02:01)**\n   - How assumptions can lead to missed learning opportunities and create a feature factory problem.\n\n4. **Factors Contributing to Feature Factory Problems (02:01-02:54)**\n   - Examining the root causes, including insufficient user understanding and reactionary development.\n\n5. **Navigating Around Assumptions (02:54-03:58)**\n   - The importance of navigating assumptions in a complex environment to create high-value products.\n\n6. **The Course Approach: Discovery, Delivery, and Validation (03:58-04:46)**\n   - Introducing the course’s framework for product development: discovery, delivery, and validation.\n\n7. **Who Will Benefit from This Course? (04:46-05:31)**\n   - Identifying the target audience for the course and how it benefits different product roles.\n\n8. **Learning and Experimentation Focus (05:31-End)**\n   - Emphasizing the course's focus on conscious learning, experimentation, and evidence collection for better product development.\n\nVisit https://www.nkdagility.com to register for the PPDV course with Joanna Plaskonka",
