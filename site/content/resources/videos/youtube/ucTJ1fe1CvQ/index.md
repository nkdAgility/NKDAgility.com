## **Why the PPDV Course Was Created**

In the fast-paced world of product development, there‚Äôs a strong emphasis on delivery. Teams are often laser-focused on producing product increments at the end of every sprint. However, this approach, while essential, is not enough. **Why?** Because we‚Äôre not just delivering products; we‚Äôre solving complex problems.

Complexity means uncertainty, and uncertainty means assumptions. Throughout the product development journey, teams make countless assumptions. The problem? Many of these assumptions are made unconsciously, leading to missed learning opportunities and the infamous **‚ÄúFeature Factory‚Äù** issue, where teams churn out features without truly understanding user needs or delivering real value.

### **The Importance of Beyond Delivery**

While delivery is crucial, it‚Äôs just one piece of the puzzle. The real challenge lies in navigating the complex environment where unknowns abound. We often overlook the importance of challenging our assumptions, which is vital to solving complex problems effectively.

Here‚Äôs the crux: **Are we truly solving the right problems for our users?** Without questioning and validating our assumptions, we risk building features that may not address the users' needs or provide them with the most value.

## **The Danger of Unconscious Assumptions**

Unconscious assumptions can be a silent killer in product development. We make an assumption, take the next step, and in doing so, miss a crucial learning opportunity. This is a slippery slope that can lead to the **‚ÄúFeature Factory‚Äù** problem.

### **Feature Factory: A Closer Look**

- **Stakeholder-Driven Development:** When strong stakeholders dictate the product roadmap without sufficient user understanding, teams may end up building features that don‚Äôt resonate with users.

- **Insufficient User Understanding:** We might believe that what users say is the truth. But do we truly understand their needs? Do we have all the necessary data and evidence to find the best solutions?

- **Reactionary Development:** Sometimes, teams rush to build features just because a competitor did it. But is this really the right move?

- **Poor Collaboration:** Inadequate collaboration with stakeholders can lead to misaligned goals and a lack of shared understanding.

- **Misaligned Metrics:** Choosing the wrong metrics can steer the team in the wrong direction, focusing on outputs rather than outcomes.

These factors contribute to the Feature Factory problem, where teams are busy building features but may not be creating meaningful value.

## **Navigating Around Assumptions**

So, what can we do to avoid falling into these traps? The key is to **navigate around assumptions** effectively. In a complex environment, we often don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know. This is why it‚Äôs crucial to create a path that allows us to explore, validate, and adjust our assumptions continuously.

### **The Course Approach: Discovery, Delivery, and Validation**

Our new course is designed to help teams embrace the full **end-to-end empirical cycle**‚ÄîDiscovery, Delivery, and Validation. These three elements work together to help us navigate around assumptions and build products that truly matter.

- **Discovery:** This is where we uncover what users really need. It‚Äôs about exploring different ideas, gathering insights, and challenging our initial assumptions.

- **Delivery:** Once we have a better understanding of the user needs, we move on to delivery. But this is not just about building; it‚Äôs about iterating and refining based on what we learn.

- **Validation:** Finally, we validate our assumptions by testing the product with real users. This step ensures that we‚Äôre on the right track and that our product delivers real value.

### **Who Will Benefit from This Course?**

This course is designed for **product leaders, product owners, product managers**, and **product teams** in general. We believe that anyone involved in the product development process will gain valuable insights from this class.

- **Product Leaders:** Learn how to steer your team away from the Feature Factory mindset and towards creating real value.

- **Product Owners and Managers:** Gain the tools to better incorporate Discovery and Validation into your process, ensuring that your products solve the right problems.

- **Product Teams:** Understand how to work more effectively with assumptions and develop a learning mindset that drives continuous improvement.

## **Learning and Experimentation Focus**

In this one-day course (which can also be split into two half-days or smaller chunks), we use a **case study** to navigate through different concepts. This hands-on approach helps teams better incorporate Discovery and Validation into their product development process.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Working with Assumptions:** Learn how to consciously recognize and challenge assumptions throughout the product development cycle.

- **Experimentation:** Develop a culture of experimentation where teams continuously test and validate their ideas.

- **Collecting Evidence:** Understand the importance of evidence-based decision-making in creating valuable products.

- **Learning:** Embrace a learning mindset that allows for continuous improvement and innovation.

By focusing on these elements, teams will not only build better products but also develop a deeper understanding of the problems they are solving. This conscious learning process is the cornerstone of the PPDV course, making it an essential tool for any team looking to excel in product development.
