# PPDV course overview

In this video, I dive into the critical importance of addressing assumptions in complex product development environments. Whether you're a product leader, owner, manager, or part of a product team, this video is for you. 

We all know how easy it is to get caught up in the delivery process, focusing solely on creating product increments. But are we truly solving the right problems for our users? This video will help you understand the dangers of unconscious assumptions and the risks of turning your development process into a "feature factory."

I’ll guide you through how to better incorporate discovery, validation, and learning into your product development processes, ensuring you're creating high-value products that genuinely meet user needs. 

By the end of this video, you'll have a clearer understanding of how to navigate the complexities of product development, focusing on what works best for your users. This is a must-watch if you want to shift from merely delivering features to creating impactful, user-centered products.
