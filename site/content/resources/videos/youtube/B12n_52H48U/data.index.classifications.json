    "reasoning": "The content focuses on decision-making by product owners in Agile contexts, exploring strategic thinking, adaptability, and continuous improvement. However, OKRs are never directly mentioned, nor is their framework or terminology invoked. While the post covers outcome-orientation and alignment with strategic goals (reminiscent of some OKR themes), it neither references John Doerr, the 'four superpowers,' nor explores OKRs as a systemic measurement tool. Discussion remains at the level of general agile strategy and mindset, without direct tie-ins to OKR practices, process, or pitfalls.",

    "reasoning": "The content focuses on the decision-making process of product owners in Agile contexts, emphasizing autonomy and adaptability. While these themes overlap with aspects of Agentic Engineering (e.g., agency, feedback, reflection), the discussion remains general to Agile best practices. There are no direct references to Agentic Engineering, systemic observability, DevOps-Infused Craft, or explicit human/AI agency. Content is aimed at practitioners and is relevant but not deeply aligned to the conceptual depth and breadth of Agentic Engineering as strictly defined.",
    "reasoning_summary": "This content partially aligns with Agentic Engineering as it emphasizes autonomy, feedback-driven adaptation, and agency in decision-making. However, it remains focused on general Agile product ownership without directly engaging with Agentic Engineering's core concepts or terminology.",

    "reasoning": "The content thoroughly discusses Agile decision-making, specifically focusing on product owners' judgement in pivoting or persevering based on data, instinct, feedback, and adaptability. However, it does not mention or address integration of AI agents, agency, contextual intelligence, or agentic frameworks. The focus is on traditional Agile roles and methods, not on combining human and machine agency or introducing autonomous AI into delivery pipelines. No outdated practices, satire, or contradictions are present. The audience and intent are compatible with modern Agile practitioners, but topic relevance to agentic software delivery is minimal.",
    "reasoning_summary": "Content focuses on Agile decision-making by human product owners; no references to AI agents, agency, or agentic delivery principles. Partial thematic overlap in adaptability and feedback, but fit with Agentic Software Delivery is weak and indirect.",
