1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:11,820
so the question is how do you decide

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:15,540
whether you pivot or stay the course and

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,359
this is something that quite often will

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,279
need to make a decision at either at the

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,460
Sprint review or pretty pretty close

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,260
pretty close after it where the product

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,619
owner

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,539
um decides whether we're going to Pivot

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,980
and change direction based on what we

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,160
learned

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,260
um cancel the whole thing

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,660
or or or we need to we need to stay the

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,120
course and I think

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,040
um it I mean it's going to depend on an

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,360
awful lot of factors there's loads of

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,640
things that the product owner is going

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,920
to have to take into account

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,020
um what the what the business wants the

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,700
direction the business is going uh what

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,340
the stakeholders want if they're

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,379
separate groups

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,879
um what the customers want and what

23
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:01,739
direction is going and what the team

24
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,600
wants as well and what the state of the

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,519
current state of the product so all of

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,140
that information kind of comes into this

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,119
funnel and then you have to make that

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,340
decision and sometimes the right

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
decision is to is to walk away

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,299
so sometimes that's going to be the

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,520
right decision

32
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,920
and it actually you you wanna you wanna

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,900
be really careful and avoid the the sunk

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,259
cost fallacy

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,119
right where if you've invested so much

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,580
money in something

37
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,979
um that you you you feel like you can't

38
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,420
let it go and you have to keep moving it

39
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,939
Forward

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,180
um I worked at a a bank here in the UK

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,400
called intelligent Finance

42
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,220
um and they were anything but by the way

43
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,020
it was an oxymoron but they had this

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,600
this XML based uh form generation system

45
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,820
and they invested so much money in it

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,700
that they had to use it and they kept

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,979
using it going forward even though it

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,740
was demonstratively and arguably the

49
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,079
wrong uh implementation that there are

50
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,820
better ways to solve the problem

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,099
um that that when it was solved at the

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,679
time right that was the right way and I

53
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,780
think that's an example of staying the

54
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,739
course when you shouldn't stay the

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,319
course

56
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,640
right that should just be let's figure

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,220
out how to solve this problem a

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,420
different way that's that's more more

59
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,720
effective

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,980
another great example probably one of my

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,220
favorites is is is Nokia right Microsoft

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,739
bought Nokia

63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,520
um and Satya had to make a choice right

64
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,020
do we do we stay the course do we keep

65
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,500
moving forward

66
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,140
or um do we pivot right maybe we do

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,739
something a little bit different or do

68
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,319
we have to just abandon it

69
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,180
um and his choice uh based on all the

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,420
information he had at the time was to to

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,940
abandon it which was probably the right

72
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,300
choice to make but that was what uh

73
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,180
eight nine billion dollar write-off

74
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,860
of of investment Microsoft had just

75
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,500
bought it

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,840
um And he as soon as he came in as CEO

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,340
he actually there's there's if you've

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,280
read his book

79
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,220
um he he arrived at Microsoft just too

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,659
late to stop the deal

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,640
um he didn't want the deal to go through

82
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,159
at all and it was too late for it to

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,480
stop so it was immediately upon the

84
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,040
purchase

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,239
um he's like we're gonna have to we're

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,220
gonna have to write this down we're

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,260
gonna have to write it off

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,239
um and the implications are huge right

89
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,680
because that has implications are at

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,720
that level that has implications on

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,060
share price it has implications on other

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,340
companies on vendors on

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,220
um all of the companies that have built

94
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,459
up uh uh things that they were building

95
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,580
on top or delivering in combination with

96
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,459
um Windows phone and yeah they had to

97
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,540
they just had to kill it

98
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:02,519
so as a product owner

99
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,680
you're accountable right in that case

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,140
Satya was the product owner product

101
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,360
owner for Microsoft the CEO

102
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:12,360
um hopefully your decisions won't be as

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,120
big or as scary as that but they can be

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,160
as big and scary within the context of

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,540
what it is that that you're doing and

106
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,120
you

107
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,120
it's your call right

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,180
um and you need to make that call with

109
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,800
incomplete information if you wait long

110
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,720
enough that you've gotten all the

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,500
information you need it might be too

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
late

113
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,419
so sometimes you have to make that call

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,000
place that bet or fold

115
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,880
um when when based on the information

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
you have based on your gut you've got

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
the data available and then add your gut

118
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,660
feel to it what do you think is going to

119
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,220
happen and work for probabilities

120
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,160
um so don't keep investing in something

121
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,199
that you don't believe is going anywhere
