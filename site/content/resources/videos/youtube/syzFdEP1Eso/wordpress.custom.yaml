  - "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When we talk about Scrum, one of the most critical elements that often gets overlooked is the <strong>Definition of Done</strong>. It's one of those terms that seem straightforward on the surface, but once you dig into it, there's a lot more than meets the eye. Today, we’ll explore why the Definition of Done is crucial, how it’s independent of the solution you're working on, and how it can be applied universally to different projects—whether you're developing software or running a bakery!</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-is-the-definition-of-done\"><strong>What is the Definition of Done?</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At its core, the Definition of Done (DoD) is not about the product or solution you're creating. It doesn’t define the final outcome or how your product should look. Instead, the DoD defines the <strong>level of quality</strong> required for the product to be considered complete. This is important because the quality standards you set in your Definition of Done ensure that the work you produce is not just \"finished,\" but ready to deliver.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Definition of Done helps you:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Ensure the product meets your organization’s quality standards.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Protect your customers by delivering a reliable and robust product.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>Safeguard your brand and business from potential issues.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, how do you create a DoD that fits any project, even when you're unsure of the final solution? Let’s break it down with a fun analogy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-bakery-analogy\"><strong>The Bakery Analogy </strong><strong>🍩🥖</strong><strong></strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Imagine you’ve decided to quit your current job and open a bakery. You’re going to sell <strong>donuts</strong> and <strong>baguettes</strong>—two very different products with different ingredients, recipes, and preparation methods. The <strong>acceptance criteria</strong> for each product will be specific to what they are:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Donuts</strong> are typically round, fried, dusted with sugar, and sometimes filled with something sweet.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Baguettes</strong> are long rods of dough, cut in a specific way to create that iconic twist on top, and baked to a golden brown.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>While these products differ in almost every aspect, certain universal standards apply to both. These standards are your <strong>Definition of Done</strong>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-universal-standards-for-all-products\"><strong>Universal Standards for All Products</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>No matter what you’re baking, the following things must be true for every product in your bakery:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🧼 <strong>The kitchen is clean at the time of preparation</strong> – A fundamental requirement that ensures hygiene and safety.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🥚 <strong>All ingredients are fresh</strong> – Fresh ingredients lead to higher quality products, reducing the chance of complaints or health risks.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>👩‍🍳 <strong>Each batch is taste-tested before it goes on sale</strong> – You want to make sure the product is up to standard before selling it to customers.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>These criteria form the <strong>Definition of Done</strong> for your bakery. They have nothing to do with the type of product (whether it’s a donut or a baguette), but they ensure that everything leaving your kitchen is safe and of high quality.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-adding-new-products-adjusting-the-definition-of-done\"><strong>Adding New Products, Adjusting the Definition of Done</strong></h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As your bakery grows, you might add new items, like a <strong>steak pie</strong>. Since you’re now working with meat, you’ll need to add an additional criterion:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🔥 <strong>Cook to the appropriate temperature</strong> – This ensures that your meat products are safe to consume and free from harmful bacteria like salmonella.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This new criterion, while specific to your steak pies, might also apply to other items if relevant. The point is, your Definition of Done evolves as your offerings grow, but it always focuses on <strong>quality</strong>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-applying-the-bakery-analogy-to-software-development\"><strong>Applying the Bakery Analogy to Software Development </strong><strong>💻</strong><strong></strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now, let's bring this analogy back to <strong>software development</strong>. Just like in the bakery, you have different products (or features) with their own specific <strong>acceptance criteria</strong>. But what remains consistent is the Definition of Done, which ensures that everything you ship meets your company’s quality standards.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Here are some examples of universal criteria that might form your DoD in a software project:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🛡 <strong>Code is peer-reviewed</strong> – This ensures that at least one other developer has validated the code for quality, functionality, and maintainability.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🧪 <strong>All unit tests pass</strong> – Your code is only as good as your tests. If tests are failing, your code isn’t complete.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>🔍 <strong>No critical bugs remain</strong> – Before shipping, ensure there are no critical bugs that would impact the user experience or the system’s stability.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li>📝 <strong>Documentation is updated</strong> – Any changes to the codebase should be accompanied by updates to relevant documentation to ensure long-term maintainability.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>These criteria ensure that every feature, regardless of its complexity, is <strong>done</strong>. Notice how none of these items define what the solution looks like—they only focus on the <strong>quality</strong> of the work being delivered.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-does-the-definition-of-done-matter\"><strong>Why Does the Definition of Done Matter?</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Definition of Done is not just a checklist; it's a safeguard for your product, your brand, and your customers. It ensures that you’re not just building things fast, but also building them right. Here’s why it's important:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":1} -->\r\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: By adhering to your Definition of Done, you’re ensuring that your product is of the highest quality possible. It reduces defects and minimizes the risk of post-release issues.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong>: Delivering a well-tested, fully functional product ensures a better experience for your customers, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Team Alignment</strong>: When the team shares a clear understanding of what \"done\" means, everyone works towards the same goal, reducing confusion and misalignment.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Brand Protection</strong>: Delivering faulty or incomplete products can damage your reputation. The Definition of Done protects your brand by ensuring that everything you deliver meets a certain standard.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-practical-advice-for-defining-your-dod\"><strong>Practical Advice for Defining Your DoD</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Defining a strong DoD can seem tricky, especially when you're not entirely sure what the final solution will look like. Here are a few tips to help you craft a useful and effective DoD for your team:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Focus on Quality, Not Quantity</strong>: The Definition of Done is about the level of quality, not the quantity of features. Ensure each feature or increment is of high quality before moving on.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Make it Universal</strong>: Your DoD should apply to all deliverables, regardless of their specific acceptance criteria. For example, every feature should be peer-reviewed, fully tested, and documented.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Involve the Team</strong>: Create your DoD collaboratively. Get input from developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure that it meets everyone's needs and expectations.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\r\n<li><strong>Review and Adapt</strong>: Your DoD is not set in stone. Just like in the bakery analogy, you may need to adjust it as your product evolves. Regularly review it with your team and make changes as necessary.</li>\r\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Definition of Done is a powerful tool in Scrum and software development. It’s not about defining the final solution but about ensuring that whatever you deliver is of the highest quality. Just like in a bakery, whether you're making donuts or baguettes, the standards you set ensure that your customers are happy, and your business thrives.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So next time you’re working on a feature, remember: the Definition of Done is there to protect you, your team, and your customers. It’s not just a checklist—it’s a commitment to excellence. 🎉 <strong>Happy baking... or coding!</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
