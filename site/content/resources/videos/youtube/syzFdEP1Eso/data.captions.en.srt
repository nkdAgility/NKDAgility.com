1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,279
this is one of my favorite questions so

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,040
the question is how do you define a

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,480
definition of done if you aren't 100%

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,000
sure what the solution is going to look

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,639
like and I would say easy because the

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,320
definition of done has nothing to do

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:21,320
with the solution absolutely zero to do

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,560
with the solution that you're trying to

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,439
create the definition of done is the

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,279
level of quality that each thing needs

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,239
to meet in order for it to be an even

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,280
viable solution right so let's let's

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,000
let's let's use an analogy because

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,680
that's always always great for these

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,680
things let's say uh you've decided to

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,440
quit quit quit your job in this it or

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
whatever Malarkey you're in at the

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,120
moment and you are going to go open a

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,719
bakery right you're going to go open a

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,960
bakery in this Bakery uh you've decided

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,800
that your your new products that you're

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,400
going to ship in this Bakery are donuts

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,159
and baguettes

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,759
right donuts and baguettes have very

25
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,439
different recipes one's made with sugar

26
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:17,759
and one's made with salt right um so if

27
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,040
you have these two different products

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
that have different characteristics you

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,560
could say that you're you're you have a

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,520
different recipe for each one you have a

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,360
different um characteristics you would

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,640
like each one to be right let's call

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:40,840
them acceptance criteria in order for

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,799
you to accept your your dut is in fact a

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,360
dut it normally has to

36
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,719
be

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,159
round it has a hole in the middle or no

38
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,920
hole in the middle if it's filled with

39
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,159
something right it should be fried and

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,640
dusted with

41
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:04,479
sugar right Donuts very tasty right the

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,520
other tasty thing is baguettes if a

43
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,640
baguette looked like a donut that would

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,480
be a bit weird I'm not going to fry my

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,680
baguette and dust it with sugar right

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
what I am going to do is I'm going to

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,000
create a a a

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,400
long tubes of dough tubes that's not the

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,760
right word long rods of dough that then

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,440
go in the oven and you need to cut it in

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,519
a particular way to get that kind of

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,440
twisty thing that you see on the top and

53
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,800
they to be golden brown um and they're

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,120
not sweet right those are those are

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,840
maybe some characteristics some

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,519
definitions of of of acceptance criteria

57
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:46,480
for for uh baguettes make sense so far

58
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,599
okay what needs to be

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,840
true for both of those products in order

60
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,840
for you to ship it the

61
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
customers not specific to any particular

62
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
thing thing you're shipping in your

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,680
bakery what needs to be true for both of

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,120
those

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,400
things I would

66
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,560
suggest um kitchen is clean at time of

67
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,599
preparation that would be good you could

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,440
swap that out with Meats local Health

69
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:23,040
standards right all ingredients are

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,720
fresh at time of

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
preparation right you don't want to be

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,439
making with moldy or or or per quality

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
products right the better quality of the

74
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,360
product input the better quality of the

75
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,760
output

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,239
um and each batch is taste tested before

77
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,400
it goes on the

78
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,400
Shelf before it goes on on on

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,239
sale there's your definition of

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,400
done and those three things have nothing

81
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,120
to do with what your Baker is

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,760
creating a bakery in fact I would

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,239
suggest that those three things should

84
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,840
be true for any Kitchen in the world

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:06,840
preparing in any type of food right once

86
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,920
your bakery decides to add some meat

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,920
products right let's say you want to to

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,159
have some kind of pie uh steak pie or

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,040
something you're going to sell as well

90
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,560
suddenly you might need to add an extra

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,000
thing to your definition of done and

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,639
that might be heated to the appropriate

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,040
temperature right because you want to

94
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
cook the meat you don't want people to

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,440
get salmonella and all of those nasty

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
germs you need to kill the germ terms

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,080
but that new definition of done cook to

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,280
the appropriate temperature still

99
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,360
applies to donuts and still applies to

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,199
beet right so all four of those things

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,400
can then be true for every single thing

102
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,919
you create in your

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,520
kitchen that's the definition of done

104
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,840
it's about quality of the product how do

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,360
we ensure that we don't make our

106
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,199
customers sick that we don't make put

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,240
ourselves out of business

108
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,800
that we have happy and successful

109
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,199
customers that's your definition of done

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,759
so it has nothing to do with what you're

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,160
making in your kitchen so let's apply

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,880
that to to software world right what

113
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,560
needs to be on your definition of

114
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,080
done for you to be sure that you're

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,759
protecting your

116
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,840
customers that you're protecting your

117
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,039
brand that you're protecting your

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,960
business and you're protecting

119
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,440
yourselves what you need needs to be

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,199
true that would be your definition of d
